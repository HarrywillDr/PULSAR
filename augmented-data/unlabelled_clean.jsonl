There was also a 5mm  gallstone in the common bile duct, without ductal dilatation.  The patient was evaluated by surgery for her choledocholithiasis.  The patient was also seen by the ERCP fellow.  The patient was not acutely ill last night, so she was admitted to the Medicine team, with plan for ERCP today. She was kept NPO and was administered IVF overnight.   This morning, she was administered 4 U FFP to reverse her INR.  After receiving 2 U FFP, she became hypoxic, with O2 sats dropping to the 70s.  She was placed on 100% NRB with improvement in her O2 sats to the 90s. Prior to dialysis, she was given 100 mg IV Lasix, with urine output (non measured).  At 1:50 PM, she was transferred to the Hemodialysis Unit for initiation of hemodialysis.  Approximately 1 L was removed, yet the patient remained in respiratory distress, with O2 sats in the low 90s on NRB.  At 2:30 PM, a respiratory code was called since patient's O2 sats dropped to 70s on the NRB.  The patient was emergently intubated.  ABG prior to intubation was 7.21/55/55.  EKG disclosed new ST segment depressions in the inferior and lateral leads.  Following intubation, the patient's SBP dropped to 80s.  She was administered approximately 500 cc NS bolus, and required Dopamine transiently.  The patient was transferred to the MICU for further management."}

Chest x-ray showed heart size within normal limits, a prominent pulmonary vasculature was noted, bilateral interstitial opacities were noted. Electrocardiogram at 8:47 A.M. showed sinus at 87 beats per minute, left axis deviation with left ventricular hypertrophy, 1 to [**Street Address(2) 1766**] elevations in V1, upsloping ST elevations in V2 and V3, no ST depressions or Qs.

Cardiac catheterization from [**2189-2-18**], had the following findings:  Left dominant system with three vessel coronary artery disease, the left main coronary artery was normal, the left anterior descending was totally occluded at the site of the previously-placed proximal stent, the ramus intermedius branch had a long tubular 80% stenosis, the left circumflex artery had a 50% proximal stenosis, the first obtuse marginal branch was totally occluded, and the second obtuse marginal branch had a 70% origin stenosis, the left posterior descending artery had a mild luminal irregularity, the right coronary artery was a small non-dominant vessel and had an 80% proximal stenosis.  Successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the proximal left anterior descending in-stent lesion, and successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting of the ramus intermedius branch.  Hemodynamic measurements performed after the coronary intervention with the patient intubated requiring intravenous inotropic support with intra-aortic balloon pump in the left femoral artery revealed elevated left-sided filling pressures.

In general, the patient is an elderly white female, sedated and intubated.  Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm, positive S1 and S2, no murmurs, gallops or rubs.  Lungs:  Bibasilar crackles.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, normal active bowel sounds. Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema, right groin PA catheter and arterial line in place, left groin intra-aortic balloon pump in place.  LABORATORY DATA:   White blood cells 14.2, hematocrit 31.8, platelets 283.  Differential:  Neutrophils 97%, lymphs 3%. Sodium 142, potassium 3.4, chloride 106, bicarbonate 24, BUN 23, creatinine 0.8, glucose 101.  INR 1.1, PTT 20.6, PT 12.7. CK at 10 A.M. on 2-18 of 46, at 2 P.M. 475, with an MB of 60 and an MB index of 12.6 and a troponin of 40.9. Urinalysis was benign.  Chest x-ray showed heart size within normal limits, a prominent pulmonary vasculature was noted, bilateral interstitial opacities were noted. Electrocardiogram at 8:47 A.M. showed sinus at 87 beats per minute, left axis deviation with left ventricular hypertrophy, 1 to Houston, AR elevations in V1, upsloping ST elevations in V2 and V3, no ST depressions or Qs. Electrocardiogram at 1:05 P.M. with decreased blood pressure showed bigeminy at 96 beats per minute, Phoenix, SD elevations in V2 and V3, 2 to New York, CO elevations in V4 and V5, ST depressions in II, III and AVF, Q waves developed in V2 through V5, with loss of R wave progression.  Cardiac catheterization from 1968-08-11, had the following findings:  Left dominant system with three vessel coronary artery disease, the left main coronary artery was normal, the left anterior descending was totally occluded at the site of the previously-placed proximal stent, the ramus intermedius branch had a long tubular 80% stenosis, the left circumflex artery had a 50% proximal stenosis, the first obtuse marginal branch was totally occluded, and the second obtuse marginal branch had a 70% origin stenosis, the left posterior descending artery had a mild luminal irregularity, the right coronary artery was a small non-dominant vessel and had an 80% proximal stenosis.  Successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the proximal left anterior descending in-stent lesion, and successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting of the ramus intermedius branch.  Hemodynamic measurements performed after the coronary intervention with the patient intubated requiring intravenous inotropic support with intra-aortic balloon pump in the left femoral artery revealed elevated left-sided filling pressures.  The wedge pressure was 21 mm Hg.  The cardiac index was marginally decreased at 2.1.  As above, an intra-aortic balloon pump was introduced into the left femoral artery.  IMPRESSION:   82-year-old female with previous coronary artery disease status post recent left anterior descending stent, Class II congestive heart failure, hypertension, history of recent gastrointestinal bleed, presents with acute ST elevation, anteroseptal and anterior wall myocardial infarction.  Taken to the catheterization laboratory for intervention and admitted to the Coronary Care Unit, intubated, with an intra-aortic balloon pump in place, as well as on a dopamine drip secondary to hypotension."}
