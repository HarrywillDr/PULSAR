Your task is to summarise a patient conversation into a clinical note. Stick to the following rules:
1. While the conversation is colloquial, the medical note should be professional.
2. Make sure to include all relevant information from the conversation, use jargon and abbreviations where relevant.
3. If any lay man terms appear in the conversation, paraphrase them to medical terms For example,  "lower back pain" can be paraphrased to "LBP" and "Diabetes" to "Type 2 DM"
