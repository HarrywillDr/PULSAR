"[doctor]: hi there! how are you feeling today?
[patient]: hi, doctor. i'm doing okay, thanks for asking.
[doctor]: so, i went through your medical history and recent test results, and it looks like your axial back pain has improved, but not completely gone away. unfortunately, at this time, there is no surgery that could be beneficial for your lumbar internal disc disruption. however, i do have a plan to help alleviate your pain. 
[patient]: okay, what's the plan?
[doctor]: i am going to fit you with a low profile back brace, which should help support your back and reduce pain. additionally, i am starting you on diclofenac 75 mg taken orally twice daily. this medication should help with inflammation and reduce your pain levels.
[patient]: alright, sounds good. 
[doctor]: great! we'll follow up with you in a month to see how you're doing on the medication and with the back brace. in the meantime, please avoid any activities that may exacerbate your pain. if you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to me. 
[patient]: will do, thank you, doctor.","[doctor]: hi there! how are you feeling today?

"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, i’m fine, thank you.
[doctor] so according to your medical records, you’ve been experiencing tremors since the fifth grade. can you tell me more about it?
[patient] yes, it started in my right hand and then later on in my early 20s i was put on propranolol for the tremors. more recently, in the last 10 years, i’ve been taking primidone and clonazepam. clonazepam has been very helpful in reducing my anxiety and stress, which in turn helps with the tremors. i still have trouble with writing due to the tremors, but other activities of daily living are manageable.
[doctor] i see. you also mentioned that you have a head tremor, mainly ""no-no"" and occasional voice tremor as well. is that still occurring?
[patient] yes, it started around 6-7 years ago and it’s still happening.
[doctor] alright, i can see from your medical history that you’ve also been diagnosed with migraine headaches without aura and stress incontinence. how are you managing those symptoms?
[patient] the migraine headaches are far and few apart so i’m not taking any medication for them. as for stress incontinence, i haven’t been taking any medication for that either.
[doctor] okay. have you had any recent mri scans?
[patient] no, my last mri scan was done in 2001, which was normal.
[doctor] alright. based on your physical examination, i’ve diagnosed you with essential tremor and mild torticollis. it seems that the tremors are manageable for most activities of daily living, but your writing is illegible. would you like to try any new medication for the tremors or stick to your current medication?
[patient] i’d like to stick to my current medication for now.
[doctor] okay, that’s perfectly fine. we will still check your mri scan and schedule another appointment in three months. we could also offer you botox for the mild torticollis, would you like to try that?
[patient] no, i think i’ll pass on that for now.
[doctor] alright, sounds good. if you have any questions, feel free to ask me now or at your next appointment.
[patient] thank you, i don’t have any questions right now.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?

"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling now?
[patient] hi doc, i'm feeling much better. the rash has started to fade and the itching is reduced.
[doctor] that's good to hear. so, you woke up this morning with an itchy rash all over your torso and arms. do you have any idea what could have triggered this reaction?
[patient] no, i have no idea. there have been no changes in my food, medications or other exposures as far as i know. but a couple of days ago, i was removing some insulation while working.
[doctor] hmm, i see. have you had any similar allergic reactions in the past?
[patient] no, this is the first time i'm experiencing something like this.
[doctor] alright, i see. during the exam, we found that you had an acute allergic reaction with urticaria and pruritus. we gave you epinephrine and benadryl which helped reduce the symptoms. but it's difficult to identify the underlying cause of the reaction. you'll have to go back home and check if there are any changes that could have caused this reaction. meanwhile, you can manage it with over-the-counter antihistamines. if you develop any respiratory issues, shortness of breath, wheezing, or swelling of your tongue or lips, immediately come back for evaluation. 
[patient] okay, i understand. thank you, doctor. 
[doctor] you're welcome. take care and stay safe.","[doctor] hey, how are you feeling now?

[doctor] i see. and you also mentioned that you have a history of chronic pain. can you tell me more about that?
[patient] yeah, i've had multiple injuries over the years that have left me with chronic pain. it's really hard to deal with, and i usually turn to heroin to try to ease the pain.

[patient] not recently. i used to see someone, but it's been a while.
[doctor] okay. well, let's focus on your detox from heroin for now. can you tell me when you last used?
[patient] i used earlier today, both heroin and cocaine.
[doctor] okay. and how are you feeling right now?
[patient] i feel under the influence, but no other symptoms.
[doctor] alright. let's get you started on some medications to help with the detox. i'm going to prescribe clonidine and phenergan for symptomatic relief. i've already sent the prescription to your pharmacy.

"[doctor] hi, abc. how are you today?
[patient] hi, i'm doing well.
[doctor] i see that you are here to discuss weight loss surgery. can you tell me a little bit about why you are interested in this option?
[patient] yes, i have been struggling with my weight for ten years now, and i've tried multiple weight loss programs, but nothing seems to work. i want to feel good, get healthy, and be able to exercise again. i have difficulty walking, climbing stairs, and i'm tired all the time.
[doctor] i understand. can you tell me a little bit about your past medical history, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes?
[patient] yes, i have all three. i'm on medication for diabetes, and i have asthma, sleep apnea, and joint pain.
[doctor] okay. have you ever had any surgeries in the past?
[patient] yes, i had orthopedic or knee surgery.
[doctor] i see. how about your family history? do you have a family history of obesity, heart disease, or diabetes?
[patient] yes, i do. my family has a history of obesity and diabetes, but no one has had hypertension or stroke.
[doctor] okay. based on your medical history and current condition, i think laparoscopic roux-en-y gastric bypass could be an option for you. however, before we proceed, i have to tell you about the risks and potential complications of the surgery, such as bleeding, infection, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, leakage, and possible bowel obstruction. do you understand?
[patient] yes, i do.
[doctor] great. before we can proceed with surgery, there are a few things we need to do. you will need a letter of approval from dr. xyz, see a nutritionist and a mental health worker, get an upper endoscopy, and have another sleep study. we will also need to perform tests such as h. pylori testing, thyroid function tests, lfts, glycosylated hemoglobin, and fasting blood sugar. once we have all the results, we can submit them for insurance approval. does that sound good to you?
[patient] yes, it does. thank you.
[doctor] you're welcome. remember, this is not a quick fix, and it will require a lot of work from you. but i think it could help you achieve your goals and improve your health. let's work together to make this happen.","[doctor] hi, abc. how are you doing today?

[patient] yes, i had workup for a right adrenal lesion as well, which was found to be negative.
[doctor] alright. so, you have a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, undiagnosed copd, peripheral vascular disease, and claudication. is that correct?

"[doctor] hi there, how can i help you today?

[patient] okay.
[doctor] after reviewing your x-rays, i see that there are minimal degenerative changes but there is the suggestion of an exostosis on the superior femoral neck, which could be consistent with femoroacetabular impingement. we'll need to do an mri arthrogram to evaluate your anatomy and look for any possible labral tear. we'll schedule that as soon as possible. in the meantime, i recommend that you moderate your activities and we'll follow up with you once the mri is complete.

[patient]: well, it started as a toothache on the left lower side of my mouth and now the pain is radiating into my jaw and towards my left ear, uh.
[doctor]: okay, have you seen a dentist for this toothache?
[patient]: no, not since it began. i don't think it's my tooth because i have regular dental appointments, uh.
[doctor]: got it. did you notice any facial swelling or any difficulty swallowing liquids or solids?
[patient]: nope, i didn't have any of those symptoms.
[doctor]: okay, i'm going to do a physical examination to check what's going on. is that okay with you?
[patient]: sure thing, uh.
[doctor]: great. i'm going to check your vital signs first. your blood pressure is a little high, but everything else looks normal. now, let me take a look at your mouth.
[patient]: okay, uh.
[doctor]: i see that you have a dental fracture at tooth #18, which is an ellis type ii fracture. the gums look normal, but there is slight tenderness around the tooth. your oropharynx looks normal without any sign of infection. i don't see any swelling or tenderness in your neck either.
[patient]: oh, okay, uh.
[doctor]: i'm going to prescribe motrin 400 mg every 6 hours as needed for your pain. if you have any breakthrough or uncontrolled pain, you can take vicodin. the vicodin might make you drowsy, so please don't drive while you're taking it. you should also follow up with your dentist, dr. x, in 3 to 5 days for reevaluation. i'm also going to give you a prescription for penicillin v just in case you develop an infection. if you have any worsening of your condition or develop any other problems or symptoms of concern, please return to the emergency room.
[patient]: okay, thank you so much, doctor.",15

[patient's mother] yes, we've tried nasal steroids but only on a p.r.n. basis, and we're not sure if it's helped at all.

"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] not too good, doctor. i've been having headaches, nausea, and dizziness again.
[doctor] i understand. i reviewed your medical history and test results. it seems like you've been experiencing these symptoms for a while now. do you recall when they started?
[patient] yes, i've had these headaches since i was 25. they became more frequent after my husband passed away in 1996. the headaches were pulsating, and i also had ""zig-zag lines"" in my vision at times.
[doctor] i see. based on your symptoms, your diagnosis is consistent with vestibular migraine. i would like to start you on a prophylactic treatment, amitriptyline, at a low dose of 10 mg.  additionally, for abortive treatment, you can take motrin at a dose of 800 mg as needed for your severe headaches. this should provide you with some relief.
[patient] okay, thank you. 
[doctor] i also went over the importance of following a migraine diet with you. remember to avoid foods that worsen your symptoms. keep track of your migraine symptoms in a diary. this will help us identify any triggering food items. i also encouraged you to exercise daily to improve your fitness and reduce migraine symptoms. do you have any questions?

[patient] it still hurts and my knee feels unstable.
[doctor] okay. i see from your medical records that you had an acl injury to the same knee in 2008. did you receive treatment for it?
[patient] yes, i had an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction by dr. x at that time, but later on, i had a revision acl reconstruction by dr. y because of laxity of the graft due to noncompliance.
[doctor] i see. how has your knee been since then?
[patient] it was fine, i had good stability until this recent injury.
[doctor] i understand. i'm going to examine your knee now. please lie down and relax.

[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that. how are you doing with your left elbow pain now?
[patient] i'm not able to move it at all. it's very tender.
[doctor] okay, we did an x-ray of your elbow and found a spiral fracture of the distal one-third of the humerus, about 13 cm in length. the proximal part looks good, but the distal part has about 6 mm of displacement. we also noticed possible nerve injuries to the radial and median nerve, possibly neurapraxia. i spoke with dr. x and he suggests we go ahead and splint your arm and he will follow up with you. at this point, it does not seem like there needs to be any surgical revision. the chance of a compartment syndrome seems low. we'll give you some medication to manage your pain and discomfort.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] we'll use a posterior splint to immobilize your fingers, hand, and wrist all the way up to your elbow. then, we'll use some extra reinforcement around the elbow so you don't move it, straighten it or break the fiberglass. we'll give you a sling as well. you'll also receive vicodin p.o. to manage your pain. we'll give you a prescription for more vicodin, but you should only take it at nighttime and take tylenol or motrin, and ice in the daytime. i'll give you the name and telephone number of dr. x whom you can follow up with. if you have any new problems, or increasing neurologic deficits in your hands, you should come back here. how does that sound?

[patient] yes, i've been having episodes of nausea and abdominal pain for the past three years. however, this morning i had severe pain with nausea and vomiting, and that's when i went to the emergency department. dr. xyz noted an incarcerated umbilical hernia and was able to reduce it, which relieved my pain.

[doctor] we did some diagnostic studies as well. your ekg showed normal sinus rhythm with prolonged qt. your chest x-ray was negative, and your abdominal x-rays were read as being negative. your electrolytes were normal, and your creatinine was 0.9. your white count was 6.5, hematocrit was 48, and platelet count was 307. based on all of this, i'm recommending a definitive repair for your incarcerated umbilical hernia with mesh. does that sound good to you?
[patient] yes, that sounds fine.
[doctor] alright, we'll go ahead and schedule that for you. is there anything else you'd like to discuss or have any questions?
[patient] no, i think that's all for now. thank you, doctor.
[doctor] you're welcome. we'll make sure to take good care of you during your stay here.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] um, hi, i'm doing okay.
[doctor] i see that you were admitted for an incarcerated umbilical hernia. can you tell me a bit more about your symptoms?
[patient] yeah, um, i've been having episodes of nausea and abdominal pain for the past three years. however, this morning i had severe pain with nausea and vomiting, and that's when i went to the emergency department. dr. xyz noted an incarcerated umbilical hernia and was able to reduce it, which relieved my pain.
[doctor] mm-hmm, i see. do you have any significant medical history that i should be aware of?
[patient] um, the only significant history i have is a hemorrhoidectomy. i do have a history of depression and hypertension, though.
[doctor] okay, and what medications do you take?
[patient] um, i take ziac and remeron.
[doctor] do you have any allergies?
[patient] no, i don't.
[doctor] alright, thank you. and is there any history of cancer in your family?
[patient] no, there isn't.
[doctor] can you tell me about your social history? do you drink or smoke?
[patient] um, yes, i drink about 4-8 beers per night and smoke half a pack per day for 30 years. i work in electronic assembly for harmony music and have no history of hepatitis or blood transfusions.

"[doctor] hello there, how are you doing today?
[patient] hi, i'm okay, thank you.
[doctor] so, i understand you've been having some congestion and some redness on your right great toe. can you tell me a little more about that?
[patient] sure. i went to the allergist and they said i don't have any allergies, so i stopped taking my allegra, but i'm still really congested and i snort a lot. also, my right great toe has been red and peeling for about a week and a half.
[doctor] okay, i see. have you been experiencing any other symptoms?
[patient] no, just the congestion and the toe.
[doctor] alright. let me take a look at that toe if you don't mind.
[patient] sure.
[doctor] i see some redness on the lateral side of your right great toe. it looks like it might be an ingrown toenail. does it hurt when i touch it?
[patient] a little bit, yes.
[doctor] okay. i will recommend putting some neosporin on it and letting the toenail grow out a little longer. if there are any problems, please let me know.
[patient] okay, thank you.
[doctor] for your congestion, i will refer you to an ent specialist to evaluate your congestion and see if there is any issue with your adenoids or anatomy. i have already set an appointment with dr. xyz in a couple of days.

"[doctor] hi there, how are you and your little one doing today?
[patient] we are doing well, thank you.
[doctor] great to hear. so, i see that your child has a history of chronic otitis media and adenoid hypertrophy. can you tell me more about his symptoms?
[patient] yes, he has had persistent bouts of ear infections and has been having trouble breathing through his nose.
[doctor] i see. during my examination, i found that there is effusion present bilaterally in his middle ear and his tonsils were 2-3+. due to these findings, i recommend that your child undergoes adenoidectomy and bilateral myringotomy with insertion of pe tubes.
[patient] okay, what does that involve?
[doctor] adenoidectomy is the removal of the adenoids, which are located in the back of the nasal cavity and can become enlarged, causing breathing difficulties. myringotomy involves making a small incision in the eardrum to relieve pressure from fluid buildup and to insert a small tube to help with drainage. the procedure is done under general anesthesia and is typically done on an outpatient basis.
[patient] is there anything we need to do to prepare for the procedure?
[doctor] your child cannot eat or drink anything for a certain period of time before the procedure, so i will give you specific instructions on that. additionally, we will need to ensure that there are no infections present before the procedure, so we will likely conduct some tests.
[patient] okay, that makes sense. is there anything we should expect after the procedure?
[doctor] you can expect some discomfort and some drainage from the ears for a few days after the procedure. we will provide pain management and instructions on how to care for the tubes. we will also schedule a follow-up appointment to ensure that the tubes are functioning properly and that your child's symptoms have improved.
[patient] okay, thank you for explaining everything to us.
[doctor] of course, it's important to us that you understand the procedure and feel comfortable with it. if you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to ask.","[doctor] hi there, how are you and your little one doing today?

"[doctor] hi there. how are you feeling today?
[patient] hello doctor, i'm feeling a bit nervous about the surgery.
[doctor] understandable. let's go over your medical history and current situation to make sure you are prepared. so, you were diagnosed with a gleason score 8 adenocarcinoma of the prostate involving the left and right lobes. correct?
[patient] yes, that's correct.
[doctor] and you have undergone evaluation with a bone scan that showed a right parietal lesion uptake and a prostascint scan that was negative for any metastatic disease. you are now being admitted to undergo a radical prostatectomy, correct?

[patient] yes, i've had it for the last 6 years and was being followed by another rheumatologist. i've been on and off prednisone and arava, but my previous rheumatologist didn't want me on a long-term medicine.

[patient] currently, i have no pain in any of my joints.
[doctor] that's good to hear. during the physical exam, i noticed swelling in your bilateral wrists but no significant tenderness.

[patient] hey, um, i'm doing okay. i've been on crutches since the injury and there's still some swelling.
[doctor] mm-hmm, i can see some mild swelling in your right ankle and hindfoot. can you tell me more about your pain?
[patient] well, i didn't have any pain before the injury, but it's not too bad now.
[doctor] that's good to hear. so, i've gone through your medical history and physical examination, and it looks like your best option is for operative fixation. we went over the potential risks, benefits, and alternatives to both operative and nonoperative treatment. do you have any questions about the procedure?
[patient] uh, no, not really. what will the recovery process look like?

[patient] no, not really.
[doctor] okay. besides your abdomen and nosebleeds, have you noticed any other symptoms like fever or weight loss?
[patient] no, not really.
[doctor] alright. i did a physical examination, and i noticed that your abdomen is distended. i also ordered some lab tests, and they showed that your blood urea and creatinine are elevated. this tells me that you have acute on chronic renal insufficiency.
[patient] what does that mean?
[doctor] it means that your kidneys are not functioning as well as they should be. we need to do some more tests to find out what's causing it. i suspect it could be related to your history of congestive heart failure, pulmonary nodules, and exposure to asbestos. we'll need to do some more tests to rule out other possibilities as well.
[patient] what kind of tests?
[doctor] we'll start with a renal ultrasound, urine tests, and some blood tests to check for protein, creatinine, and other markers. we'll also need to check your psa level and possibly consult with a urologist if needed. does that sound okay?

[doctor] i am sorry to hear that. i read your medical history and tried treatments. how has your pain been lately?
[patient] it's been a constant pain, and it gets worse when i am standing or walking for long periods of time. i rated my pain today as 6/10.

[patient] yes, i am willing to try anything that might help me.
[doctor] great. i am prescribing you 150 mg of lyrica. you will start taking it at bedtime. make sure to follow the up-taper schedule and take it for some time before we can decide its effectiveness. if this medication doesn't work, we can consider a spinal cord stimulator trial. call me if you have any issues with the new medication, and i will see you in four weeks to re-evaluate.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?

[patient] hi, we're doing okay, thanks.

[patient] yes, that's correct.
[doctor] okay, well let's take a look. i see that you have a family history of kyphosis, is that correct?
[patient] yes, my aunt and grandfather both have it.
[doctor] okay, and your parents mentioned that you have a round back posture. have you been experiencing any pain in your back or any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your upper or lower extremities?
[patient] no, i haven't had any of those symptoms.
[doctor] good to hear. now, i see that you're interested in basketball. have you noticed any difficulties with your back posture during practice or games?
[patient] no, not really.
[doctor] alright. i'm going to give you a quick physical exam now. you're in no acute distress and you have good muscle strength in all groups. your skin is intact and there's no evidence of paraspinal muscle spasm. on forward bending, there is a mild kyphosis. i'm also seeing on your x-rays that you have approximately 46 degrees of kyphosis.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] based on your exam and x-rays, i'm diagnosing you with kyphosis. however, i want to reassure you that your kyphosis is quite mild, and it's normal for adolescents to have some degree of kyphosis. at this time, there are a few options we can discuss with your parents.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] the first option is observation. you may benefit from continued observation along with physical therapy to help with extension based strengthening exercises, flexibility range of motion exercises, and postural training with no forward bending. the second option is bracing, which would be more aggressive. however, i think we should observe your condition for now and re-evaluate in three months' time with another set of x-rays to monitor any progression. does that sound okay to you?
[patient] yes, that sounds good.
[doctor] great. i'm going to give you a prescription for physical therapy, and we will see you back in three months' time for repeat radiographs. if there is any evidence of continued progression of your kyphotic deformity, we will discuss the option of bracing at that time. do you have any questions?

"[doctor]: hello, how are you feeling today?
[patient]: hi, i'm in a lot of pain. my left leg is really hurting me.
[doctor]: i understand. so, i reviewed your x-rays and it seems like you have a fracture in your left hip. it's possible that it's a pathological fracture, which means it could be related to your history of melanoma. i would like to order a bone scan and some additional x-rays to get a better picture of what's going on.
[patient]: okay, what does that entail?
[doctor]: the bone scan involves the injection of a small amount of radioactive material into your bloodstream, which will help us to see any areas of increased bone activity. the x-rays will be of your pelvis, femur, and hip including knee. we will also consult with an oncologist to get their input.
[patient]: okay, i understand. what does this mean for me in terms of treatment?
[doctor]: based on the location and extent of the fracture, we will need to perform surgery. we will either do a left hip hemiarthroplasty or a calcar hemiarthroplasty, both of which involve replacing the broken bone with an artificial implant. i want to make you aware of the risks and benefits of these procedures, which include bleeding, infection, nerve injury, dislocation, persistent pain, leg length discrepancy, and more. we will go over these in more detail once we have a better understanding of the extent of the injury.
[patient]: okay, i appreciate you explaining everything to me. what happens next?
[doctor]: we will schedule the bone scan and x-rays, and i will consult with the oncologist. once we have all the information, we will discuss the treatment plan with you in more detail. in the meantime, i will prescribe pain medication to help manage your discomfort. is there anything else you would like to ask or discuss?

[doctor] i am dr. x, and i will be discussing your medical history, current condition and treatment plan. you were referred to me for cervical spondylosis, and i have personally reviewed your medical records and mri scans. based on my examination and review, it seems that you have a large herniated disc at c6-c7 and mild cord compression, and a smaller disc at c3-c4. this is causing the tingling sensation and some loss of sensation in your limbs that you have been experiencing.
[patient] yes, that is correct.
[doctor] i want to emphasize that this condition could lead to progressive symptoms, and if there is trauma to your neck, it could cause more severe paralysis. i strongly recommend that you follow up with me for surgical evaluation as soon as possible.

[doctor] i understand your concerns, but surgery is the best option for this condition. by wearing a hard collar while driving and avoiding vigorous workouts, you might manage your symptoms to some extent, but this will not cure the underlying condition. please do not worry, we will provide you with all the necessary information and support to make an informed decision about your treatment.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?

[patient] okay, thank you.","[doctor] um, just to let you know, we'll be providing you with a gown and socks for your stay. do you have any questions or concerns about the testing or hospital stay? 
[patient] mm-hmm, i'm a bit nervous about the diagnostic procedure. is it painful? 
[doctor] uh, there may be some discomfort, but we'll make sure to give you pain medication to help. we'll also explain the procedure in more detail before we do it so that you know what to expect.",11
"[doctor] hi there! how are you feeling today?
[patient] hello doctor. i am doing fine.
[doctor] good to know that. so, i see that you have a long history of hypertension. can you tell me about your recent blood pressure readings?
[patient] yes, my blood pressure has worsened lately despite being stable for the past 12-15 years on 10 mg of lisinopril. in august of 2007, my blood pressure started to go up to over 200s and my lisinopril was increased to 40 mg daily.
[doctor] i see. and have you experienced any physical complaints or discomfort recently?
[patient] no, i haven't felt any discomfort as of now.
[doctor] that's good. let me check your blood pressure today. okay, your blood pressure today is 182/78. your medical history also shows that you have undergone treatment for anemia with procrit. do you have any renal problems?
[patient] no, i don't have any renal problems in the past.
[doctor] alright. your lab results show 1+ proteinuria and a possible renal artery stenosis. but, mra of the renal arteries was essentially unremarkable with no suspicion for renal artery stenosis. so, i could only blame procrit initiation, as well as possible fluid retention as a cause of your accelerated hypertension. to address this, i will continue the hydrochlorothiazide at 24 mg daily and will give you a sample of tekturna, which i hope will improve your systolic blood pressure. you will report to me in 10 days with the result of your blood pressure. you will also repeat an sma7 to rule out possible hyperkalemia due to tekturna. and, don't forget to stick to your salt intake.

[patient] yes, there's a history of diabetes and cancer.

"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, i'm feeling good, thank you.
[doctor] that's great to hear. i understand that you are interested in breast reconstruction post mastectomy?
[patient] yes, that's correct.
[doctor] okay, let's talk about your options for reconstruction. we can either do an autologous tissue reconstruction, such as a tram flap, or an implant reconstruction. based on your physical size and breast morphology, i would recommend a tram flap reconstruction for a better result. however, i must warn you that there are some risks associated with this procedure, such as infection, bleeding, scarring, hernia, or bulging of the donor site, seroma of the abdomen, and fat necrosis or even the skin slough in the abdomen. are you aware of these risks?
[patient] yes, i understand the risks and i still prefer the tram flap reconstruction.
[doctor] okay, that's good to know. we will plan to do it as an immediate reconstruction at the time of your mastectomy. however, if the chance of postoperative irradiation is high, we may need to defer the reconstruction. i will coordinate with dr. abc and your oncologist to ensure that we make the best decision for your case. in the meantime, we will do an initial vascular delay procedure within the next couple of days to prepare for the reconstruction. do you have any questions or concerns?
[patient] no, i don't have any questions or concerns at the moment. thank you for explaining everything to me.
[doctor] you're welcome. if you have any further questions, don't hesitate to ask.","[doctor] hey, how's it going? feeling good today?
[patient] um, yeah, i'm doing alright. thanks for asking.
[doctor] awesome. so, i heard you're interested in breast reconstruction after your mastectomy. is that right?
[patient] yeah, that's correct.
[doctor] alrighty, let's chat options. we could go for an autologous tissue reconstruction like a tram flap, or an implant reconstruction. based on your size and breast shape, i'm thinking a tram flap would be the better choice for you. however, i gotta give you the heads up that there are some risks involved, like infection, bleeding, scarring, hernia, or bulging of the donor site, seroma of the abdomen, and fat necrosis or even the skin slough in the abdomen. have you heard about these?
[patient] mm-hmm, yeah, i know about the risks. but i still think the tram flap is the way to go for me.
[doctor] alrighty, sounds good. we'll plan for an immediate reconstruction after your mastectomy. but if we think there might be a high chance of postoperative irradiation, we might have to hold off on the reconstruction. i'll chat with dr. abc and your oncologist to make the best call for your case. in the meantime, we'll get you set up with an initial vascular delay procedure in the next couple of days to prep for the reconstruction. any questions or concerns for me?

[doctor] that's good. i also see that you had an mri scan of your cervical and lumbar spine, which showed evidence of disc bulging and herniation. i would like to perform an emg study on your right upper and right lower extremity in two weeks' time to rule out any nerve root irritation versus any peripheral nerve entrapment or plexopathy as the cause of your symptoms. additionally, i noticed some trigger points in your right trapezius and right cervical and lumbar paraspinal musculature, which suggest myofascitis. therefore, we will start a series of trigger point injections at your next follow-up visit in two weeks. in the meantime, i encourage you to continue your ongoing treatment program under your regular doctor's care and supervision. is there anything else that you would like to discuss with me?
[patient] no, i think that's all. thank you, doctor.

"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hello, i'm good, thank you.
[doctor] so, i see here that you're having pain and discomfort associated with a recurrent bunion deformity on your right foot and pain localized to the second toe and mtp joint of the right foot as well. how long have you been experiencing these symptoms?
[patient] it's been slowly recurring since my original surgery that was done around 13 years ago.
[doctor] okay, i see. and you've also noticed progressive deformity in the lesser toes of both feet. is that correct?
[patient] yes, that's right.
[doctor] i understand that you work on your feet as a hospital employee. are you experiencing any difficulty with your work?
[patient] i wear a functional orthotic that provides some relief of forefoot pain, but not completely.
[doctor] i see. well, i've reviewed your medical history and conducted a physical examination. based on that, i can say that you have a recurrence of bunion deformity on both great toes and a mild claw-toe deformity of the second and third toes to the left foot, and to a lesser degree, the second toe to the right. you also have pes planovalgus deformity in both feet.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] we've also taken x-rays today and the results show that you would require an open wedge osteotomy to reduce the intermetatarsal angle and a decompression osteotomy at the second metatarsal.
[patient] i understand.
[doctor] we did review all the remaining treatment options, including conservative versus surgical treatment. the surgery would require a period of healing and there may be potential risks and complications involved. you would also probably require surgery on your left foot at a later date. do you have any questions or concerns about the treatment plan?
[patient] no, i don't think so.
[doctor] alright. please explore your ability to take some time off from work for the period of healing and get in touch with us regarding scheduling at a later date.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?

[patient] hi, i injured my shoulder while transferring a patient back in 2002. i've had a long course of treatment including physical therapy and surgery, but the pain persists.
[doctor] i see. have you had any other health problems or injuries in the past?
[patient] no, aside from this shoulder pain, i haven't had any chronic health problems or injuries.
[doctor] alright. during the physical examination, i noticed some decreased motion in your right shoulder and a positive impingement sign. based on your history and examination, i believe you have right shoulder impingement syndrome and right suprascapular neuropathy. 
[patient] okay.
[doctor] i would recommend an impairment rating based on ama guide to the evaluation of permanent impairment, fifth edition. with a reasonable degree of medical certainty, you have a 5% whole person impairment due to the lack of motion in your shoulder and weakness in the suprascapular nerve root distribution.
[patient] okay, thank you. what are my treatment options?
[doctor] at this point, i recommend further physical therapy and possibly a corticosteroid injection to help manage the pain. it's important to keep the shoulder moving to prevent further stiffness.","[doctor] hi, can you tell me a bit about your shoulder pain?

[patient] no, i'm not having any of those symptoms.
[doctor] okay. i see that the only issue you're having is musculoskeletal pain in your right buttock, which you believe is originating from your spine. is that correct?
[patient] yes, that's correct. i don't have any history of extremity pain.
[doctor] alright, got it. can you give me an idea of the pain level on a scale of 1-10?
[patient] um, it's about a 6 or 7.

[doctor] i see. however, your pcp has made it clear that they aren't willing to prescribe you opiates for chronic back pain. it's important to follow up with the pain clinic as suggested by another physician to discuss other alternatives.
[patient] i didn't follow up with the pain clinic because i was feeling better at the time.
[doctor] i understand, but it's important to consider other options now so that you have somewhere to turn on a bad day. it's possible to use opiates for short-term pain relief, but it's not wise to rely on them long-term. instead, we can try a different anti-inflammatory medication if you feel that celebrex isn't helping. how do you feel about that?
[patient] i'm willing to try it.
[doctor] great. i'm going to prescribe you voltaren 75 mg tablets to take every 12 hours for pain relief. you can also continue with your other medications as directed, but it's important not to restart methadone or darvocet. if you're still experiencing pain after this week, please follow up with dr. y.

[doctor] so, i see that you punched a wall three days ago which caused pain in your right hand. can you tell me a little more about it?
[patient] yes, i went to the emergency room and they pushed some joints in my hand back in place. since then, i've been wearing a splint and the pain has been minimal.
[doctor] that's good to hear. do you have any numbness or tingling in your hand?
[patient] no, i don't have any numbness or tingling, just some swelling and tenderness over the ulnar dorsum of my hand.
[doctor] i see. on physical examination, i can see that there is some swelling and tenderness in that area. i also reviewed the x-ray and it appears that there might be small fractures of the base of the fourth and third metacarpals. there is also a dislocation of the third and fourth metacarpals. 
[patient] oh, okay.
[doctor] yes, we will place you in a short-arm cast and intrinsic plus for two weeks. after that, we will transition you to an ot splint and begin range of motion activities of the fingers and wrist. we should see you back in two weeks' time, and then obtain three views of your right hand and a 45-degree oblique view without the cast.

[patient] hi, i'm having left knee pain.
[doctor] okay, can you tell me a little bit more about the pain? when did it start and what makes it better or worse?
[patient] i got a third synvisc injection five days ago and the pain is still there. i feel pinching pain when i put weight on it and when it is in flexion. i have decreased range of motion with extension and i rate the pain as 10/10. i use ice and heat alternatively and take tylenol no. 3 and ibuprofen but they don't help much.
[doctor] okay, i see. any history of allergies or medical conditions i should be aware of?

[doctor] got it. how about your general health? any recent changes in weight or new symptoms?
[patient] i'm starting the medifast diet and have discussed it with my primary care physician. other than that, i don't have any new symptoms.
[doctor] okay, let's take a look at your knee. i'm going to do a physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. i see that your left knee has well-healed portholes and some medial joint line swelling. you have significant pain when i palpate the medial joint line and a positive patellar grind test. your range of motion is around -5 degrees to 95 degrees of flexion, and you have extreme hyperextension on the right with 95+ degrees of flexion on the right. you also have a click with mcmurray and negative anterior-posterior drawer. i recommend you work on weight reduction, start formal physical therapy, and a home exercise program. i'll give you refills on tylenol no. 3, flector patch, and relafen not to be taken with any other anti-inflammatory. i see you're experiencing abdominal discomfort with the anti-inflammatories, so i'm prescribing nexium 20 mg one p.o. daily. if you don't get any relief with these treatments, we'll discuss with dr. x whether you would benefit from another knee arthroscopy. follow up with me in four weeks. does this sound good to you?

[doctor] great! have you had any recent illnesses or injuries to other parts of your body?
[patient] nope, everything else is fine.
[doctor] alright, i see that you have a 4-mm laceration on the top of your right foot. but, there's no active bleeding and no exposed deeper tissues, tendons, or bones. you may have nicked a small varicose vein which caused the bleeding. i'm going to apply some antibiotic ointment and a bandage to your foot.
[patient] alright, thanks.
[doctor] no problem! so, please follow the wound care instructions that i'll give you. and, if you notice any signs of infection, please come back to the emergency room. also, there's a possibility that a small piece of glass is retained in your foot, so be careful. if you experience any pain or discomfort, you can take over-the-counter pain medication for relief. do you have any questions?

[doctor] i see. you also mentioned you've been having a bit more fatigue recently. have you noticed any pulmonary limitations to your activity?
[patient] for the most part, no.
[doctor] alright, let's take a look at your medications. you're currently taking synthroid, prilosec, plaquenil, imuran, advair, premarin, lipitor, actonel, and aspirin. have you been experiencing any adverse reactions to these medications?
[patient] no, nothing out of the ordinary.
[doctor] that's good to hear. i also noticed that you discontinued prednisone on june 16th. do you think the increasing back and joint pain may be related to this?
[patient] it's possible, but it may also be related to my lupus.
[doctor] i understand. during the physical exam, i noticed decreased breath sounds but nothing significant. your chest x-ray showed mild increased interstitial markings consistent with a history of lupus pneumonitis. we'll need to recheck your pulmonary function test and cat scan in about four to five months to see if there are any changes. at that point, we can consider weaning you off imuran if your pulmonary status is stable and your lupus appears to be under control. in the meantime, i recommend continuing your current medications.

[doctor] that's good to hear. have you been drinking anything?
[patient] yes, i have been drinking pedialyte, gatorade, white grape juice, and 7up.
[doctor] alright. so, i examined you, and i did not find anything serious. you have a viral gastroenteritis, which is common with diarrhea and vomiting. you also have some small rashes on your buttock, but it's not a serious concern. i would recommend you to stop drinking juice and stick to gatorade and water. you should avoid milk products until your diarrhea and stomach upset have calmed down. have you heard of the brat diet?
[patient] no, what is it?
[doctor] it stands for bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast. it's a diet that's easy on the stomach and helps with diarrhea. you should slowly advance your diet as you can tolerate it. your parents have used kaopectate, but it didn't help with the diarrhea. if you need any further assistance, you can come back to me.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?

[patient] well, i have had blurred vision for the past few days.

[patient] no, i don't remember anything.
[doctor] alright. i performed a physical examination and found that your neurological exam is normal, except for some mild impairment of recent memory and a slight flattening of the left nasolabial fold. you also have atrial fibrillation. based on your age and the fact that you have chronic atrial fibrillation, i suspect that you most likely had an embolic phenomenon as the cause of your tias.

[doctor] okay, and have you had any other symptoms like sweating, nausea, vomiting, or shortness of breath?
[patient] no, i haven't had any of those symptoms.
[doctor] alright, well we ran some tests and found that you have hyperthyroidism. your tsh is very low and your free t4 is high. this could be the cause of your symptoms. we gave you isosorbide mononitrate and iv steroids in the er, but we need to do more to treat your hyperthyroidism.
[patient] okay, what is the next step?
[doctor] we did an i-123 thyroid uptake scan and found that your thyroid uptake is very high, which confirms the diagnosis of graves' disease. we recommend radioactive iodine 131 ablation therapy to treat your hyperthyroidism.
[patient] will there be any side effects from this treatment?
[doctor] there is a risk of hypothyroidism, so we will need to monitor your thyroid function regularly. you should also avoid contact with your baby for the next week and stop breastfeeding.
[patient] mm-hmm, okay, i understand.
[doctor] we also noticed that you have exophthalmos and could not close your lids completely. we will need to monitor your ocular health and have you follow up with the ophthalmology clinic in 6 weeks.
[patient] alright, and what about my chest pain and tachycardia?
[doctor] we will manage your cardiac symptoms with propranolol. you will be discharged on propranolol 60mg, one tablet twice daily. you should continue taking your citalopram for depression as well. do you have any questions?
[patient] no, i think i understand everything. thank you for explaining everything to me.
[doctor] of course, it's my pleasure to help. we will also provide you with an oral contraceptive to prevent pregnancy for one year post i-131 therapy. you should use 2 forms of birth control. you will need to come back to the endocrine clinic in 6 weeks to have your thyroid function tests performed, and we will continue to monitor your thyroid function at 6-12 month intervals.",8

[patient] yes, that's still true.
[doctor] good to know. let me take a look at your physical exam and laboratory studies. okay, your heart tones are regular, but your breath sounds are greatly diminished with rales and rhonchi over all lung fields. in terms of lab results, your sodium and potassium levels are within normal limits, but your bun and creatinine are elevated. your hemoglobin and hematocrit are also low.
[patient] is that bad?
[doctor] it's not ideal, but we'll keep an eye on it. we started you on intravenous antibiotics, vigorous respiratory therapy, and intravenous solu-medrol, and it worked well. you responded well to the treatment, and your oxygenation improved, so we're going to discharge you with the following medications: prednisone 20 mg 3 times a day for 2 days, 2 times a day for 5 days and then one daily, keflex 500 mg 3 times a day. you can also be given a pneumococcal vaccination before discharge. you should follow up with me in the office in 4-5 days. does that sound good?

[doctor] i understand. i will give you a refill of percocet for the continued occasional pain, but this will be the last refill. if you have continued pain after you finish this bottle, then you can start taking ibuprofen or tylenol.
[patient] okay, i understand.
[doctor] you also had some questions about your diet. i discussed with you the brat diet consisting of foods that would slow down the digestive tract, such as bananas, rice, toast, cheese, and peanut butter. i advised you to monitor your ileostomy output and to avoid soft drinks and fruit juices. this diet is a trial and error, and you will have to perform some trials over the next few months until you find what foods you can and cannot eat with your ileostomy.

[patient] no, i have not.
[doctor] okay. based on my assessment, i believe that you are experiencing septal irritation. at this time, i would like to counsel you on the risks and benefits of surgery. if you feel that the saline nasal wash and occasional bactroban to the nose is not providing relief, we can consider surgery in 3 weeks. does that sound good to you?
[patient] yes, i will continue with the saline nasal wash and bactroban and will see you in 3 weeks to discuss further options.

[doctor] yes, it is. i also discussed with you and your husband the possibility of preterm delivery as it is common with twin pregnancies. we talked about the different etiologies of preterm delivery such as preterm labor, incompetent cervix, premature rupture of the fetal membranes as well as early delivery from preeclampsia and growth restriction. we also discussed the use of serial transvaginal ultrasound to assess for early cervical change and the use of serial transabdominal ultrasound to assess for normal interval growth. we discussed the need for frequent office visits to screen for preeclampsia. if necessary, we can discuss treatment options such as cervical cerclage, bedrest, tocolytic medications, and antenatal steroids. i would recommend that you return in two weeks for further cervical assessment and assessment of fetal growth and well-being.

[doctor] awesome. i was able to access your port and aspirated 6 ml. i added 1 ml, so you now have approximately 7 ml in your band. did you have any discomfort during the procedure?
[patient] nope, i was good. 
[doctor] perfecto! based on the amount of fluid in your band, it seems like we'll need to adjust it again in two weeks. in the meantime, i would recommend avoiding snacking at night and trying to stick to regular meals. sound good to you?

[patient] i'm okay, thanks.
[doctor] great to hear. so, i have been following up with you for immune thrombocytopenia. your platelet count had fallen to 10 on 01/09/07, but with the increased dosage of prednisone, it has improved to 43 on 01/16/07. how have you been feeling since the last visit?
[patient] i have not noticed any bleeding problems, and the petechial areas on my legs have resolved.

[doctor] mm-hmm, i see. your labs show an improvement in leukocytosis, which is good. your white count is down from 20,000 to 12.5, hemoglobin is 12, hematocrit 37, and platelets 199,000. glucose is 157, bun 14, creatinine 0.6, sodium is 131, potassium is 4.0, and co2 is 31. however, your sodium levels are still low, but they are improving. i also see that you had an ultrasound of your lower extremities and it was negative for dvt. 
[patient] yes, that's right.
[doctor] based on your condition, it seems like you have a small bowel obstruction/paralytic ileus, and we need to rule out obstipation. we'll continue with less aggressive decompression and follow the surgeon's recommendation. additionally, you have pulmonary fibrosis and we'll manage that as per pulmonologist. we'll also keep you on dvt prophylaxis and gi prophylaxis to ensure your comfort. 
[patient] okay, sounds good.
[doctor] alright, let's see how you do over the next couple of days. if anything changes, please let us know.",6
"[doctor] hi there, how are you and your little one doing today?
[patient] hello, i'm doing well but i'm worried about my son. he's been having some issues with his eating habits.
[doctor] i see, can you tell me more about it?
[patient] yes, he's become a very picky eater and he's not eating very much in general. also, he's been vomiting sometimes after eating certain foods.
[doctor] i understand. what kind of foods is he vomiting after?
[patient] we noticed that he vomits after eating raw carrots and celery.
[doctor] i see. and how long after eating these foods does he start to feel pain and vomit?
[patient] it usually takes about 5 to 10 minutes before he complains that his stomach hurts and then vomits.
[doctor] i see. has this happened with any other foods?
[patient] no, he eats other foods without any apparent pain or vomiting.
[doctor] i understand. does he have any other symptoms like diarrhea or constipation?
[patient] no, his bowel movements are normal.
[doctor] i see. does he have any medical issues?
[patient] he has reactive airway disease, but he's not diagnosed with intrinsic asthma at this time and takes no medication regularly.
[doctor] i see. based on what you've told me, it doesn't seem like an allergic reaction or obstruction. at this time, i would advise you to avoid giving him raw carrots and celery. in the future, you can try giving him those foods again and see how he tolerates them. i would also encourage you to include a wide variety of fruits and vegetables in his diet. if his symptoms worsen or persist, please feel free to contact me again for reevaluation.
[patient] thank you, doctor. i will follow your advice and keep an eye on his symptoms.

[patient] okay, what's going on?
[doctor] it looks like you have rhabdomyolysis, which is the breakdown of muscle tissue. this was most likely caused by your statins, and we have discontinued those. you will need to continue receiving iv fluids, and we will monitor your condition.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] additionally, your kidney function is not at its best, and we will need to consult with a nephrologist to determine the best course of action.

[doctor] alright then, we will continue to monitor your condition closely. total critical care time spent today was 37 minutes.","[doctor] hi there, how's it going today?
[patient] um, not great, doc. i'm feeling really weak.
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that. i saw in your records you've been dealing with atrial flutter and rapid ventricular response. did dr. x fill you in on that?
[patient] uh-huh, yeah. they used esmolol to control the rate, but my blood pressure got low - like 70s low, and my map was 52.
[doctor] got it. that's not ideal. let's try some fluid to see if it helps, and if not, we can look at neo-synephrine pressure support. we've got to keep an eye on the hypotension.
[patient] okay, thanks.
[doctor] on top of that, it looks like you've got pneumonia, respiratory distress syndrome, ventilatory-dependent respiratory failure, and raised transaminases. we'll stick with the current antibiotics and keep an eye on your white blood cell count. the raised transaminases are from increased congestion. we'll monitor that closely.
[patient] gotcha.
[doctor] to help with the low blood pressure, we'll give you some extra fluids.
[patient] mm-hmm, thanks.
[doctor] any questions or concerns?
[patient] not right now, doc.
[doctor] alrighty, we'll keep a close eye on things. we spent 37 minutes in critical care today.",6
"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling?
[patient] i'm doing okay, thanks.
[doctor] i see here that you came in last week because of pain in the ball of your left foot. can you tell me more about that?
[patient] yeah, i noticed a small dark spot, but i didn't remember having any injuries to that area. i went to see dr. x and was prescribed keflex since the area was swollen. it got worse, so i was admitted to the hospital and prescribed ancef and cipro.
[doctor] i see. i also noticed that your foot has an open wound with purulent discharge and surrounding edema. is it still painful?
[patient] yes, it's still painful and tender to the touch.
[doctor] alright. i have ordered some tests to determine the cause of the abscess, including cultures, gram stain, fungal cultures, and smear. we have changed your antibiotic to vancomycin and maxipime, which should be more effective. you will be discharged soon, but make sure to follow up with your primary care physician to monitor your progress. do you have any questions?
[patient] no, i think i understand. thank you, doctor.
[doctor] no problem, take care.","[doctor] hi, how's it going?

"[doctor] hi there, how are you today?
[mother] hello, we're doing well, thank you for asking.
[doctor] of course, it's great to see you all. so, it looks like we're here for a 5-year 3-month well-child check. how has everything been going since your last visit?
[mother] yes, everything has been going well. our daughter has been healthy and doing well overall.
[doctor] that's great to hear. can you tell me a bit about her diet and eating habits?
[mother] sure, she eats a well-balanced diet with milk, dairy products, fruits, vegetables, proteins, and grains. we try to minimize her intake of junk food and snack food.
[doctor] that's great to hear. how about her behavior and social interactions?
[mother] we have no behavioral concerns. she gets along well with her peers and adults. she's also excited to start kindergarten this upcoming school year.
[doctor] wonderful. does she attend daycare?
[mother] yes, she does.
[doctor] okay. and how has she been with her voiding and stooling patterns?
[mother] normal patterns. no concerns there.
[doctor] excellent. and how about her hearing and vision?
[mother] no concerns there. she sees the dentist regularly as well.
[doctor] good to know. now, i see that our patient has passed all developmental milestones per age in areas of fine motor, gross motor, personal and social interaction, and speech and language development. that's great news. i also see that she has no allergies or medications. is that still correct?
[mother] yes, that's correct. no changes here.
[doctor] alright. and how about her home environment?
[mother] we still live at home with mother, father, and sibling. there's no smoking in the home.
[doctor] good to know. now, i'll go ahead and take her vital signs. weight is at 43 pounds, height at 42-1/4 inches, temperature at 97.7 and blood pressure at 90/64. our patient appears to be well-developed, well-nourished, cooperative, alert, and interactive with no acute distress. her head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat all appear to be normal as well. her neck and chest sound clear, and she has regular pulses with no murmur.
[patient] *giggles*
[doctor] you sound healthy! alright, moving on to the abdomen and gu areas, everything appears to be normal. no rash and full range of motion in the extremities. no scoliosis in the back, and the integument looks fine. neurological responses appear to be intact as well.
[mother] that's great news.
[doctor] yes, everything looks good. so, my assessment is that we have a well 5-year 3-month-old white female. i'll go ahead and provide some anticipatory guidance for growth, diet development, and safety issues. i'll also be administering mmr, dtap, and ipv today. i've discussed the risks and benefits with you, as well as some possible side effects and symptomatic treatments. i'll give you a 5-year well-child check handout, and we've already completed the school pre-participation physical. finally, we've reviewed the results of the vision and hearing screening with you. please follow up in one year for the next well-child check or as needed for acute care.

"[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, i am not feeling great, my right hip is causing me a lot of pain.
[doctor] okay, let me take a look at your medical notes. i see that you have a history of prior laminectomy for spinal stenosis and have seen dr. xyz with low back pain and lumbar scoliosis post laminectomy syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis, and clinical right l2 radiculopathy, which is symptomatic. dr. xyz had performed two right l2-l3 transforaminal epidural injections, last one in march 2005. is that correct?
[patient] yes, that's right.
[doctor] and you were also seen for your hip pain and dr. xyz had performed right intraarticular hip injection on 04/07/2005. she was last seen on 04/15/2005. at that time, she had the hip injection that helped her briefly with her pain. is that correct?
[patient] yes, that's right.
[doctor] i can see that you have been taking ultracet for your pain, but it's not quite taking care of it. i will prescribe tylenol #3 for you, up to four times a day. you can call for the refills when you need them. i would also recommend that you start using a cane to help you ambulate. have you seen an orthopedic surgeon yet for your hip pain?
[patient] yes, i have made an appointment to see an orthopedic surgeon in newton as it is closer and more convenient for me.

"[doctor]: hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient]: i am not doing well, doctor. i am still having pain in my low back and both knees.
[doctor]: i see. let me check your medical history. as per your medical record, you have had radiofrequency ablation for your low back pain, which has helped to some extent. you also have degenerative disc disease in both knees and pes anserinus bursitis, which is causing the pain. dr. xyz has recommended knee x-rays and sacroiliac joint injection. is that right?
[patient]: yes, that's correct. i am taking lortab and celebrex, which are providing some relief.
[doctor]: alright. let me examine you. i will check your low back and both knees for any tenderness or swelling. [after physical examination] i can see that you have some pain in your right sacroiliac joint, and both your knees are tender with pes anserinus bursitis. i suggest you go for sacroiliac joint injection and knee x-rays.
[patient]: okay, can you explain the procedure and possible complications?
[doctor]: sure, the sacroiliac joint injection is done under fluoroscopy, and it helps in reducing pain and inflammation. there are minimal risks involved, such as bleeding, infection, or nerve damage, but they are rare. knee x-rays will help us in identifying the exact cause of your pain. and for your knees, we can also do intraarticular and/or pes anserine bursa injections bilaterally. if needed, we can plan for follow-up procedures. do you have any questions?
[patient]: no, doctor. i understand everything. thank you for explaining it to me.

"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?
[patient] hi, i'm doing okay, thanks.
[doctor] good to hear. so, i took a look at your records and it looks like you've been dealing with some finger issues for several months now. can you tell me a bit more about what's been going on?
[patient] yeah, my right middle finger has been triggering and locking, and my right index finger has been sore at the pip joint.
[doctor] i see. and you've had injections in the past for this, but they didn't help?
[patient] no, unfortunately not.
[doctor] okay, well we'll take a closer look and see what we can do to help. so, i did a physical exam and found some tenderness in your right middle finger a1 pulley, and some small soreness in your right index finger. your finger flexion and extension seem to be intact, which is good. i didn't find any other issues in the rest of your arm. 
[patient] okay.
[doctor] based on what i'm seeing, it looks like you have tendinitis in your left middle finger, pip joint synovitis and mucocyst, which is controlled on nonoperative treatment, and a middle finger trigger that has failed nonoperative treatment and will require a trigger finger release to the right middle finger.
[patient] alright, what's the next step then?
[doctor] we discussed the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure, and i answered all of your questions. no guarantees can be made, of course. we'll schedule you for surgery in order to help you improve your condition. do you have any more questions?

"[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm not feeling well. my back is hurting, and the pain is radiating down my right leg.
[doctor] i see. can you tell me more about your injury?
[patient] i was working as a temporary worker unloading an 18-wheeler back in october when i felt sharp pain in my lower back while picking up boxes. since then, my pain has been persistent, and i have radiating symptoms down my right leg, worse than my left.
[doctor] i understand. have you seen any doctors for this issue?
[patient] yes, i've been to a few. i initially saw dr. z, who provided me with muscle relaxers and pain patches, but my symptoms continued. then, i was referred to dr. xyz, who prescribed short-acting opioids and performed an mri, which came back negative for radiculopathy. however, i continued to have radiating symptoms and was recommended for a nerve block, which didn't help. i also tried chiropractic care, but that didn't provide long-term relief either.

[doctor] i understand. let's do a physical examination to assess your current condition. can you sit down for me?
[patient] sure.
[doctor] i'm going to check your range of motion. lumbar flexion is moderately decreased, extension is normal, and side bending to the right is decreased. rotation and extension to the right side is causing increasing pain. straight leg is negative on the lle at 90° and also negative on the rle at 90°. let's move to the supine position. straight leg is negative in the lle and also negative on the rle. sensory exam shows there was a decrease in sensation to the s1 dermatomal distribution on the right side to light touch. deep tendon reflex at the patella was 2+/4 bilaterally, but there was a decrease in reflex in the achilles tendon 1+/4 on the right side and essentially 2+/4 on the left side. medial hamstring reflex was 2+/4 on both hamstrings as well. on prone position, there was tightness in the paraspinals and erector spinae muscle as well as tightness on the right side of the quadratus lumborum area, right side was worse than the left side. increase in pain at deep palpatory examination in midline of the l5 and s1 level.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] based on your physical examination and medical history, i diagnose you with residual from low back injury with right lumbar radicular symptomatology. i recommend you avoid prolonged walking, standing, stooping, squatting, hip bending, climbing, excessive flexion, extension, and rotation of your back. your one-time weight limit should be determined by a work trial, but you will need to be closely monitored and managed for your pain control by a specialist for management of your overall pain. you should also undergo appropriate modalities and rehabilitation in the near future. additionally, you have an impairment of 8% of the whole person, and you should be closely monitored for dependency on short-acting opioids in the near future. do you have any questions?

[patient] it's been stable except for some variation in my weight. sometimes i take my wife's lasix tablets for diuretic benefits.
[doctor] alright. we should consider adding a low-dose furosemide tablet to your medication. we need to follow up on your digoxin level and liver function tests as well. we increased your lisinopril to 5 mg daily, but we need to make sure you receive the prescription. does that sound good?

[doctor] good to hear! i was just going through your medical notes and noticed that you were recently discharged from the hospital. can you tell me how you've been feeling since then?
[patient] mm-hmm, yeah, i've been feeling okay, but i still have shortness of breath at night when i'm lying flat.
[doctor] uh-huh, i see. we need to investigate this issue further. how have you been taking your medications?
[patient] oh, i've been taking them regularly as prescribed.
[doctor] great to know! your ptu medication is for your hyperthyroidism, which you've had since 1992. we'll need to monitor your tsh and t4 levels until you become euthyroid. then, you can see dr. huffman for further treatment. how has your atrial fibrillation been?
[patient] uh, i've been taking metoprolol for rate control, and my inr levels are being monitored by the homeless clinic.
[doctor] oh, okay. you could benefit from an increase in your metoprolol dosage but we need to be cautious about lowering your heart rate in the setting of congestive cardiac failure. how has your heart failure been?
[patient] it's been stable, except for some variation in my weight. sometimes i take my wife's lasix tablets for diuretic benefits.
[doctor] uh-huh, alright. we should consider adding a low-dose furosemide tablet to your medication. we need to follow up on your digoxin level and liver function tests as well. we increased your lisinopril to 5 mg daily, but we need to make sure you receive the prescription. does that sound good?
[patient] yeah, that sounds good. thank you for your help.
[doctor] no problem! let's schedule a follow-up appointment and keep monitoring your progress.",6

"[doctor]: hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient]: i'm feeling okay, just ready to go home.
[doctor]: i understand, and you will be discharged today. i just want to go over your discharge diagnoses and instructions with you. firstly, you were diagnosed with bilateral lower extremity cellulitis which was caused by bilateral tinea pedis, prostatic hypertrophy with bladder outlet obstruction, and cerebral palsy.
[patient]: yes, i remember that.
[doctor]: okay, we will be discharging you with your usual valium of 10-20 mg at bedtime for spasticity, flomax 0.4 mg daily, cefazolin 500 mg q.i.d, and lotrimin cream to be applied between your toes twice daily for an additional two weeks. you will also need to follow up with your regular appointments.
[patient]: okay, i understand.
[doctor]: great. during your admission, we found some abnormalities in your laboratory studies. your white blood cell count was 8200, and your urine showed 4-9 red blood cells per high-powered field with 2+ bacteria. your blood culture and wound cultures were unremarkable, and the chest x-ray was normal. how have you been feeling about these results?
[patient]: i'm not too concerned, i trust that you have given me the appropriate treatment.
[doctor]: that's great to hear. during your stay, we treated you with intravenous ceftriaxone and topical lotrimin, which resolved your lower extremity edema and erythema quite rapidly. however, because of urinary frequency, we did a bladder scan which showed that you had about 600 cc of residual urine. we then inserted a foley catheter which drained approximately 500 cc of urine. we have prescribed flomax 0.4 mg daily to help with this issue. after 24 hours, we removed the foley catheter and your bladder scan showed that you had 60 cc of residual urine after eight hours.
[patient]: okay, thank you for the explanation.
[doctor]: you're welcome. at the moment, you are walking minimally, but not enough to resume independent living. i advise you to continue taking your medications and to follow up with any appointments that we have set up for you. do you have any other questions before you are discharged?

[doctor] it means that the spinal cord is abnormally attached to the surrounding tissues, which can cause symptoms such as leg pain, numbness, or weakness. to confirm this, i have recommended a repeat mri scan, which you have recently completed. we will discuss the results at your next appointment. 
[patient] okay, what would be the next steps?

[doctor] basically, it's when your spinal cord is attached abnormally to the surrounding tissues, which can cause leg pain, numbness, or weakness. we did an mri to confirm this and we'll go over the results at your next appointment. 
[patient] alright, what's next then? 
[doctor] we gotta wait for the mri results first. after that, we'll figure out the best way to tackle this. in some cases, we might need to do surgery. any questions for me? 
[patient] not right now. 
[doctor] no problem. i'll see you soon to talk about the mri results and what we're gonna do next.",5
"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?
[patient] hi, doctor. i'm not feeling well. my throat really hurts and my eyes are puffy.
[doctor] i see. has this been going on for a while?
[patient] it started last night suddenly. i took some benadryl but it's not helping much.
[doctor] okay. have you had any fever or other symptoms?
[patient] yes, i have a low-grade fever and i feel really tired.
[doctor] i understand. have you been eating and drinking normally?
[patient] yes, i've been able to eat and drink without any problems.
[doctor] that's good to hear. any coughing or shortness of breath?
[patient] no, just a hoarse voice.
[doctor] alright. let me take a look at you. can you open your mouth for me?
[patient] sure.
[doctor] your throat looks pink and moist, but i do see some drainage in the back of your throat. your ears look good, but your nose is swollen and red. have you had any sinus pain?
[patient] no, not really.
[doctor] alright. your lungs sound clear and your heart rate is normal. i'm going to do a strep test just to be sure, but it's most likely just an upper respiratory infection.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] the test came back negative, so i'm going to recommend treating your symptoms. i'll give you some samples of levall for congestion and you can take ibuprofen or tylenol for any discomfort. make sure you drink plenty of fluids and get some rest.
[patient] thank you, doctor.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?

"[doctor] hi, mr. abc. how are you doing today?
[patient] hi, doctor. i'm doing well, thanks for asking.
[doctor] good to hear. so, i see here that you're still experiencing moderate-to-severe sleep apnea. can you tell me how the cpap has been working for you?
[patient] yes, the cpap has limited my snoring at night. occasionally, my bed partner wakes me in the middle of the night when the mask comes off, and reminds me to replace it. i estimate that i use the cpap around 5 to 7 nights per week, but sometimes i take it off and do not replace the mask when i wake up at night.
[doctor] i see. and how have you been feeling in the mornings when you wake up? do you feel refreshed?
[patient] yes, i do feel relatively refreshed in the mornings. i don't toss and turn much and i don't wake up with the sheets in disarray.
[doctor] that's good to hear. i also see that you've lost some weight in the past few months. that's great progress. have you noticed any improvement in your sleep apnea symptoms since losing weight?
[patient] not really, but i've been trying to maintain my weight at the current level or below.
[doctor] that's a good goal to have. i recommend that you continue using the cpap and also make efforts to maintain your weight. we might consider re-running a sleep study if you succeed in reducing further to determine whether you still require the cpap.
[patient] okay, i'll do my best to maintain my weight. is there anything else i can do to improve my sleep apnea symptoms?
[doctor] yes, i recommend that you have a fiberoptic ent exam performed to exclude adenoidal tissue that may be contributing to obstruction. you will also be sending me your smart card for downloading to determine your cpap usage pattern. you will be returning for routine followup in 6 months. does that sound good to you?
[patient] yes, that sounds good. thank you, doctor.","[doctor] hey, mr. abc. how's it going?
[patient] oh, hi there, doctor. i'm doing pretty good. thanks for asking.
[doctor] glad to hear it. so, looks like you're still dealing with that sleep apnea. how's the cpap machine been treating you?
[patient] yeah, the cpap machine's been okay. i still snore a bit, but not as much. sometimes, my bed partner wakes me up when the mask comes off. i'd say i use it around 5-7 nights a week, but some nights i forget to put it back on if i wake up.
[doctor] gotcha. and how do you feel when you wake up in the morning? are you feeling more rested?
[patient] yeah, i feel pretty good in the morning. i don't really toss and turn anymore and the sheets are pretty much in the same place as when i fell asleep.
[doctor] that's good to hear. i also see you've lost some weight recently, which is fantastic. have you noticed any improvement in your sleep apnea symptoms?
[patient] not really, but i'm trying to keep my weight where it's at or maybe even lose more.
[doctor] good goal to have. i suggest you keep on with the cpap and try to maintain your weight. we could consider running another sleep study if you lose more weight to see if you still need the machine.
[patient] alright, i'll do my best to keep the weight off. anything else i can do to improve things?
[doctor] yes, i recommend getting a fiberoptic ent exam to check for adenoidal tissue that might be causing a blockage. also, send me your smart card so i can check your cpap usage pattern. we'll schedule another follow-up in 6 months. sound good?
[patient] sounds good, doc. thanks.",5
"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm feeling alright, thank you.
[doctor] i'm glad to hear that. so, we received the test results and the good news is that there is no active bleeding from your gastrointestinal tract. however, the tests did confirm that you have ulcerative esophagitis, which was causing the bleeding. the gastroenterologist, dr. x, recommended that we increase the dose of your proton pump inhibitor and avoid nsaids in the future. how does that sound to you?
[patient] okay, i understand.
[doctor] additionally, your cough and wheezing have improved but you are still producing yellow-brown sputum with increasing frequency. therefore, i'm going to continue your current medication and add guaifenesin and n-acetyl-cysteine to your treatment plan. this should help mobilize some of the secretions and improve your breathing. we will continue to monitor you overnight and if there are no further complications, we will transfer you back to the medical floor to continue treatment for your chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation. how does that sound to you?
[patient] that sounds good, thank you.
[doctor] there's one more thing i wanted to talk to you about. your cea levels came back elevated, indicating that you may have some issues with your colon. we recommend a colonoscopy to check for any abnormalities. it's important that we do this as early detection of any abnormality will help us to treat it more effectively. i understand that you refused the colonoscopy earlier, but i would encourage you to reconsider as it is important for your health.
[patient] okay, i'll think about it.
[doctor] great, that's all i have for you today. we will continue to monitor you and keep you updated on your progress.","[doctor] hey there, how are you feeling today?

[patient] for about three days now, and i also have this rash on my face, back, and arms which is very itchy.

"[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi doctor, i have these sores in my mouth for about 10-12 days now and it has been bothering me.
[doctor] i see. can you tell me more about your medical history? any medications or treatments that you are currently taking?
[patient] i have rheumatoid arthritis for which i have been treated with methotrexate for the past ten years. i was also taking an nsaid about a month ago that was recently continued because of the ulcerations in my mouth. i was also placed on an antibiotic for a suspected upper respiratory infection.
[doctor] i see. based on your history and physical examination, it appears that you have erosive stomatitis probably secondary to methotrexate even though the medication has been used for ten years without any problems.
[patient] okay, what do you suggest i do?
[doctor] i agree with your therapeutic regimen regarding this condition with the use of prednisone and folic acid. i also suggest that you discontinue your use of methotrexate to produce a resolution of this patients’ skin problem. however, this stomatitis may take a number of weeks to go away completely. i also suggest that you use lidex gel topically three times a day as it works extremely well in stomatitis conditions.

[doctor] so, you're here because of chest pain and possible syncopal spells?
[patient] yes, that's correct.
[doctor] can you tell me more about your symptoms?
[patient] i've been having chest pains that feel like cramps or a dull ache. also, i've had three spells of ""falling"" where i see spots before my eyes. i'm not sure if they're syncopal, but it's possible. i also feel tender in my left breast area and sometimes get numbness in my left hand.
[doctor] i see. and when do these symptoms usually occur?
[patient] the chest pain lasts all day long and the falling happened twice when i got up quickly at night and once in the grocery store.
[doctor] alright. i've reviewed your medical history and i see that you had a partial hysterectomy in january 2009. since then, you've been feeling different and stressed out due to your children's add and odd and lack of support from your husband. i suspect that the chest pain is due to musculoskeletal factors from emotional stressors. also, your ekg and echocardiogram look good, so i don't think there's a cardiac issue causing the syncopal spells. i suspect that it's simple orthostasis/vasovagal, so i've asked you to drink plenty of fluids and not get up suddenly at night. i've also prescribed flexeril to help with the chest pain. if the syncopal spells continue, we may need to do a tilt-table study.

"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling?
[patient] i'm doing okay, a bit sore, but alright.
[doctor] that's good to hear. so, as you know, we ran some tests as part of your annual physical exam and found that your prostate-specific antigen (psa) level was elevated, which led us to perform biopsy and prostatectomy. 
[patient] okay, and what were the results?
[doctor] your biopsy showed a small focus of adenocarcinoma in the left lobe, but the right lobe was negative. however, during the prostatectomy, we found moderately differentiated infiltrating adenocarcinoma gleason 3+2 which extended to the apex involving both lobes of the prostate, mainly the right.
[patient] what does that mean? 
[doctor] it means that we found cancer in your prostate gland, but it was limited to less than 5% of the tissue. we removed your prostate gland, pelvic lymph nodes, seminal vesicles, and a small portion of the bladder neck. the surgical margin was involved at the apex. however, the capsule and seminal vesicles were free. 
[patient] alright, what do i need to do now? 
[doctor] you don't need to do anything at this point. we will monitor your psa levels regularly to ensure that the cancer has not returned. your post-op psa level is 0.1 mg/ml, which is a good sign. however, you are experiencing mild urgency incontinence, which is a common side effect. we will work with you to manage this. 
[patient] okay, thank you for letting me know. 
[doctor] of course, please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any further questions or concerns.","[doctor] hey, how's it going? 
[patient] um, i'm doing alright, a little sore though.
[doctor] ah, gotcha. so, we did some tests during your annual check-up and your psa levels were a bit high. that led us to do a biopsy and prostatectomy. 
[patient] mm-hmm, and what did the results show? 
[doctor] well, the biopsy found a small area of adenocarcinoma in the left lobe, but the right was clear. but during the prostatectomy, we found moderate adenocarcinoma gleason 3+2 that spread to both lobes of the prostate, mainly the right. 
[patient] uh, what does that mean exactly? 
[doctor] it means that you have prostate cancer, but it was contained to less than 5% of the tissue. we removed your prostate, pelvic lymph nodes, seminal vesicles, and a small part of the bladder neck. the margins were involved at the apex, but the capsule and seminal vesicles were free. 
[patient] okay, what's next? 
[doctor] for now, we'll just keep an eye on your psa levels to make sure the cancer doesn't come back. your post-op psa is at 0.1 mg/ml, which is great. but you are experiencing some mild urgency incontinence, which is a common side effect. we'll help you manage that.

"[doctor] hi, how are you doing today?
[patient] i'm doing fine, thank you.
[doctor] so, we got your test results back and it looks like your psa levels are elevated. did you notice any symptoms?
[patient] no, i feel perfectly healthy.
[doctor] okay, we went ahead and did an ultrasound guided sextant biopsy of your prostate and the test revealed that you have prostate cancer.
[patient] oh no, what does that mean?
[doctor] it means that we found cancer cells in your prostate gland. we did further testing and found that the cancer is moderately differentiated, which means it's growing slower than other types of cancer.
[patient] what are my options for treatment?
[doctor] well, there are a few options. we can do surgery to remove the prostate, radiation therapy or implanting i-125 seeds that deliver low-dose radiation over time to kill the cancer cells. based on your medical history, we recommend the low dose rate interstitial prostatic implants of i-125. it's an outpatient procedure and it's been proven to be very effective. we can schedule it for you soon if you'd like?

[patient] i've been experiencing nocturia and just feeling more tired than usual.
[doctor] okay, i see. and have you noticed any changes in your urinary stream recently?
[patient] no, nothing out of the ordinary.
[doctor] alright, let me just do a quick physical exam. everything looks good except for your prostate gland.
[patient] what's wrong with it?
[doctor] during the digital rectal exam, i felt some nodularity on the right side of the gland. we ran some tests and found that your psa levels are elevated.
[patient] what does that mean?
[doctor] well, it could be suggestive of prostate cancer. we ordered some imaging tests to confirm our suspicions.
[patient] and what did the imaging tests show?
[doctor] the ct scan of your pelvis showed an irregular indentation of your bladder, and the bone scan came back negative for distant metastasis. however, the ct scan did reveal some spread of the cancer to the periprostatic plexus.
[patient] so what's the plan?
[doctor] we performed a transrectal needle biopsy of the prostate and a pelvic lymphadenectomy. unfortunately, the lymph node biopsy came back positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma, so we had to cancel the radical prostatectomy that was planned.
[patient] what's the next step then?
[doctor] we'll be starting you on external beam radiation therapy to the pelvis to target the cancer cells and hopefully slow down the spread of the cancer.

"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] hi, i'm feeling okay, a little tired but okay.
[doctor] that's good to hear. i just wanted to go over your results and see how you're doing. so, we found that you had unstable angina and congestive heart failure with impaired lv function, is that correct?
[patient] yes, that's right.
[doctor] okay. during the procedure, we performed a left heart catheterization, left ventriculogram, aortogram, and coronary angiogram. we found that your lv ejection fraction is between 10% to 15% with global hypokinesis and only the anterior wall is contracting, which means the left side of your heart is not pumping as well as it should.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] we also found that you had a mid 80% to 90% stenosis in your left anterior descending artery, and a more than 90% stenosis in your first diagonal branch. we decided to proceed with intervention on the left anterior descending artery and perform a percutaneous coronary intervention (pci) using an impella assist device. we were successful in reducing the lesions in the lad and diagonal to less than 60% and timi 3 flow was obtained. we also found that your left main coronary artery had a retrograde dissection, which we were able to successfully treat with a stent, reducing the lesion from 50% to 0% and also obtaining timi 3 flow.
[patient] i see.
[doctor] you tolerated the procedure well with no complications and the estimated blood loss was 200 ml. the estimated dye used was 200 ml of visipaque. you remained hemodynamically stable with no hypotension and no hematomas in the groins. we plan to keep you hydrated and observe you overnight for any hemodynamic instability or ischemia. if you remain stable, the right common femoral artery and vein sheaths will be removed and manual pressure will be applied for hemostasis. you will also be started on aspirin, plavix, statins, beta blockers, and ace inhibitors as tolerated. do you have any questions?
[patient] no, i think i understand. thank you for explaining it to me.
[doctor] of course, it's important that you understand your treatment plan. we will continue to monitor your progress and make any necessary adjustments.","[doctor] hi there! so how are you feeling after the procedure?

[doctor] mm-hmm, that's good to hear. so, we wanted to go over your results and see how you're doing. we found that you had unstable angina and congestive heart failure with impaired lv function, is that correct?
[patient] yup, that's right.
[doctor] okay, during the procedure, we performed a left heart catheterization, left ventriculogram, aortogram, and coronary angiogram. we found that your lv ejection fraction is between 10% to 15% with global hypokinesis and only the anterior wall is contracting, which means the left side of your heart is not pumping as well as it should.
[patient] got it, thanks.
[doctor] we also found that you had a mid 80% to 90% stenosis in your left anterior descending artery, and a more than 90% stenosis in your first diagonal branch. we decided to proceed with intervention on the left anterior descending artery and perform a percutaneous coronary intervention (pci) using an impella assist device. we were successful in reducing the lesions in the lad and diagonal to less than 60% and timi 3 flow was obtained. we also found that your left main coronary artery had a retrograde dissection, which we were able to successfully treat with a stent, reducing the lesion from 50% to 0% and also obtaining timi 3 flow.
[patient] okay, got it.
[doctor] you tolerated the procedure well with no complications and the estimated blood loss was 200 ml. the estimated dye used was 200 ml of visipaque. you remained hemodynamically stable with no hypotension and no hematomas in the groins. we plan to keep you hydrated and observe you overnight for any hemodynamic instability or ischemia. if you remain stable, the right common femoral artery and vein sheaths will be removed and manual pressure will be applied for hemostasis. you will also be started on aspirin, plavix, statins, beta blockers, and ace inhibitors as tolerated. any questions from you?
[patient] nope, i think i understand. thank you for explaining it to me. 
[doctor] absolutely! it's important that you understand your treatment plan. we will continue to monitor your progress and make any necessary adjustments.",4
"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?
[patient] i'm feeling okay, a little groggy from the procedure.
[doctor] that's understandable. i wanted to go over the findings with you. we found multiple superficial erosions and ulcers in your stomach and colon, and marked cecal involvement with large ulcers and an irregular ileocecal valve. all of these findings are consistent with crohn's disease.
[patient] crohn's disease? what is that?
[doctor] crohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of your digestive tract from your mouth to your anus. it causes inflammation and ulcers, which can lead to abdominal pain and diarrhea.
[patient] okay, what's the plan then?
[doctor] we're going to start you on prednisone to reduce the inflammation, and we're waiting on some test results before starting remicade. we also want to reverse your malnutrition with modulon and check your blood work regularly to monitor for any changes. we may need to do another ct scan or upper gi to rule out any complications, and possibly a capsule endoscopy to further evaluate any other mucosal lesions. do you have any questions?
[patient] no, i think i understand. thank you, doctor.
[doctor] of course, we'll be here to support you every step of the way.","[doctor] hey there, how's it going?
[patient] um, i'm feeling okay, just a bit groggy from the procedure.
[doctor] yeah, that makes sense. so, i wanted to talk to you about the results we found. you've got multiple superficial erosions and ulcers in your stomach and colon, as well as some marked cecal involvement with large ulcers and an irregular ileocecal valve. all of these findings are consistent with crohn's disease.
[patient] oh, uh, what's crohn's disease again?
[doctor] crohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of your digestive tract, from your mouth to your anus. it can cause inflammation and ulcers, leading to abdominal pain and diarrhea.
[patient] got it. so, what's the plan?
[doctor] well, we're going to start you on prednisone to reduce the inflammation. we're waiting on some test results before starting remicade, and we're also going to reverse your malnutrition with modulon. we'll need to check your blood work regularly to monitor for any changes, and we may need to do another ct scan or upper gi to rule out any complications. it's also possible we may need to do a capsule endoscopy to further evaluate any other mucosal lesions. do you have any questions?

"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the upper endoscopy?
[patient] i'm doing okay, a little sore in the throat, but not too bad.
[doctor] that's normal. i wanted to go over the results of the procedure with you. the good news is that we found no major issues in your upper digestive tract, but we did find a few things that we need to address.
[patient] okay, what did you find?
[doctor] you have gastroesophageal reflux disease, which we biopsied, and you also have a distal esophageal reflux-induced stricture, which we dilated to 18 mm. the rest of your upper endoscopy was normal. we are waiting for the results of the biopsies to see what further treatment we need to do.
[patient] what does this mean for me?
[doctor] well, gerd is a chronic condition that requires management over time. we will continue your aciphex medication and add some anti-reflux precautions such as avoiding spicy and acidic foods, eating smaller meals, and avoiding laying down immediately after eating. as for the stricture, we have dilated it to 18 mm, which should help with your dysphagia.
[patient] do i need any further treatment?
[doctor] we will wait for the biopsy results to determine if there is any further action we need to take. in the meantime, i want you to follow up with me on a p.r.n. basis.
[patient] okay, thank you for explaining everything to me.
[doctor] of course, if you have any further questions or concerns, don't hesitate to contact me.","[doctor] hi there, how're you feeling after the upper endoscopy, um?

[doctor] i understand. so we did an endoscopy and found a solitary erosion over a fold at the ge junction, gastric side. we also did not find any evidence of bleeding or varices. i want to run a liver profile test and start you on nexium 40 mg a day.
[patient] okay, that sounds good. should i be worried about the erosion? 
[doctor] we need to consider the possibility that it may be an erosion over a varix, which would be more significant. but we won't know for sure until we do further testing. that's why i want to schedule a colonoscopy for next week. 
[patient] okay, i'll make sure to do that.

"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] i'm a little sore but overall feeling okay.
[doctor] good to hear. so, the reason for the catheterization was an st-elevation myocardial infarction. we performed left and right coronary system cineangiography, left ventriculogram, and pci to the left circumflex. during the procedure, we inserted two bare-metal stents and dilated them to fix a 99% proximal left circumflex stenosis. 
[patient] okay, i understand.
[doctor] we also found mild disease throughout your other vessels, but we were able to attain excellent hemostasis and you didn't experience any complications during the procedure. your lv pressure was measured, and the lvef is 50% with inferolateral wall hypokinesis. there was no significant mitral regurgitation or gradient across the aortic valve on pullback. 
[patient] alright.
[doctor] moving forward, we will be treating you medically as an outpatient since you still have some residual stenosis in the left circumflex system and mild disease throughout other vessels.

[doctor]: i see. well, i reviewed your radiographs and spinal mri, and they show adequate decompression at l4 and l5 with no malposition or change in orientation of the screws. the mri shows a moderate fluid collection, which appears to be normal postoperative fluid. i don't see any indication for another surgery at this time.
[patient]: okay.
[doctor]: i recommend that you continue with mobilization and ambulating as much as possible. i will refer you to a physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist for further management. you can also continue taking requip for your restless leg syndrome as your primary care physician has suggested. i would like to hold off on interventional pain management for now to decrease the risk of infection due to the fluid collection.
[patient]: alright.
[doctor]: i will see you back in 3-4 weeks to ensure that you're continuing to improve. if you have any difficulties, don't hesitate to follow up with me sooner. does that sound good?
[patient]: yes, it does. um, thank you.",4
"[doctor] hi there, how can i help you today?
[patient] i have pain in my foot, it started hurting a lot yesterday and i need something for it. i had surgery on it before and there are plates and screws in there.
[doctor] i see. can you tell me a little more about the pain? does anything make it better or worse?
[patient] every time i do some exercise, it hurts more. it's chronically painful. i had an appointment with dr. xyz but it was cancelled and i don't have a primary care physician yet.
[doctor] okay, let me take a look at your foot. *examines foot* i can see some well-healed surgical scars. the foot appears to be mildly tender around the medial side, but there is no redness, heat or swelling. it doesn't appear to be grossly abnormal or causing any looseness or problems.
[patient] yeah, the surgery was done over a year ago, and i have been experiencing pain on and off since then.
[doctor] i understand. i can prescribe you some lortab 7.5 to take for the pain, but please keep in mind that it is only meant to be taken as needed and not for long-term use. also, it's important that you find a primary care physician soon to manage your overall health. do you have any questions or concerns?

"[doctor] hello there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, i'm doing okay.
[doctor] so, i see here that you have type 1 diabetes and have been off your insurance for over a year. can you tell me a bit about how you have been managing your blood sugars without regular check-ups?
[patient] yes, i have been using nph and regular insulin to maintain my blood sugars. however, i am very afraid of having low blood sugar due to a motor vehicle accident i had a few years ago that was caused by hypoglycemia.
[doctor] i understand your fear, but it is important to maintain a normal range of blood sugars to avoid further complications. have you been checking your blood sugar levels regularly?
[patient] no, i have been regulating my blood sugar levels based on how i feel.
[doctor] i see. well, it would be good to start checking your blood sugar levels regularly with a glucometer. additionally, your last hemoglobin a1c was 11.9 which is very high. it is important to get that number down to prevent further damage to your body.
[patient] i understand.
[doctor] you also mentioned that you were on lantus before and it worked well. i will consider that as a treatment option for you. however, i would like to take a few more tests to make sure that lantus is the best option for you. 
[patient] okay, sounds good.
[doctor] moving on, you also mentioned that you had a scooter accident recently. can you tell me a bit more about that?
[patient] yes, i fell off my scooter and hit my head. i had a headache for a few days after that, but it has resolved now.
[doctor] i see. you should have gone to the emergency room to get checked out. it's important to take any head injury seriously, especially if you weren't wearing a helmet. 
[patient] i know, but i didn't think it was that serious.
[doctor] it's always better to be safe than sorry. in any case, i see that you have some skin lacerations on your scalp from the accident. they appear to be healing well, but we will keep an eye on them.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] additionally, your urine microalbumin is at 100 which indicates some kidney damage. we will have to monitor that as well. 
[patient] okay.
[doctor] lastly, i see that you are requesting nexium and viagra, which are not covered by your health plan. unfortunately, i cannot prescribe those medications for you. however, we will continue to monitor your symptoms of gastroparesis and impotence and look for alternative treatments that may be covered by your insurance.
[patient] okay, that makes sense.

[patient] it still pains at times and i have been taking tylenol occasionally. i was also wondering if i could use a knee brace to help me with it.
[doctor] knee braces can have a tourniquet-like effect which can increase your edema or put you at risk for venous thromboembolic disease. so, for now, i suggest you stick to your cane and walker.

[patient] hi. i am doing alright.
[doctor] i am glad to hear that. i have reviewed your exam and i see that you underwent a left heart cath, selective coronary angiogram, right common femoral angiogram, and starclose closure of right common femoral artery. what led you to have this exam?
[patient] well, i had an abnormal stress test result and i had an episode of shortness of breath.
[doctor] i see. during the exam, we found that your left main artery is large in caliber and angiographically free of disease. your left anterior descending artery, which is also a large-caliber vessel, shows an area of 60% to 70% stenosis, most likely in its mid portion. there is a mild 30% to 40% stenosis in the proximal right coronary artery. the rest of your vessels are angiographically free of disease. additionally, your lvedp was measured at 40 mmhg and no gradient between lv and aorta was noted.

[doctor] okay. have you been in counseling before?
[patient] yes, i have, but my old therapist is no longer in practice.
[doctor] i see. well, i think it would be beneficial for you to continue with counseling. you mentioned that you have plans to go back to counseling this saturday, is that right?
[patient] yes, that's correct.
[doctor] great. i'll make sure to refer you to a psychiatrist who can help with your medication management. it sounds like prozac has worked well for you in the past, so i'll keep that in mind. in the meantime, i recommend that you stay off antidepressants unless absolutely necessary, since you mentioned feeling better after discontinuing them. and i'm glad to hear that you're already taking steps to take care of your mental health.
[patient] thank you.
[doctor] you're welcome. is there anything else you'd like to talk about or any questions you have for me?
[patient] no, i think that's all for now.
[doctor] alright. we'll keep an eye on your vital signs and run some additional tests, but for now, you can contract for safety, meaning you can assure us that you won't harm yourself. if you need anything, please don't hesitate to let us know.","[doctor] hi, i'm dr.

[patient] uh, well, i've been going through a tough time with my second marriage falling apart. my husband had an affair with one of my best friends and moved in with her. i've been struggling with depression, and i started taking citalopram in january. but my mood has only gotten worse since then and i lost 40 pounds. i guess i made a mistake and overdosed on it along with my warfarin.

[doctor] you were admitted to the hospital with acute right lobar pneumonia which caused hypoxemia and hypotension. you also had electrolyte abnormalities with hyponatremia and hypokalemia which were corrected. in addition, you had elevated liver function tests and anemia. you also had a darkened mole on your scalp which was biopsied, and the results are pending.
[patient] oh, i see.
[doctor] you were started on antibiotics for the pneumonia and were given iv flagyl and levaquin. your liver function tests were monitored and showed improvement over time. you also received two units of packed red cells for cardiovascular support.
[patient] yes, i remember.
[doctor] at the time of discharge, your sodium level was 135, potassium was 3.7, and your alt was 109, ast was 70. your hemoglobin was 12.1 and your hematocrit was 36.8. your electrolyte levels have been stabilized and your liver function tests have improved.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] upon discharge, you were sent to a long-term acute facility under the care of dr. z. you will continue to take flagyl and levaquin as prescribed. your pneumonia has improved, but you still require acute care. dr. z will monitor your back discomfort which is due to mild degenerative disk disease.

"[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm okay, thank you.
[doctor] so, i understand that you are planning to quit smoking before your surgery. that's great. just to let you know, quitting smoking at least six to eight days before surgery can lower the risk of complications such as dvt, pe rates and marginal ulcer problems. 
[patient] okay, i'll definitely quit before surgery.
[doctor] that's good to hear. i also want to discuss with you a little bit about the surgery itself. we talked about the possibility of laparoscopic gastric bypass, and even open surgery, but there are risks and benefits to consider. 
[patient] yes, you explained it to me last time. 
[doctor] yes, i just want to make sure you understand that there are specific complications related to gastric bypass surgery, such as gastrojejunal stricture, marginal ulcer, small bowel obstruction, gallstone formation, and other long-term complications. i also want to remind you that you are at a higher risk of complications due to your super morbid obese condition, and your major cardiopulmonary and metabolic comorbidities. so, we have a multidisciplinary team in place to help you prepare, including a cardiologist, pulmonologist, psychologist, nutritionist, and exercise physiologist. 
[patient] okay, i understand. 
[doctor] great. we also discussed that you need to start exercising to increase your flexibility and muscle tone before surgery to help with your recovery. i also want to remind you that you will need a retrievable ivc filter and will go home on lovenox. 
[patient] okay, i'll make sure to follow all the instructions you give me. 
[doctor] that's great to hear. we will work together to ensure that everything goes smoothly. i will see you again in a few weeks before the planned date of surgery.","[doctor] hey, how's it going? feeling alright today?
[patient] um, yeah, i'm doing alright, thanks.
[doctor] so, i heard you want to kick the smoking habit before your surgery. that's awesome! just want to give you a heads up that stopping smoking at least six to eight days before the surgery can help reduce the risk of complications, like dvt, pe, and stomach ulcers. 
[patient] mm-hmm, got it. i'll definitely quit before surgery.
[doctor] sweet! now, let's talk a little bit about the surgery itself. we discussed the possibility of laparoscopic gastric bypass or open surgery, but i want to make sure you're aware of the risks and benefits of each. 
[patient] yeah, you already talked to me about that last time.
[doctor] right, right. i just want to make sure you know about the specific complications that can come with gastric bypass surgery, like gastrojejunal stricture, stomach ulcers, bowel obstruction, gallstones, and other long-term difficulties. also, because of your super morbid obesity, as well as your major cardiopulmonary and metabolic conditions, you're at higher risk for complications. that's why we've got a whole team lined up to help you prep for the surgery - a cardiologist, pulmonologist, psychologist, nutritionist, and exercise physiologist. 
[patient] okay, i'm following you.
[doctor] awesome! we also talked about how important it is for you to start exercising to build up your muscles and flexibility before the surgery, which will help with recovery. and, just a reminder, you'll need a retrievable ivc filter and will go home on lovenox.

"[doctor] hello, sir. how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm feeling alright, just a little tired.
[doctor] i understand. you've had a complicated postoperative course, but i'm glad to see that you're stabilized and improving in strength. so, you're here to enter our cardiac rehabilitation program?
[patient] yes, that's correct.
[doctor] great. before we start, i'd like to ask about your exercise capacity. how have you been feeling lately?
[patient] well, i get fatigued easily and have shortness of breath, but no chest pain.
[doctor] okay, thank you for letting me know. during your recent exercise test, you stopped at 3 minutes and 20 seconds with fatigue and shortness of breath. you did not experience any chest pain, which is good. you achieved a maximal heart rate of 100, which is 72% of your maximal predicted heart rate. your maximal blood pressure was 190/70, resulting in a double product of 19,000 and achieving 2.3 mets. does that sound about right?
[patient] yes, that's what i remember.
[doctor] good. based on your exercise test and physical examination, i believe you have poor exercise capacity 6 weeks following an aortic valve replacement and single-vessel bypass procedure. however, there were no significant ecg changes with exercise, and you only had rare ventricular premature beats. you're considered stable to enter our cardiac rehabilitation program.
[patient] that's good to hear.
[doctor] before we start, i recommend you have a complete blood count, basic metabolic profile, and tsh obtained. we need to make sure everything is in order before beginning the program. do you have any questions for me?

"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?
[patient] hello, doctor. i am feeling better now.
[doctor] i am glad to hear that. i reviewed your medical notes and it seems that you had a procedure - an upper endoscopy with removal of food impaction. can you tell me what led to that?
[patient] yes, i have been experiencing dysphagia on and off for two years. but recently, i was not able to swallow anything, including my saliva. i had beef stew for lunch and suddenly noticed that i was unable to finish my meal. since then, i have not been able to eat anything.
[doctor] i see. that must have been uncomfortable for you. do you take any medications?
[patient] yes, i take coumadin. i think my inr was 2.5 during the procedure.
[doctor] i see. during the procedure, a meat bolus was found in your distal esophagus. it was removed with the help of the roth net and snare. you were given conscious sedation initially but you were not tolerating it. so, we continued with propofol sedation. you might have some bruising and submucosal hemorrhage in the esophagus due to the food impaction and coumadin therapy. but no active bleeding was seen.
[patient] okay, thank you for explaining that to me.
[doctor] you're welcome. the impression shows a distal esophageal stricture with food impaction that was treated during the procedure. you will be given iv protonix 40 mg q.12h and a clear liquid diet for 24 hours. after 24 hours, you may take soft pureed diet only until your next endoscopy, which we will schedule in three to four weeks. you should take prevacid solutab 30 mg b.i.d. on discharge.
[patient] alright, doctor. thank you for your help.
[doctor] you're welcome. if you experience any discomfort or have any questions, feel free to call us anytime.","[doctor] hey! how's it going? feeling any better?

[patient] yeah, sure. so, i've had trouble swallowing on and off for a couple of years, but recently it got really bad. i had some beef stew for lunch one day and suddenly couldn't swallow anything, not even my own saliva. since then, i haven't been able to eat anything at all.
[doctor] wow, that must have been tough. are you on any meds?
[patient] yeah, i take coumadin. i think my inr was 2.5 during the procedure.
[doctor] got it. during the procedure, we found a meat bolus in your distal esophagus. we used a roth net and snare to remove it with the help of conscious sedation at first, but you weren't tolerating it so we switched to propofol sedation. you might have some bruising and submucosal hemorrhage in the esophagus due to the food impaction and the coumadin, but there was no active bleeding.

"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the urgent cardiac catheterization and coronary angiogram?
[patient] i feel a bit groggy but better now.
[doctor] i'm glad to hear that. so, during the procedure, we inserted a sheath into your right femoral artery and performed selective coronary angiograms using a left and a 3drc catheter. we didn't find any disease in your left main, left anterior descending, circumflex, or right coronary artery.
[patient] that's good to hear.
[doctor] yes, it means that you have a normal coronary angiogram.

"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after the sigmoidoscopy?
[patient] hi doctor, i'm feeling okay, a little bit uncomfortable.
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that. i just wanted to go over the results with you. during the procedure, we were able to visualize the sigmoid colon up to 25 cm. however, we were unable to pass the scope beyond that due to either a stricture or a bend caused by multiple previous surgeries. we did find internal and external hemorrhoids during the examination. 
[patient] okay, what does that mean?
[doctor] well, the inability to pass the scope beyond 25 cm means that we weren't able to complete the sigmoidoscopy. however, we were able to examine the sigmoid colon up to that point, and everything looked normal in that area. the hemorrhoids are a common finding and can be managed with medications and lifestyle modifications.

[patient] i haven't had any issues with it so far.
[doctor] that's good to hear. during the interrogation, we found that your pacemaker is functioning normally. your atrial lead is set at 2.5 volts with a pulse width of 0.5 msec and your ventricular lead is set at 2.5 volts with a pulse width of 0.5 msec. the atrial capture is at 0.75 volts at 0.5 msec, and the ventricular capture is at 0.5 volts at 0.5 msec. the sensing in the atrium is 5.34 to 5.8 millivolts, r sensing is 12-12.0 millivolts, atrial lead impedance 590 ohms, and ventricular lead impedance 750 ohms.

"[doctor] hello, how are you feeling?
[patient] i feel better now, thank you.
[doctor] i'm glad to hear that. so, the procedure went well and we have implanted a dual chamber permanent pacemaker in your left cephalic vein.
[patient] okay, what does that mean exactly?
[doctor] it means that we have placed a device in your chest that will help regulate your heartbeat, as we found that you have had intermittent severe sinus bradycardia. this device will help maintain a normal rhythm.
[patient] okay, i understand now. what else can you tell me about the procedure?
[doctor] well, we used intravenous sedation with versed and fentanyl to keep you comfortable during the procedure. we made a small incision below your left clavicle and created a pocket for the pulse generator. we used a medium-sized cephalic vein to insert the two pacing leads which were then anchored to the pulse generator. the leads were tested with a pacing systems analyzer and the results were noted. the pocket was irrigated with antibiotic solution and closed up with stitches. your estimated blood loss was only about 20 ml, and there were no complications.

"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i am feeling okay, a bit weak.
[doctor] i understand that you had a left heart catheterization yesterday. i have the report here with me. it says that you have three-vessel coronary artery disease involving a subtotaled left anterior descending artery with timi-i flow distally and 90% circumflex lesion and 90% right coronary artery lesion. do you understand what that means?
[patient] not exactly, could you explain it to me, please?
[doctor] sure. so, your coronary arteries are the blood vessels that supply blood and oxygen to your heart muscles. the report shows that three of your coronary arteries have blockages, and these blockages are significant enough to cause a reduction in blood flow to your heart. the left anterior descending artery, which is one of the vessels that supply blood to the front of your heart, has a severe blockage in its middle portion, and the flow of blood there is minimal. the circumflex artery, which is around the back of your heart, also has a severe blockage, and your right coronary artery has a significant blockage in the middle portion.
[patient] oh, i see. what's the plan now?
[doctor] the plan is to transfer you to providence hospital today for a pci of the mid lad lesion with a surgical evaluation for a coronary artery bypass grafting. in simpler terms, we will try to open up the blockage in your left anterior descending artery with a procedure called pci, and if this is not successful or if there are other blockages, you may need to have coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. we are also continuing aggressive medical therapy, including medication such as beta-blockers, aspirin, ace inhibitors, and statins. however, we will not be placing you on plavix due to the possibility of coronary bypass grafting. additionally, we cannot give you lovenox and integrilin due to your history of cranial aneurysmal bleed.
[patient] okay, i understand. thank you for explaining it to me.
[doctor] you're welcome. do you have any other questions or concerns?
[patient] no, i think i understand everything.","[doctor] alright, sounds good. um, please let me know if you have any questions or if anything changes, okay?

[doctor] okay, we will need to perform some tests to see what's going on. we will start with a stress test as part of your evaluation for chest pain. 
[patient] alright.
[doctor] your stress test revealed left ventricular dilatations suggestive of multivessel disease. we need to perform a left heart catheterization and bilateral selective coronary angiography to get a clearer picture of what's going on. 
[patient] what does that involve?
[doctor] we will use a thin-walled argon needle to cannulate the right femoral artery and use a catheter to check the left main coronary artery, left anterior descending coronary artery, left circumflex coronary artery, and right coronary artery. we will be able to see the extent of the damage and narrowings in your arteries. 
[patient] okay, but what are the risks?
[doctor] the risks are minimal, but there is a slight chance of bleeding, artery blockage, or damage to the artery from the catheter. we will make sure to monitor you carefully during and after the procedure. 
[patient] sounds good. 
[doctor] after the procedure, we found that you have a three-vessel coronary artery disease and a moderate mitral regurgitation per tee. we will consult cardiovascular and thoracic surgery for cabg and mitral valve repair versus replacement.

"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?
[patient] i'm doing alright, thanks.
[doctor] good to hear. so, the reason we did the endoscopy was to check for an upper gi source of your abdominal pain. can you tell me more about the pain you've been experiencing?
[patient] yeah, i've been having biliary colic-type symptoms for the past 3-1/2 weeks. the pain is very severe and is brought on by eating greasy foods. i had similar episodes a couple of years ago, and i was told that i had gallstones, but after my pregnancy, a repeat ultrasound was done, and apparently, it was normal. recently, i went to the emergency department when the pain recurred, and laboratory studies were unrevealing. an ultrasound was normal, but a hida scan was done, which showed a low normal ejection fraction of 40%, and moderate reproduction of my pain.
[doctor] i see. well, we did the endoscopy, and i'm happy to say that everything looked normal. we took gastric biopsies to rule out any possibility of helicobacter, but nothing concerning was found.

"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after the endoscopy procedure?
[patient] i'm doing okay, just a little bit sore.
[doctor] alright, so let's go over the results of your egd. it looks like the entire length of your esophagus had numerous white punctate lesions, which makes us suspect eosinophilic esophagitis. we did not see any stricture or barrett mucosa, which is good news. however, we did take biopsies throughout the entire length of your esophagus to confirm the diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis.
[patient] what is eosinophilic esophagitis?
[doctor] it's a condition where the lining of your esophagus becomes inflamed due to an allergic reaction. this can cause symptoms like difficulty swallowing, chest pain, and heartburn. it's not a life-threatening condition, but it can be uncomfortable.
[patient] what are the next steps?
[doctor] we'll wait for the biopsy results to come back to confirm the diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis. if that's the case, we'll work on a treatment plan which will most likely involve avoiding certain foods that trigger the allergic reaction and taking medication to reduce inflammation. in the meantime, you should avoid any foods that you know cause you trouble and continue taking any medications that were previously prescribed to you.

[patient] okay.
[doctor] we did find minimal plaque in the diagonal branch ii and the obtuse marginal branch iii, but there were no focal stenoses, which means there were no significant blockages. your left ventricular function is normal, and the evaluation showed that there is no mitral regurgitation.

[doctor] first of all, you have moderate-to-severe coronary artery disease. there's a high-grade lesion seen at the ostium of the first diagonal artery as well as a 60% to 70% lesion seen at the mid portion of the right coronary artery. this means that you have some blockages in your heart's blood vessels.

[patient] hi, i'm doing okay, thank you for asking.
[doctor] i have the results of your modified barium swallow study, it looks like you are experiencing premature spillage to the level of the valleculae and pyriform sinuses with thin liquid. there is decreased tongue base retraction contributing to vallecular pooling after the swallow. however, there was no aspiration noted during the evaluation, which is great news. 
[patient] okay, that's good to hear.
[doctor] there was some penetration noted with cup sips of thin liquid, but trace residual was present on the valleculae and on the tongue base with nectar-thick puree and solid consistencies. 
[patient] i see.
[doctor] based on this evaluation, the prognosis for swallowing and safety is good. however, i do have some recommendations for you to decrease the risk of aspiration and penetration. firstly, take small bites and small sips during meals. secondly, remain upright at a 90-degree angle for at least 45 minutes after meals to decrease the risk of aspiration and penetration as well as to reduce your globus sensation. lastly, i suggest that you follow up with a gastroenterologist for further evaluation of your esophageal function.
[patient] alright, thank you for your advice.
[doctor] you're welcome. at this time, you do not need any skilled speech therapy for your swallowing abilities, and you are discharged from my services.","[doctor] hiya, how's it going? feeling alright today?
[patient] um, yeah, i'm doing okay. thanks for asking.
[doctor] so i got the results of that modified barium swallow study we did. it looks like you're having some premature spillage to the valleculae and pyriform sinuses with thin liquids. you're having some trouble retracting your tongue base, which is adding to the vallecular pooling. but, the good news is that there was no aspiration during the evaluation. 
[patient] mm-hmm, okay.
[doctor] we did see some penetration with cup sips of thin liquid, and there was some residual on the valleculae and tongue base with thicker liquids and solids. 
[patient] got it.
[doctor] now, the prognosis for your swallowing and safety is looking good. but, i do have some recommendations to minimize the risk of aspiration and penetration. firstly, try taking smaller bites and sips during meals. secondly, stay upright at a 90-degree angle for at least 45 minutes after eating to reduce the risk of aspiration and penetration, and to help with your globus sensation. lastly, i suggest following up with a gastroenterologist to assess your esophageal function.
[patient] alright, thank you for the advice.
[doctor] no problemo. and, you're all set for now. you won't need any skilled speech therapy for your swallowing abilities, and you're discharged from my services.",3
"[doctor] hello, how are you doing today?
[patient] i'm a little nervous, to be honest.
[doctor] that's understandable. i know we've been monitoring the mass in your right temporal lobe, and based on the mri scan, it's highly concerning for a high-grade glioma. we've discussed the possible options for treatment, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. have you had any thoughts about which option you would prefer?
[patient] yes, after weighing the risks and benefits, i would like to proceed with a surgical biopsy and resection of the mass, along with chemotherapy and radiation. i understand that there are risks involved, but i believe it's the best option for me.
[doctor] i agree, given the characteristics of the mass. we will proceed with a right temporal craniotomy for biopsy and likely resection of the tumor. you will need to be n.p.o. after midnight on wednesday night, and we will have you undergo a preoperative assessment with the anesthesiology tomorrow morning. how have you been feeling otherwise? any changes in your symptoms?
[patient] i've had some headaches and occasional seizures, but nothing too severe.
[doctor] okay, we will continue to monitor your symptoms and adjust your treatment plan as needed. i'm glad that you've undergone vocational rehab assessment as well, so we can ensure that you have the support you need during your recovery. do you have any other questions or concerns?
[patient] no, i think i understand everything. thank you for explaining everything clearly to me.
[doctor] of course, it's important to us that you feel informed and comfortable with your treatment plan. we'll be with you every step of the way.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?

[patient] the pain has been well controlled, doctor. i haven't had any fevers, chills, or night sweats.
[doctor] that's good to hear. have you noticed any other symptoms?
[patient] i've had some mild drainage from my pin sites, but they haven't been red or inflamed. i just started doing some range of motion exercises for my right knee. i haven't had any numbness or tingling.
[doctor] okay, thank you for letting me know. on examination, i noticed some mild drainage from your pin sites, but they look good overall. your strength in the ehl and fhl is 3/5, and you have intact sensation to light touch in a dp, sp, and tibial nerve distribution. we took some x-rays of your knee, and everything looks good with the hardware placement and alignment.
[patient] that's good news.
[doctor] yes, it is. i'm going to prescribe you some aggressive range of motion exercises for your right knee. it's important to work on this since you haven't had much range of motion up to this point. you should remain non-weightbearing, and i would like to see you back in 2 weeks to assess your knee range of motion. you won't need any x-rays at that time.

[doctor] that's normal after receiving conscious sedation. i have some good news and some concerning news regarding your echocardiogram results. would you like me to go over them with you?
[patient] yes, please do.
[doctor] your left ventricular size and systolic function are normal, which is great news. however, we did find a thrombus, or a blood clot, in the left atrial appendage of your heart. this could be a source of your neurological deficit. we also found mild mitral regurgitation with two jets and mild nonmobile descending aortic atherosclerosis.
[patient] what does that mean for me?
[doctor] well, the thrombus is concerning because it could increase your risk for stroke. we will need to start you on blood thinners immediately to prevent any clots from forming. the mild mitral regurgitation and atherosclerosis are not as concerning, but we will monitor them closely.
[patient] okay, i understand. what are the next steps?
[doctor] we will consult with a hematologist to determine the best blood thinner for you and adjust your dose accordingly. we will also monitor your heart closely and schedule a follow-up echocardiogram to check on the thrombus and the other findings. in the meantime, it's important to take your medications as prescribed and follow up with all of your appointments.

"[doctor] hi, how are you today?
[patient] hi, i'm doing okay. a little sore from the procedure yesterday.
[doctor] yes, i can imagine. so, we did an echocardiogram yesterday to assess your aortic valve replacement. how are you feeling?
[patient] well, i'm a little worried about the results. can you tell me what you found?
[doctor] of course. so, we did find a moderate stenosis of your aortic valve replacement. we also noticed some mild mitral regurgitation, but your left ventricular function is normal.
[patient] okay, what does that mean for me?
[doctor] well, we'll need to re-evaluate you in two to three years with another echocardiogram to see if the stenosis has progressed. depending on the results, we may need to consider another procedure. but for now, we'll just keep an eye on it.
[patient] what about the regurgitation?
[doctor] the mitral regurgitation is not severe enough to require any immediate action. we'll just continue to monitor it as well.
[patient] okay. is there anything else i should be concerned about?
[doctor] no, everything else looked normal. your left atrium was mildly dilated, but there were no masses or thrombi. the right atrium and right ventricle were both normal in size, and your tricuspid valve was structurally normal. the interatrial septum also appeared to be intact.
[patient] that's good to hear.
[doctor] yes, overall, the procedure went well and there were no immediate complications. we'll just need to keep an eye on the stenosis and regurgitation and re-evaluate you in a few years.
[patient] okay, thank you for explaining everything to me.
[doctor] of course, anytime. do you have any other questions or concerns?
[patient] no, i think i'm good for now.
[doctor] alright, well if you have any other concerns, please don't hesitate to contact us. have a good day.
[patient] thank you, you too.","[doctor] hi, how are you today?
[patient] um, hi there. i'm doing okay, i guess. a little sore from the procedure yesterday.
[doctor] mm-hmm, i can imagine. so, we did an echocardiogram yesterday to assess your aortic valve replacement. how are you feeling?
[patient] well, uh, i'm a little worried about the results. can you tell me what you found?
[doctor] sure thing. so, we did find a moderate stenosis of your aortic valve replacement. we also noticed some mild mitral regurgitation, but your left ventricular function is normal.
[patient] okay, what does that mean for me?
[doctor] well, we'll need to re-evaluate you in two to three years with another echocardiogram to see if the stenosis has progressed. depending on the results, we may need to consider another procedure. but for now, we'll just keep an eye on it.
[patient] what about the regurgitation?
[doctor] the mitral regurgitation is not severe enough to require any immediate action. we'll just continue to monitor it as well.
[patient] okay. is there anything else i should be concerned about?
[doctor] nope, everything else looked normal. your left atrium was mildly dilated, but there were no masses or thrombi. the right atrium and right ventricle were both normal in size, and your tricuspid valve was structurally normal. the interatrial septum also appeared to be intact.

"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm not feeling too great, doctor. i've been experiencing some fullness in my chest and my cardiac enzymes were elevated.
[doctor] i see. well, let me take a look at your medical notes here. it says that you are taking femara, verapamil, dyazide, hyzaar, glyburide, and metformin. is that correct?
[patient] yes, that's correct.
[doctor] okay, and your baseline ekg shows sinus rhythm at 84 beats per minute with poor anteroseptal r-wave progression and mild lateral st abnormalities. you also had an exercise stress test, and it looks like your heart rate increased from 84 to 138, or 93% of your maximum predicted heart rate. your blood pressure also rose from 150/88 to 210/100. did you experience any chest pain during the test?
[patient] no, i didn't.
[doctor] okay. based on the results, we decided to do a nuclear perfusion imaging test that showed no evidence of exercise-induced ischemia at a high myocardial workload. your sum score was 0. however, the test did reveal that you have mild hypertensive cardiomyopathy with an ef of 48%. we also noticed that your blood pressure was suboptimally controlled during today's exam.
[patient] what does all of that mean?
[doctor] well, it essentially excludes obstructive cad as a cause of your elevated troponin, which is good news. however, it does show that you have some heart muscle thickening due to your high blood pressure. we'll need to work on getting your blood pressure under control and monitor your heart function. we also noticed that you have poor exercise capacity due to cardiovascular deconditioning, which means we will need to work on improving your fitness level.
[patient] what will the treatment plan be?
[doctor] we will need to adjust your medications to better control your blood pressure and monitor your heart function with regular check-ups. we will also refer you to a cardiac rehabilitation program to improve your fitness level.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?

"[doctor] hi, how are you?
[patient] hi, i'm not doing well.
[doctor] what seems to be the problem?
[patient] i'm having progressive lower extremity weakness.
[doctor] i see. based on your medical history, you had a right frontal glioblastoma multiforme diagnosed by brain biopsy/partial resection. do you still have this?
[patient] yes, i underwent treatment for this including radiation therapy and chemotherapy.
[doctor] i see. when did you start experiencing the lower extremity weakness?
[patient] i complained of non-radiating dull low back pain and proximal lower extremity weakness during my fourth course of chemotherapy for 5fu/carboplatin on 10/12/92.
[doctor] okay, and have you experienced any bowel/bladder difficulty?
[patient] no, i have not.
[doctor] based on your current symptoms, i suspect steroid myopathy. however, we need to rule out the possibility of ""drop"" metastasis. an mri of the l-spine was obtained, and the results showed fine linear enhancement along the dorsal aspect of the conus medullaris, suggestive of subarachnoid seeding of tumor. no focal mass or cord compression was visualized. csf examination revealed 19rbc, 22wbc, 17 lymphocytes, and 5 histiocytes, glucose 56, protein 150. cytology was negative. unfortunately, it seems that your tumor has grown and spread, causing worsening back pain and lower extremity weakness. you are now predominantly wheelchair-bound and will need to enter a hospice.

[patient] hi, doctor. i'm not feeling good. i've been having pain in my right shoulder for about four months now.
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that. can you describe the pain to me? are there any other symptoms?
[patient] yes, the pain has been progressively getting worse. i also have stiffness in my neck and numbness in my right hand's first two fingers. recently, i have also been experiencing pain in my right upper extremity and numbness in my lower extremities, along with pain in the coccygeal region. the pain usually worsens at night and disturbs my sleep. sometimes, when i flex my neck, i feel an electric shock-like sensation shooting down my spine. 
[doctor] okay, have you had any bowel or bladder problems, visual changes or any issues with your left arm?
[patient] no, i haven't experienced any of those symptoms.
[doctor] do you have a history of neck, back or head trauma?
[patient] no, i don't have any such history.

[patient] yes, that's fine.
[doctor] i'd like to check your vital signs first. 
[patient] okay.
[doctor] your vital signs appear to be normal. i will now do a neurological examination. 
[patient] sure.
[doctor] your cn is unremarkable, and your motor strength, tone, and muscle bulk seem fine. there are no deficits on the sensory examination. your coordination, gait, and station are also normal. 
[patient] okay.
[doctor] based on my examination and your symptoms, i'm going to order an mri of your cervical spine. it seems there might be a c-spine lesion.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] the mri revealed that you have a central c5-6 disc herniation that is compressing your spinal cord at that level. we will also do an emg/ncv test to confirm the diagnosis. 
[patient] oh, okay.
[doctor] the emg/ncv showed normal ncv, but 1+ sharps and fibrillations in the right biceps (c5-6), brachioradialis (c5-6), triceps (c7-8) and teres major. additionally, there were 2+ sharps and fibrillations in the right pronator terres. these findings are consistent with a c6-7 radiculopathy.

"[doctor]: hello, how are you today? 
[patient]: i am okay, thanks for asking. 
[doctor]: i have reviewed your medical history and it looks like you have been experiencing progressive loss of color vision in your right eye for about a year now. have you noticed any other symptoms? 
[patient]: no, other than blurred vision and a central scotoma in my right eye. 
[doctor]: i see. during your last examination, it was noted that there was a 0.8 log unit rapd in your right eye and optic disk pallor as well. did you experience any pain or discomfort during that time? 
[patient]: no, i did not. 
[doctor]: based on your medical history and examination, it seems like you may have an optic neuropathy/atrophy in your right eye. however, we need to rule out the possibility of a mass lesion affecting the optic nerve. we may need to pay particular attention to the area of the optic canal, cavernous sinus, and sphenoid sinus. 
[patient]: okay, what are the next steps? 
[doctor]: we will need to conduct a brain ct scan with contrast to get a clearer picture of any possible mass lesion. we will also conduct an mri orbit with and without gadolinium contrast to confirm the diagnosis. 
[patient]: okay, when can we schedule these tests? 
[doctor]: we can schedule them as soon as possible to confirm our diagnosis and proceed with treatment. it is important to note that surgical resection and biopsy may be deferred due to the risk of blindness and the suspicion that the tumor is a slow-growing meningioma. we will monitor the tumor at six-month intervals to determine if there are any changes in size or symptoms.

[doctor] okay, let's do a quick physical exam. your vital signs look good, your blood pressure is 150/70 and your heart sounds are heard with a grade 2/6 systolic murmur at the precordium. your chest looks clear, but i do see evidence of right lower arm amputation and some suprapubic tenderness in your abdomen. how have your pain levels been?
[patient] they've been okay, i've been taking vicodin and percocet for pain control.
[doctor] okay, have you been experiencing any other symptoms?
[patient] no, not really.
[doctor] your lab results are showing that you have hypokalemia, a urinary tract infection, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. you also have uncontrolled type ii diabetes and hypothyroidism. you're currently taking prevacid 30 mg daily, levothyroxine 75 mcg a day, toprol 25 mg twice a day, zofran 4 mg every 6 hours, coumadin 5 mg, amiodarone 200 mg a day, lexapro 20 mg a day, plavix 75 mg a day, fenofibrate 145 mg, lasix 20 mg iv twice a day, lantus 50 units at bedtime and humalog 10 units before meals with sliding scale insulin coverage.
[patient] yes, that's right.
[doctor] we'll need to monitor your electrolytes closely as your potassium levels are low. we'll switch you to k-dur 40 meq twice a day to help with that. we'll also need to monitor your left heel ulcer and adjust your insulin dosage accordingly. we'll continue with wound care to your right heel as well as physical therapy. we'll also give you antibiotics for your urinary tract infection.
[patient] sounds good to me.
[doctor] alright, let's keep you on this treatment plan and i'll check in on you later.","[doctor] hi, how's everything going with you today?

"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, i am doing alright. just a bit concerned about my balance issues.
[doctor] yes, i understand. we did an assessment of your peripheral vestibular function and i have the results here. your otoscopy showed bilateral intact tympanic membranes with central weber test and bilateral positive rinne. your romberg test showed that you maintained postural stability, which is good. your frenzel glasses examination showed no spontaneous or end gaze nystagmus, and your head shaking did not provoke any nystagmus. your dix-hallpike test showed no positional nystagmus, which excludes benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. however, your vestibulo-ocular reflex (halmagyi test) showed corrective saccades, giving the impression of decompensated vestibular hypofunction.
[patient] oh, i see. what does that mean for me?
[doctor] well, it seems that you have vestibular hypofunction, which means your inner ear is not sending correct signals to your brain about your balance. the good news is that we can treat this. i advise you to continue doing your vestibular rehabilitation exercises and take betahistine at a 24 mg dose twice a day. this medication can help improve blood flow to your inner ear and reduce your symptoms. we also plan to do an electronystagmography to document the degree of your vestibular hypofunction.

[doctor] great. so, i see from your medical history that you have been referred to us for laparoscopic gastric bypass. is that correct?
[patient] yes, that's correct.
[doctor] alright. i see that you have tried other nonsurgical methods for weight loss but have been unsuccessful. your bmi is currently 43, and you meet the national institute of health criteria for this procedure. i've also done a physical examination and everything looks good, except for the stigmata of morbid obesity.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] i just want to let you know that there are risks and benefits associated with this procedure, and it's important to understand them before moving forward. we will need to monitor you closely after the procedure and you will need to adhere to dietary and exercise guidelines. there are also potential complications such as dvt, pe, leak peritonitis, sepsis, shock, and multisystem organ failure, as well as the need for re-operation, gastrostomy or jejunostomy for feeding, and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. short-term complications such as gastrojejunal stricture, marginal ulcer, and small bowel obstruction can also occur. long-term complications such as hair loss, excess skin, multivitamin and mineral deficiencies, protein-calorie malnutrition, weight regain, and weight plateauing are also possible. are you aware of all these risks?
[patient] yes, i understand.
[doctor] great. to prepare for the surgery, you will need to undergo a very low-calorie diet through medifast to decrease the size of your liver and optimize your cardiopulmonary and metabolic comorbidities. you will also need to see a psychologist, nutritionist, and exercise physiologist for a multidisciplinary approach to ensure success for both the short and long term. does that sound good to you?
[patient] yes, it does.
[doctor] alright. i will see you again two weeks before the planned surgery for further discussion and to answer any other questions you may have.","[doctor] hi there, how are you doing today?

[doctor] mm-hmm. so, i see from your medical history that you have been referred to us for laparoscopic gastric bypass. is that correct?
[patient] oh, uh, yes, that's correct.
[doctor] alrighty. i see that you have tried other nonsurgical methods for weight loss but have been unsuccessful. your bmi is currently 43, and you meet the national institute of health criteria for this procedure. i've also done a physical examination and everything looks good, except for the stigmata of morbid obesity.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] so, i just want to let you know that there are risks and benefits associated with this procedure, and it's important to understand them before moving forward. we will need to monitor you closely after the procedure and you will need to adhere to dietary and exercise guidelines. there are also potential complications such as dvt, pe, leak peritonitis, sepsis, shock, and multisystem organ failure, as well as the need for re-operation, gastrostomy or jejunostomy for feeding, and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. short-term complications such as gastrojejunal stricture, marginal ulcer, and small bowel obstruction can also occur. long-term complications such as hair loss, excess skin, multivitamin and mineral deficiencies, protein-calorie malnutrition, weight regain, and weight plateauing are also possible. do you get what i'm saying?
[patient] mm-hmm, i understand.
[doctor] perfect. to prepare for the surgery, you will need to undergo a very low-calorie diet through medifast to decrease the size of your liver and optimize your cardiopulmonary and metabolic comorbidities. you will also need to see a psychologist, nutritionist, and exercise physiologist for a multidisciplinary approach to ensure success for both the short and long term. does that sound good to you?
[patient] yeah, that sounds good.
[doctor] alrighty then. i will see you again two weeks before the planned surgery for further discussion and to answer any other questions you may have.",3
"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, i am a little worried about the results of my testicular ultrasound.
[doctor] yes, i see here that you had some swelling on the left testicle. i have the results of the test and can go over them with you if you'd like.
[patient] yes, please.
[doctor] okay, so the ultrasound shows that the left testicle is normal in size and shape, but the left epididymis has increased blood flow which is consistent with epididymitis. 
[patient] okay. what is epididymitis?
[doctor] epididymitis is an inflammation of the epididymis, which is a tube that sits at the back of the testicle and stores sperm. it can cause pain, swelling and discomfort. it can be caused by a bacterial infection or a sexually transmitted infection.
[patient] oh, i see. is it serious?
[doctor] it can be, but we caught it early which is a good thing. i would like to prescribe you some antibiotics to help treat the infection. it is important to take them as directed until they are finished to make sure the infection clears up completely.
[patient] okay, i will make sure to take them as directed.
[doctor] great. the ultrasound also showed bilateral hydroceles, which is a collection of fluid around the testicles. this can sometimes be seen after an infection or injury. it is generally not serious but can cause some discomfort.
[patient] is there anything that needs to be done about it?
[doctor] since it is not causing any problems, we can monitor it for now. if it becomes larger or more uncomfortable, then we can discuss other options.
[patient] okay, thank you for explaining everything to me.
[doctor] no problem. i will go ahead and prescribe the antibiotics and we will schedule a follow-up appointment to make sure everything is back to normal. if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, do not hesitate to call the office.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?

"[doctor] hi, how are you doing today?
[patient] hi, i'm doing alright.
[doctor] so, you're here because of some urinary problems, is that right?
[patient] yes, i've been having frequent urination at night, and sometimes during the day too.
[doctor] i see. and have you noticed any other issues, like pain or discomfort while urinating?
[patient] no, nothing like that.
[doctor] okay. well, i see from your medical history that you have had some elevated psa levels in the past. when was the last time you had your psa levels checked?
[patient] i think it was about a year ago.
[doctor] and what were the results?
[patient] they were stable, but still a bit high.
[doctor] i see. well, based on your symptoms, it sounds like you might be dealing with some bladder irritation. we can try to address this with some behavior modification first, before considering any medications. how does that sound to you?
[patient] that sounds fine to me.
[doctor] great. so, what i would like you to do is to discontinue all caffeinated and carbonated beverages, and avoid drinking any fluids three hours before going to bed. this should help reduce your nighttime urination. you mentioned that you've already noticed some improvement when you do this, is that right?
[patient] yes, that's correct.
[doctor] okay, great. let's try this for a few weeks and see how you're doing. if you're still having problems, we can consider changing your alpha-blocker to something more effective. but hopefully, with these changes, we can avoid needing any additional medications.

"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] i am feeling a bit groggy but alright.
[doctor] that's normal after the procedure you had. let me give you an update on what was done. so, the procedure went smoothly. we performed a cystourethroscopy and transurethral resection of the prostate (turp). we confirmed that you had urinary retention and benign prostatic hypertrophy, which we were able to address during the procedure.
[patient] okay, that sounds good.
[doctor] during the procedure, we utilized a #27-french resectoscope and a #26 french resectoscope loop to remove the prostatic enlargement. we were able to take down the bladder neck and the median lobe. we then moved on to the lateral lobes and made sure to maintain hemostasis along the way. we evacuated all the chips via ellik evacuator and inserted a #24 french three-way foley catheter and irrigated the area.
[patient] okay, i understand.
[doctor] we will admit you and keep you on antibiotics and pain control. we will also do bladder irrigation and a possible void trial in the morning. how does that sound?

[patient] no, i've never had blood in my urine before.
[doctor] okay. you do have a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia, correct?
[patient] yes, i had a transurethral resection of the prostate more than 10 years ago for it.
[doctor] i see. during your workup, we found that you have multiple bilateral renal cysts, but one of them did not meet the criteria for a simple cyst. you had an ultrasound which showed a mass arising from the right kidney, and an mri was scheduled for further evaluation. did you get the report back?
[patient] no, the report was not back at the time of my discharge.

[doctor] you're welcome. let us know if you have any further questions or concerns.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] um, i'm okay, doctor.
[doctor] so, we received the results of your ultrasound-guided paracentesis. it looks like you have some fluid in your abdomen, also known as ascites.
[patient] okay, mm-hmm, what does that mean?
[doctor] ascites is a buildup of fluid in your abdominal cavity. it can be caused by several things, such as liver disease or heart failure. we performed a paracentesis to remove some of the fluid and relieve any discomfort or pressure you may have been feeling.
[patient] did everything go okay during the procedure? uh, any complications?
[doctor] yes, everything went well. we obtained a total of approximately 5500 ml of serous fluid, and you tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complications.
[patient] that's good to hear. mm-hmm.
[doctor] we will send the fluid for analysis to determine the cause of the ascites. in the meantime, we will monitor your symptoms and determine the appropriate course of treatment based on the results of the analysis.
[patient] okay. so, what should i do in the meantime?
[doctor] just continue to take any medications that you have been prescribed, and follow any dietary or lifestyle modifications that we may have discussed with you. we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of the analysis and any further steps we need to take.

"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after your pacemaker implantation?
[patient] hello, i'm feeling okay, a little sore.
[doctor] that's normal. i just wanted to go over the procedure with you and make sure you understand everything that happened. so, we successfully implanted a single-chamber pacemaker through your left subclavian vein using a boston scientific altrua 60 model, serial number 123456. we had some difficulty getting the lead into your right ventricle, but we were able to cross the tricuspid valve and actively fixate the lead. we decided to proceed with a single-chamber pacemaker instead of a dual-chamber pacemaker due to concerns about your fragility and the different anatomy we noticed in your right atrium. the pacemaker was programmed as vvi 60, and we set the history at 10 to 50 beats per minute. the lead position will be evaluated with a chest x-ray.
[patient] okay, i understand. is there anything i need to do differently now that i have the pacemaker?
[doctor] yes, we'll go over all the details before you leave, but in general, you should avoid any vigorous exercise or heavy lifting for a few weeks to allow the pocket to heal. you'll also need to avoid any mri scans or other procedures that involve strong magnets or electrical fields. and of course, you'll need to follow up with me regularly to monitor the pacemaker's function and make any necessary adjustments.
[patient] alright, that makes sense. thank you for explaining everything to me.
[doctor] of course, it's important that you understand what's happening with your body and your treatment. if you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to ask.","[doctor] hey, how are you feeling after your pacemaker implantation?

[doctor] good to hear. so the pre-op diagnosis was determined to be basal cell carcinoma. and after the procedure, the post-op diagnosis remained the same, correct?
[patient] yes, that's correct.
[doctor] the basal cell carcinoma was located in the medial right inferior helix, and the size of the tumor was 1.4 x 1 cm before the surgery, but it grew to 2.7 x 2 cm afterward due to poorly defined borders, is that right?
[patient] yes, that's right.
[doctor] there were no complications during the procedure, and hemostasis was achieved through electrodessication. we also planned to do a wedge resection advancement flap for the reconstruction. prior to each stage of the surgery, the surgical site was tested for anesthesia and then prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. can you tell me how you felt during the procedure?
[patient] i was under anesthesia, so i didn't feel anything.
[doctor] that's right. during the surgery, the clinically-apparent tumor was carefully defined and debulked before the first stage to determine the extent of the surgical excision. each stage involved excising a thin layer of tissue with a narrow margin of normal appearing skin using the mohs fresh tissue technique. we prepared a map to correspond to the area of skin from which the tissue was excised, and each section was coded, cut, and stained for microscopic examination. after examining the base and margins of the tissue, any areas noted to be positive on the previous stage were removed with the mohs technique and analyzed.

[doctor] sure. we inserted a catheter into your heart to take pictures and examine the blood vessels. we found some blockages in your coronary arteries, so we performed a procedure to open up the blocked artery and placed a small metal mesh tube called a stent to keep it open. we also administered a medication called integrilin to help prevent blood clots. 
[patient] i see. and what did the angiography show?
[doctor] the left main artery was normal, but there were some mild irregularities in the left anterior descending and left circumflex arteries. the right coronary artery had moderate disease in its proximal segment with multiple areas of plaquing and a 90% stenosis between the second and third posterolateral branch. however, after the procedure, there was no residual stenosis, but there was partial occlusion of the third posterolateral branch which we were able to improve. 
[patient] okay, and what's the clinical impression?
[doctor] the procedure was successful, and we diagnosed you with two-vessel coronary artery disease with mild anterolateral and moderate inferoapical hypokinesis. we also noted elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.
[patient] what's the next step?
[doctor] we recommend bed rest, risk factor modification, and a thallium scintigraphy in approximately six weeks to assess your heart function. it's important to make some lifestyle changes such as stopping smoking, eating a heart-healthy diet, and exercising regularly. we'll also monitor your progress to determine if any additional medications or procedures are necessary.
[patient] okay, thank you for explaining everything to me.
[doctor] of course, let us know if you have any questions or concerns. we want to make sure you have a successful recovery.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after the procedure?

"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] a little sore, but otherwise alright.
[doctor] that's to be expected. so, during the procedure, we discovered that your right coronary artery was totally occluded. we were able to successfully place stents to repair the occlusion and address a small proximal dissection.
[patient] okay...
[doctor] we also found some minor distal disease in the posterolateral branch and 60% proximal left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis and 50% diagonal stenosis along with 50% stenosis of the first obtuse marginal branch.
[patient] what does that mean?
[doctor] well, it means that you have some plaque buildup in your arteries that could lead to further blockages if left untreated. we were able to address the blocked artery in the procedure, but we will need to monitor and manage the other areas of plaque buildup to prevent further blockages.
[patient] what will that involve?
[doctor] we will need to develop a treatment plan to manage your heart disease. this can include lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, as well as medication to lower your cholesterol and blood pressure. we will also need to monitor you closely and perform regular follow-up tests to ensure that your heart is functioning properly.
[patient] okay, i understand.

[doctor] i wanted to discuss the results of your recent procedure, the left heart catheterization with ventriculography and selective coronary angiography. the reason we performed this procedure was due to your acute coronary syndrome.
[patient] okay, what did you find?
[doctor] we used a 6 french pigtail, 6 french jl4, and 6 french jr4 catheters during the procedure, and the hemodynamic data showed that your aortic pressure was in the normal range with no significant gradient across the aortic valve. the ventriculogram showed that your left ventricle is normal in size and shape, with normal wall motion and ejection fraction. the angiographic data revealed insignificant coronary disease.

"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the procedures?
[patient] hi, i’m feeling okay.
[doctor] i wanted to go over the results of your procedures. so, we found that there were no significant blockages in your coronary arteries, which is good news. however, we did find some issues with the functioning of your heart.
[patient] what kind of issues?
[doctor] we found that your left ventricle is dilated and not functioning as well as it should be. we estimated your ejection fraction to be between 45 to 50%, which is lower than what we would like to see. we also found that you have severe mitral regurgitation.
[patient] what does that mean?
[doctor] mitral regurgitation means that blood is leaking back into your heart through the mitral valve, which can put extra strain on your heart. we will need to monitor this closely to see if it worsens over time. 
[patient] is there anything we can do about it?
[doctor] the treatment plan will depend on the severity of your condition. we may need to consider medications, lifestyle changes, or even surgery to repair or replace the valve. but for now, we will continue to monitor your heart function and work on managing any symptoms you may experience.
[patient] okay, what about my hemodynamic data?
[doctor] your hemodynamic data was within normal limits, except for the elevated wedge pressure, which can be a sign of heart failure. we will need to monitor this closely and adjust your treatment plan if necessary.
[patient] what will happen next?
[doctor] we will schedule a follow-up appointment for you to discuss the results in more detail and come up with a treatment plan. in the meantime, i recommend that you follow a heart-healthy diet, exercise regularly as tolerated, and take any medications as prescribed. if you experience any symptoms such as shortness of breath or chest pain, please let us know right away.

[doctor] yes, it's important to us that you didn't feel any pain or discomfort. we advanced the olympus video panendoscope under direct vision into your esophagus and we found that everything looked normal. we advanced the scope into your stomach and found that the gastric mucosa looked normal and the pylorus was normal as well. we then advanced the scope into the duodenum and found that everything looked normal there too.
[patient] sounds good.
[doctor] yes, we're very pleased with the results. we didn't find anything concerning and there were no complications during the procedure.
[patient] that's a relief.
[doctor] absolutely. now, if you have any questions or concerns about the procedure or the results, please don't hesitate to ask me.","[doctor] hi there! how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] um, i feel fine, just a little groggy still.
[doctor] mm-hmm, that's normal. i just wanted to go over the results with you. the procedure went well and we didn't find any abnormalities in your esophagus, stomach or duodenum.
[patient] oh, that's great to hear.
[doctor] yes, it really is. we used versed and demerol to sedate you during the procedure. do you remember that?
[patient] uh, no, i don't remember much.

"[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, i'm doing well, thank you.
[doctor] good to hear that. so, i have your test results from your esophagogastroduodenoscopy. your stomach had some inflammation and nodules, and we took some biopsies to send for further testing. also, we found a 1.5cm adenomatous polyp in your stomach which we have removed. do you have any questions?
[patient] no, not really. what does that mean for me?
[doctor] well, the biopsies will help us better understand the inflammation and nodules in your stomach, and the removal of the polyp is a positive development as it was showing early signs of potentially becoming cancerous. the only other finding was a small hiatal hernia in your distal esophagus, which is not a significant issue.
[patient] okay, that makes sense. what should i do next?
[doctor] we will need to follow up on the results of the biopsies once they come back. in the meantime, i recommend continuing your proton pump inhibitor medication and holding your lovenox for five days. we will also place some scds. these are compression stockings that help prevent blood clots in your legs. does that sound good to you?
[patient] yes, that all sounds fine. thank you for explaining it to me.
[doctor] of course, i'm happy to help. is there anything else you want to discuss?
[patient] no, i think that's it for now.
[doctor] alright then, if you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to us. thank you and take care.","[doctor] hey there, how's it going today?
[patient] hey, um... i'm doing pretty good, thanks for asking.

[patient] umm... not really. what does that mean for me exactly?
[doctor] well, the biopsies will give us a better understanding of the inflammation and nodules in your stomach. removing the polyp was a good thing since it showed signs of potentially becoming cancerous. we also found a small hiatal hernia in your distal esophagus, but that's not a big deal. does that all make sense so far?
[patient] mm-hmm, yeah i get it. what do i need to do next?
[doctor] for now, we'll wait for the biopsy results to come back. in the meantime, keep taking your proton pump inhibitor medication and hold off on your lovenox for five days. we'll also give you some scds, which are compression stockings to help prevent blood clots in your legs. does that all sound good to you?

"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after your procedure?
[patient] hi doctor, i'm feeling alright, just a bit tired.
[doctor] that's normal. i wanted to go over the results of your procedure with you. we found an abnormality in your ampulla, which is the opening where the bile duct and pancreatic duct meet. we took four biopsies of it and performed brush cytology to test for any abnormal cells. additionally, we found a mild dilation of your common bile duct, and there may be a possible stricture at the distal common bile duct, although it's likely just an anatomic variant. unfortunately, we were unable to access your pancreatic duct despite multiple attempts due to the abnormal shape of your ampulla. 
[patient] okay, what does this all mean?
[doctor] well, the results suggest that there may be an abnormality in your pancreas or bile ducts, which could be causing your chronic abdominal pain. we will need to proceed with an mrcp, which is a type of imaging, to get a better look at your pancreatic ductal anatomy. we will also need to follow up on the biopsies and cytology results. 
[patient] alright, what do i need to do next?
[doctor] you will need to be npo except for ice chips today, and we will schedule your mrcp for the near future. in the meantime, if you experience any severe abdominal pain, fever, or chills, please call our office right away.","[doctor] hey there, how are ya feeling after your procedure?

"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] hello, doctor. i am feeling a bit groggy, but okay overall.
[doctor] good to hear. your upper endoscopy with biopsy went as planned. we were able to evaluate the source of your upper gi bleeding.
[patient] okay. what did you find?
[doctor] during the procedure, we found coffee-ground emesis, which is indicative of bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract. we took a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the cause of the bleeding.
[patient] i see. is everything okay?
[doctor] yes, overall the procedure went well. however, as with any medical procedure, there are risks to consider. we informed you of these risks prior to the procedure, including risks of bleeding, infection, and perforation. we monitored you carefully during the procedure and were able to manage any issues that arose.

[patient] yeah, it's been happening on and off for a few weeks now.

"[doctor] hi, how are you? i'm going over your test results from the electronystagmogram that we performed.
[patient] hi, i'm doing okay. what did you find out?
[doctor] well, the test revealed that there is prominent nystagmus on position testing when you were in the head hanging right position. this suggests that there may be an issue with your right vestibular function.
[patient] what does that mean?
[doctor] the vestibular system is responsible for your balance and spatial orientation. it's located in your inner ear, and it helps your brain understand your position and movement. based on the test results, it's possible that there is a problem with the right side of this system.
[patient] is there anything that can be done to fix it?
[doctor] there may be some treatments that could help. we'll need to do some further testing to determine the cause of the issue and then we can discuss potential treatments. the caloric stimulation test did not show any significant abnormalities, which is a good sign.
[patient] okay, what's the next step?
[doctor] i'm going to refer you to an ear, nose, and throat specialist who can help us further investigate the issue. they may want to perform an mri or other tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. in the meantime, try to avoid any activities that could cause dizziness or falls.

[patient] oh no, what does that mean?
[doctor] renal cell carcinoma is a type of kidney cancer. we need to do a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.

[patient] i'm doing alright, a bit sore though.
[doctor] that's expected. i wanted to discuss the results of your procedure with you. your colonoscopy looked normal and there was no evidence of inflammation or colitis. however, during the examination, we did identify an 8-mm opening at the anorectal junction, consistent with drainage from a perianal abscess.
[patient] oh, i see.
[doctor] we didn't see any signs of a fistula, and there was no significant perianal reservoir of inflamed tissue or undrained material. i noticed some scars in the perianal area, including a dimpled scar about 5 cm from the anal verge on the left buttock's cheek. 
[patient] yes, i had surgery a few years ago for an abscess in that area.

"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling?
[patient] i'm feeling okay, thank you.
[doctor] i just wanted to go over the results of your procedure. it looks like you had some atrophic dry nasal mucosa, which means the tissues lining your nasal passages are thin and dry. this can cause nosebleeds, which is why we cauterized the left nasal septum to stop the bleeding. we also did a fiberoptic nasal laryngoscopy and found some atrophic laryngeal changes likely caused by your inhaled steroid use for asthma.
[patient] okay, what does that mean for me?
[doctor] well, we recommend that you start using ocean nasal spray and apply bacitracin ointment to the anterior naris to help with the dryness and prevent further nosebleeds. unfortunately, we can't discontinue your inhaled steroids right now, but if that becomes possible in the future, it may help with your chronic dysphonia. we also recommend that you follow up with the department of otolaryngology after you're discharged from the hospital for further evaluation of these issues.

[patient] okay, that makes sense.
[doctor] we'll be going in through your right groin to access the femoral artery. you'll be sedated with iv medication and given local anesthesia to numb the area. we'll be using a #6 french sheath to access the artery, and then a pigtail catheter will be advanced to the aortic arch to perform an angiogram.

[doctor] we'll be entering through your right groin to access the femoral artery. you'll be sedated and given local anesthesia to numb the area. we'll use a #6 french sheath to access the artery, and then a pigtail catheter to do the angiogram. 
[patient] um, what about complications?
[doctor] well, there shouldn't be any complications. the estimated blood loss is less than 10 ml, and we'll use less than 250 ml of contrast. 
[patient] okay, cool.
[doctor] awesome. during the procedure, we'll also do a selective subclavian angiography to measure the pressure gradient. the impression is that there's a moderate grade stenosis in the right subclavian artery. 
[patient] thanks for letting me know.
[doctor] no worries. we'll make sure you're comfortable during and after the procedure. any other questions?
[patient] nope, i think that covers it.
[doctor] alrighty, we'll take good care of you.",2
"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling?
[patient] i feel alright.
[doctor] i have the results from your procedure. you had a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty followed by stenting of the right posterior descending artery.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] during the procedure, we also performed coronary angiography and left ventricular pressure measurement. the angiogram showed mild diffuse coronary artery disease with severe distal left circumflex lesion, and there is a chronic 100% plv branch.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] the angioplasty was successful, and we placed a drug-eluting stent to the ostium of the pda. you tolerated the procedure well without complications.
[patient] that's good to hear.
[doctor] we recommend you take aspirin indefinitely and plavix 75 mg p.o. daily for no less than six months. you will be monitored further in telemetry.

"[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, doctor. i'm feeling better, thank you.
[doctor] good to hear that. i just wanted to discuss the results of your procedure with you. the angiography showed that your left anterior descending artery extends to the apex and has only minor luminal irregularities within the mid-portion of the vessel. your left circumflex is a nondominant vessel with only minor irregularities with normal obtuse marginal branches. the proximal right coronary artery has a focal calcification with minor plaque and luminal irregularity in the proximal and mid-portion of the vessel with no narrowing greater than 10 to 20% at most. your left ventricle is slightly enlarged with normal contraction of the base but has wall motion abnormality involving the anteroapical and inferoapical left ventricle with hypokinesis within the apical portion. your ejection fraction is estimated to be 40%, and there is 1+ mitral regurgitation.
[patient] okay, what does that mean?
[doctor] basically, you had a mild heart attack, but the good news is that your arteries have only minor irregularities, and there is a focal calcification in the proximal right coronary artery. we will start medical treatment, including an ace inhibitor, a beta-blocker, aspirin, plavix, and nitrates. we will also order an echocardiogram to exclude apical left ventricular thrombus and to further assess your ejection fraction.
[patient] okay, i understand. what should i do now?
[doctor] you should continue taking the medications we have prescribed and come back for regular follow-up appointments. if you experience any chest pain or discomfort, shortness of breath, or any other symptoms, please let us know immediately. we will also schedule the echocardiogram for you as soon as possible.

[doctor] great. if you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to ask me anything.
[patient] thank you, doctor.","[doctor] hey, how's it going today?
[patient] um, hey doc. feeling better, mm-hmm.
[doctor] awesome, glad to hear it. just wanted to go over your results from the procedure. your angiography showed minor irregularities in your arteries, but nothing major. your left ventricle is slightly bigger, but still contracting normally at the base. there's some abnormal wall motion in the anteroapical and inferoapical regions and some mitral regurgitation. your ejection fraction is around 40%.
[patient] okay, gotcha. what does that mean?
[doctor] it means you had a mild heart attack, but your arteries are looking pretty good overall. we'll start you on some meds, including an ace inhibitor, a beta-blocker, aspirin, plavix, and nitrates. we'll also get an echocardiogram done to double-check everything.
[patient] ah, got it. what now?

[patient] okay, i see.
[doctor] we also noted that the acl appeared stable, with attachments to the tibial as well as the femoral insertion, but with some evidence of laxity, wear, and tear. the lateral compartment had some evidence of tear to the lateral meniscus, but the articular surface of both the tibia as well as the femur were pristine in the lateral compartment. we removed all the loose cartilaginous pieces and injected marcaine into the portal sites before placing a sterile dressing and stockinet on the left lower extremity.
[patient] i appreciate the detailed explanation.
[doctor] no problem. we estimated the blood loss to be around 80cc and the total tourniquet time was 19 minutes. you were taken to pacu in stable condition and we expect a smooth recovery.
[patient] that's good to hear. what's the recovery process going to be like?
[doctor] you'll need to rest the knee for a few days and keep it elevated to reduce swelling. we'll refer you to physical therapy to help with range of motion exercises and to strengthen the knee. it will take a few weeks for you to fully recover, but you should be able to return to normal activities soon.

[patient] oh, i see. and what about my left leg?
[doctor] we found a functional occlusion of the distal left superficial femoral artery which we successfully treated with angioplasty and a stent placement. the run-off to your left lower extremity is via a patent perineal and posterior tibial artery.

"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling now?
[patient] i'm fine, doctor. a bit tired, but alright.
[doctor] okay, great. so, we have performed a procedure called cardiac catheterization/pci on you. i hope everything went well. before we begin, let me ask you, have you eaten anything in the last few hours?
[patient] no, i have been fasting.
[doctor] excellent, that's what we needed. so, we performed selective coronary angiography of the right coronary artery, left main lad, left circumflex artery, left ventricular catheterization, left ventricular angiography, angioplasty of totally occluded mid rca, arthrectomy using a 6-french catheter, stenting of the mid rca, stenting of the proximal rca, femoral angiography, and perclose hemostasis. 
[patient] okay. what does all that mean?
[doctor] we conducted several tests and procedures to check your heart's condition. we found out that your left main coronary artery is slightly affected in the distal third, resulting in less than 20% angiographic stenosis at the takeoff of the left circumflex artery. your left circumflex artery has moderate disease in the ostium of the proximal segment, resulting in less than 30% angiographic stenosis. the lad has mild nonobstructive disease in the proximal part, resulting in less than 20% angiographic stenosis. the right coronary artery is dominant, but it was septal in the mid-portion.
[patient] i see. what did you do after that?
[doctor] we talked to you about the available options, and you decided to opt for pci. we used a few techniques, such as angiomax bolus, act checking, and oral plavix administration. we then performed a careful balloon angioplasty of the mid rca and used arthrectomy with an export catheter. i then deployed two overlapping stents, which provided excellent angiographic results. we also conducted left ventricular catheterization, which showed no evidence of aortic wall stenosis or mitral regurgitation. we ended the procedure with femoral angiography and perclose hemostasis.
[patient] okay, and what are the conclusions?
[doctor] we found out that you have normal left ventricular size and function, with an ejection fraction of 65% to 70%, and no mr. we also performed successful angioplasty and stenting of the subtotally closed mid rca, which was quite difficult because of organized thrombus. there is moderate disease in the ostium of the left circumflex artery, and mild disease in the proximal lad. we recommend you to quit smoking and continue taking aspirin lifelong and plavix for at least 12 months.
[patient] alright, i understand. thank you, doctor. 
[doctor] you're welcome. if you feel any discomfort or have any questions, don't hesitate to contact us.","[doctor] hey there, how are you feeling now?

[patient] hi, i'm feeling okay, a little sore.
[doctor] that's normal after surgery, especially with the procedure you had. i wanted to go over some details about your surgery and what to expect during your recovery.
[patient] sure, please do.
[doctor] so, you had a bilateral open achilles lengthening with placement of short leg walking casts. this was done to help with your idiopathic toe walking, which you've had since you started walking at around a year old. the surgery was done under general anesthesia, and there were no complications during the surgery. you were given some local anesthesia during the procedure as well.
[patient] okay, i remember some of that.
[doctor] good. your postoperative diagnosis is still idiopathic toe walker, but we're hoping that this surgery will help with that. you'll have the short leg walking casts on for about 4 to 6 weeks and can weight bear as tolerated. you'll need to follow up with me in about 10 days to check on the healing progress and get a prescription for the intended afos, which you'll need for up to 6 months. you might need physical therapy during the healing process as well.
[patient] okay, i'll make sure to do that. what about pain management?
[doctor] you can take tylenol no. 3 for pain, and we can adjust that as needed. you should avoid any physical education for at least 6 months to allow for proper healing.
[patient] got it. thank you for explaining everything to me.
[doctor] of course, if you have any questions or concerns during your recovery, don't hesitate to reach out to me.","[doctor] mm-hmm, you can weight bear as tolerated, but make sure to take it easy and don't push yourself too hard.

[doctor] that's right. we'll check on your healing progress and see how you're doing. and don't forget to get your prescription for the afos.
[patient] okay, i'll make sure to do that. thank you, doctor.",2
"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after the surgery?
[patient] hi doctor, i'm feeling okay, a little groggy from the anesthesia still.
[doctor] that's normal. can you tell me a little bit about what happened with your left achilles tendon?
[patient] well, i was stepping off a hilo at work and i felt a sudden pop in the posterior aspect of my left leg. i went to abc orthopedics and they recommended the surgery.
[doctor] yes, that's right. we performed a primary repair on your left achilles tendon under general anesthesia. the procedure went smoothly and we were able to repair the complete rupture of the tendon approximately 4 cm proximal to the insertion point.
[patient] that's good to hear. will i have to wear this cast for long?

[patient] hi doctor, um, i'm feeling okay. a little groggy from the anesthesia still.
[doctor] mm-hmm, that's normal. can you tell me a little bit about what happened with your left achilles tendon?
[patient] well, um, i was stepping off a hilo at work and then, uh, i felt a sudden pop in the posterior aspect of my left leg. i went to abc orthopedics and they recommended the surgery.
[doctor] yes, that's right. we performed a primary repair on your left achilles tendon under general anesthesia. the procedure went smoothly and we were able to repair the complete rupture of the tendon approximately 4 cm proximal to the insertion point.
[patient] oh, okay. that's good to hear. will i have to wear this cast for long?

"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?
[patient] hi. i'm feeling okay.
[doctor] great. so, i wanted to go over the procedure that we performed today. we removed the hardware and revised your right ac separation. there were no complications during the surgery, and you lost about 100 cc of blood.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] we found that the hardware was loose, causing superior translation of the clavicle implants. we used arthrex bioabsorbable tenodesis screws to recreate the coracoacromial ligaments, which were secured to decorticate and then to the clavicle. we also split two separate areas and then sewed them together for added stability. the fluoroscopy showed no further superior translation of the clavicle.
[patient] okay, that sounds good.
[doctor] great. and we closed the wound in layers and applied a soft dressing. you woke up from the anesthesia without any issues and were taken to recovery room in stable condition.
[patient] alright. thank you for letting me know.
[doctor] of course. do you have any questions or concerns?
[patient] not at the moment.
[doctor] alright. well, if you notice any issues, please don't hesitate to contact us. we'll see you at your follow-up appointment.

[patient] mm-hmm.
[doctor] we discovered that the hardware was loose, which was causing some issues with your clavicle implants. to fix it, we used some arthrex bioabsorbable tenodesis screws to recreate the coracoacromial ligaments. then we secured everything to the clavicle after decorticating it. we also split two separate areas and sewed them together for some extra stability. the fluoroscopy showed that everything was back in place and looking good.

[patient] yes, i have been stung before, and the swelling is pretty significant, but i don't have any anaphylaxis-type reactions like shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. i just want to catch it early before it gets too severe.

[doctor] okay. i'll have you take some tests to check your heart. also, you mentioned having loose stools with green color and some nausea. are you having any abdominal pain?
[patient] no abdominal pain, just nausea.
[doctor] alright, uh, i'll also have you take some tests for your gastrointestinal system. i noticed your blood pressure is slightly elevated, have you been feeling stressed?
[patient] yes, my job has been getting to me lately.
[doctor] that might be the cause of your symptoms. i'm going to prescribe you ativan for your anxiety. use it only as needed. i'll also have you take a stress test tomorrow morning at bad axe hospital. it's important for us to check your heart. you'll come back in the afternoon for a recheck with dr. x. if everything is okay, you can still go on your trip. but if we find something that needs attention, we may have to postpone it.",2
"[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, i'm not feeling very comfortable, doctor. my left leg has been swollen for three years and it's getting bigger day by day. i also feel pain in my left shoulder and back.
[doctor] i see. let me check your leg and shoulder. do you feel any pain when i touch here?
[patient] yes, it hurts when you touch my left shoulder and the left leg.
[doctor] okay. i will schedule you for a venous doppler of the left leg and will have you come back tomorrow for a cbc and a metabolic panel. we will also start you on detrol 0.4 mg one daily and mobic 15 mg per day. these should help with the frequency of urination and joint pain. 
[patient] okay, thank you.
[doctor] you also need to elevate your leg as much as possible and wear support hose if possible. keep your foot up during the day. we will see you back in two weeks to check on the progress.
[patient] alright, doctor.

"[doctor]: hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient]: i'm doing well, thank you.
[doctor]: i see that you came in for a dietary consultation. can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on with your diet lately?
[patient]: yes, so i have hyperlipidemia, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease and i'm also trying to reduce my weight. my husband was recently diagnosed with high blood cholesterol as well, so we're both trying to eat healthier.
[doctor]: i see. and how has that been going for you so far?
[patient]: it's been a bit difficult. i'm used to cooking for larger portions and we're both trying to adjust to eating less. i'm also starting a new job this week, so i'm a bit nervous about how that will impact my diet.
[doctor]: i understand. well, i can definitely help you with some dietary recommendations. based on your height and weight, it looks like your bmi is around 29, which is considered overweight. we can work on reducing your calorie intake to achieve weight loss. i recommend a 1200 calorie meal plan with low-saturated fat sources and moderate amounts of sodium.
[patient]: okay, that sounds good. do you have any tips for reducing my calorie intake?
[doctor]: yes, i recommend keeping a food diary to help you track your calorie intake. i also suggest reducing your portion sizes and choosing lower-fat options. it's important to make sure you're getting enough fruits and vegetables as well.
[patient]: that makes sense. i've been trying to eat more fruits and vegetables, but i'm not sure if i'm getting enough.
[doctor]: it sounds like you're on the right track. we can also work on increasing your physical activity level. right now, you're walking for 20 minutes four or five days a week. i recommend gradually increasing the duration and intensity of your walks to aim for 30 minutes of brisk walking five days a week.
[patient]: okay, i can do that. do you have any other suggestions for me?
[doctor]: yes, i want to emphasize the importance of choosing low-fat selections, especially those that are lower in saturated fats. you mentioned that you've been limiting your food selections based on the low-carb, high-protein craze, but it's important to have a variety of foods in your diet. you can still have moderate portions of potatoes, pasta and meat as long as you prepare them in a low-fat fashion. i also want you to have more moderate snacks between meals to help keep your metabolism going.
[patient]: that all sounds very doable. thank you for your help.
[doctor]: of course. i provided my name and number in case you have any additional questions or concerns. let's plan to follow up in a few weeks to see how you're doing.","[doctor]: hi there! how are you feeling today?

[doctor] so, i see that you have been working hard to follow the meal plan we discussed during the last consultation. can you tell me how it's been going?
[patient] well, i have been trying my best, but i felt like i was gaining weight instead of losing it. so, i started following my old south beach diet, but i know it's not a healthy option.
[doctor] i understand your concern. let's talk about your weight gain. have you been keeping track of what you're eating?
[patient] yes, i have been keeping a record of my meals.
[doctor] i reviewed your food records, and i noticed that you were consuming more fatty proteins than needed, which caused an excess of calories. so, we'll have to make some changes to your meal plan.
[patient] okay, i'm open to suggestions.
[doctor] i have made a new meal plan based on 35% protein calories, 40% carbohydrate calories, and 25% fat calories. you'll have to reduce the amount of protein and increase the amount of carbohydrates slightly. we'll also have to eliminate one snack from your plan. you'll track the grams of fat in your meats as well as added fats. your goal for total fats over the course of the day is no more than 42 grams per day.
[patient] okay, that sounds doable.
[doctor] the meal plan will have 10 servings of 15 grams of carbohydrates throughout the day, divided into two servings per meal and per snack. your protein intake will be 2 ounces at breakfast, 6 ounces at lunch, 2 ounces in the afternoon snack, 6 ounces at supper, and 2 ounces in the evening snack.

"[doctor] hi, how are you doing today?
[patient] hi, i'm doing fine, thanks.
[doctor] so, i understand that you're here for a dietary consultation for diabetes during pregnancy. can you tell me a little bit about your medical history and how you've been managing your diabetes so far?
[patient] sure. i had gestational diabetes with my first pregnancy and i had to use insulin at that time. i'm not really familiar with what ketones are. i walk my daughter to school and back each day which takes 20 minutes each way. i don't really drink much milk, but i do try to have some.
[doctor] alright. i see that your weight is 238.3 pounds, which is a little bit more than your pre-pregnancy weight. your insulin schedule is novolog 70/30, 20 units in the morning and 13 units at supper time. blood sugar records for the last week reveal that your average blood sugar level is 140, which is slightly high. based on your diet history, i think we need to make some changes in your diet to help you control your blood sugar levels during pregnancy.
[patient] okay, what changes do i need to make?
[doctor] i'm going to provide you with a 2300 meal plan that we'll review together. this meal plan will help you manage your carbohydrate intake, which is the food that raises your blood sugar levels the most. we'll also work on balancing your food intake with blood sugar control and adequate calorie intake to sustain appropriate weight gain for the pregnancy of 1/2 a pound a week through the duration of the pregnancy. i'll provide you with the lily guide for meal planning, which will be a helpful resource for you.
[patient] okay, i'm willing to do whatever it takes to keep my blood sugar levels under control.
[doctor] great, i'm glad to hear that. i'm going to recommend that you work with this meal plan with a carbohydrate budget representing approximately 45% of the calories from carbohydrate. for breakfast, you should have three carbohydrate servings. for the morning snack, one carbohydrate serving. for lunch, four carbohydrate servings. for the afternoon snack, one carbohydrate serving. for supper, four carbohydrate servings. and for the bedtime snack, one carbohydrate serving. i encourage you to include some solid protein with each of your meals as well as with the bedtime snack. you should have three servings of dairy products per day to meet your nutritional needs for calcium during pregnancy. i also recommend including a fruit or a vegetable with most of your meals. you should also include solid protein with each meal as well as with the bedtime snack.
[patient] okay, that seems doable. what about my insulin schedule?
[doctor] based on your blood sugar records, i'm going to make some adjustments to your insulin schedule. in the morning, i'm going to increase your 70/30 dosage from 20 units to 24 units. in the evening, i'm going to increase your 70/30 dosage from 13 units to 16 units. if your blood sugar levels are outside of the range of over 90 fasting and over 120 two-hour postprandial, you should call in and let me know. do you have any questions?

[patient] hi, i'm not feeling too good. i have a cold and i just got out of the hospital for dka over the weekend.
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that. can you tell me a bit more about what happened over the weekend?
[patient] yeah, on friday night my blood sugar was 187 at bedtime, and when i woke up on saturday morning, it was 477. i gave myself a total of 70 extra units of humalog throughout the day, 10 of which were injectable and the rest were through the pump. but my blood sugar was over 600 when i went to the hospital later that day.
[doctor] i see. how are you managing your insulin doses currently?
[patient] i have boluses set at 5 units for breakfast, 6 units for lunch and 11 units for supper. my basal rates haven't been changed since my last visit with charla yassine, and they total 30.5 units per 24 hours.
[doctor] okay. i'm going to recommend an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio of 1 unit to 10 grams of carbohydrates. this will help you count your carbs and better manage your insulin doses. we also discussed the option of trying to eat a consistent amount of carbohydrates at meals from day to day and taking a consistent amount of insulin at those meals.
[patient] alright. can you explain how that works?
[doctor] sure. i recommend that you follow with three servings or 45 grams of carbohydrate at breakfast, three servings or 45 grams of carbohydrate at lunch, and four servings or 60 grams of carbohydrate at dinner. this will help you keep your carbohydrate content consistent and make it easier to manage your insulin doses.
[patient] okay, i think i understand. what else can i do to better manage my diabetes?
[doctor] it's important to keep track of your carbohydrate intake and monitor your blood sugar levels regularly. i'll provide you with a carbohydrate counting book to help you track your intake, and i recommend using a correction dose of approximately 1 unit of insulin to bring your blood sugars down 30 mg/dl. we'll also provide you with the lilly guide for meal planning to help you make healthier choices.
[patient] that sounds good. is there anything else i should know?
[doctor] joanne araiza joined us briefly to discuss whether your pump was working appropriately. we gave you an 800 number for the pump to contact should there be any question about its failure to deliver insulin appropriately. and if you have any other questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to me.

[patient] yeah, on friday night my blood sugar was 187 at bedtime, and when i woke up on saturday morning, it was 477. um, i gave myself a total of 70 extra units of humalog throughout the day, 10 of which were injectable and the rest were through the pump. but my blood sugar was over 600 when i went to the hospital later that day.
[doctor] i see. how are you managing your insulin doses currently?
[patient] um, i have boluses set at 5 units for breakfast, 6 units for lunch, and 11 units for supper. my basal rates haven't been changed since my last visit with charla yassine, and they total 30.5 units per 24 hours.
[doctor] okay. i'm going to recommend an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio of 1 unit to 10 grams of carbohydrates. this will help you count your carbs and better manage your insulin doses. we also discussed the option of trying to eat a consistent amount of carbohydrates at meals from day to day and taking a consistent amount of insulin at those meals.
[patient] mm-hmm, alright. can you explain how that works?
[doctor] sure. i recommend that you follow with three servings or 45 grams of carbohydrate at breakfast, three servings or 45 grams of carbohydrate at lunch, and four servings or 60 grams of carbohydrate at dinner. this will help you keep your carbohydrate content consistent and make it easier to manage your insulin doses.
[patient] okay, i think i understand. what else can i do to better manage my diabetes?
[doctor] it's important to keep track of your carbohydrate intake and monitor your blood sugar levels regularly. i'll provide you with a carbohydrate counting book to help you track your intake, and i recommend using a correction dose of approximately 1 unit of insulin to bring your blood sugars down 30 mg/dl. we'll also provide you with the lilly guide for meal planning to help you make healthier choices.
[patient] sounds good. is there anything else i should know?
[doctor] joanne araiza joined us briefly to discuss whether your pump was working appropriately. we gave you an 800 number for the pump to contact should there be any question about its failure to deliver insulin appropriately. and if you have any other questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to me.
[patient] thanks so much. i appreciate your help.
[doctor] of course, take care.",2
"[doctor] hi there, i understand that you're seeking a second opinion regarding cataract extraction. is that correct?
[patient] yes, that's right. i have been recommended to undergo cataract extraction in both eyes, but i'm really nervous about having surgery.
[doctor] i understand your concerns. can you tell me a bit about your past ocular surgery history?
[patient] yes, i have neurovascular age-related macular degeneration and have had laser treatment done four times on my right eye and twice on my left eye. i see dr. x for this.

"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i feel okay, thank you.
[doctor] good to know. i read your medical note from abcd and saw that you have been having some difficulties with repetitive questioning and obsession with cleanliness, is that correct?
[patient] yes, i have been struggling with that.
[doctor] and how has that been affecting your daily life and your ability to relate well in the classroom?
[patient] it has been quite difficult. i feel confused and depressed at times.
[doctor] i see. your mother mentioned that there has been some improvement in the repetitive questioning but you have started collecting old little toys that you did in the past. is that correct?
[patient] yes, that's right.
[doctor] okay. i also see that you will be attending a social skills program in the summer and that abcd has identified two psychologists to refer you to for functional behavioral analysis. that's good news. 
[patient] yes, i am looking forward to attending the program and getting help from the psychologists.
[doctor] great. i also see here that there has been a lessening of tremors in both hands since discontinuation of zoloft and you are now taking abilify at 7.5 mg. how has that been working for you?
[patient] abilify has been helpful in decreasing high emotional arousal.
[doctor] that's good to hear. i will decrease your abilify from 7.5 mg to 5 mg tablet one a day, with no refills needed. we will introduce slow luvox 25 mg tablet one-half a.m. for ocd symptoms. if there are no side effects in one week, we will increase the tablet one up to the therapeutic level.
[patient] okay, i understand.
[doctor] i will also call abcd regarding the referral to psychologists for functional behavioral analysis. your parents will call me in two weeks and i will see you for a medication review in four weeks. your mother has already signed the informed consent and i have reviewed the side effects to observe, including behavioral activation.

[doctor] i see that you recently had an eeg done. can you tell me a little bit about why you had that done?
[patient] yes, my primary care physician referred me for an eeg because i've been having some issues with seizures.
[doctor] okay, well the results of your eeg show that there is some abnormal activity in both of your frontotemporal head regions, more so in the right side. this activity could be related to a potentially epileptogenic process. have you experienced any involuntary movements or seizures recently?

"[doctor] hi there! i see from your chart that you've been experiencing seizures. can you tell me a bit more about that?
[patient] yes, i've been having seizures and they're affecting my daily life.
[doctor] okay, well, we performed a digital eeg on you to get a better understanding of what's going on in your brain. the results show that there is a rhythm in the posterior head region that ranges from 8 hz to 9 hz, accompanied by beta activity which occurs infrequently. additionally, there are muscle contractions occurring at 4 hz to 5 hz which suggests possible parkinson's. there are also left temporal sharps occurring infrequently during the tracing. at one point, there was some slowing occurring in the right frontal head region. do you have any questions about what that means?
[patient] not really, but what could be causing this?
[doctor] well, the slowing in the right frontal head region could be consistent with underlying structural abnormalities, such as a stroke or subdural hematoma, so we would want to rule those out. the tremor is likely a parkinson's tremor, and the sharps arising in the left temporal head region can potentially give way to seizures or may also represent underlying structural abnormalities. in any case, we recommend doing further clinical correlation to better understand what's going on. 
[patient] okay, what's the next step then?
[doctor] we'll need to do some additional testing to rule out any underlying structural abnormalities. we'll also want to monitor your condition and track any changes to your symptoms. in the meantime, we may prescribe medications to manage your seizures and tremors. do you have any concerns about taking medication?

[patient] no, i don't feel any pain, but it’s been there for a few days and it’s making me a little anxious.
[doctor] i understand. i'll start by performing an examination of your neck. i’ll also order some tests to figure out what's causing the swelling. we’ll start with an ultrasound of the neck. i’ll also order two views of the soft tissues of your neck to get a better look.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] the results of your tests are in. the ultrasound of your neck shows no evidence of soft tissue swelling. however, the two views of your neck show asymmetry to the left-sided soft tissues of your neck, which appear somewhat enlarged when compared to the right side. i also noted that the trachea appears to be normal caliber and contour. your adenoids and tonsils appear normal without any evidence of hypertrophy. your airway is patent and the osseous structures appear grossly normal.

"[doctor] hi! how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi! i am doing fine, thank you.
[doctor] so, i have looked at your recent test results and it looks like you are experiencing menorrhagia. i also noticed that you had an ultrasound of the pelvis, which showed that your uterus is enlarged and there are multiple ill-defined fibroids that have replaced it. unfortunately, the endometrial echo complex was not visible due to the fibroids.
[patient] oh, what does that mean?
[doctor] well, it means that the fibroids have essentially replaced your uterus and it is difficult to measure them due to their size and diffuse nature. we may need to perform an mri of your pelvis for further evaluation to see if uterine fibroid embolization is an option.
[patient] okay, what does that entail?
[doctor] uterine fibroid embolization is a minimally invasive procedure that can help manage the symptoms of fibroids. it involves blocking the blood flow to the fibroids, which can cause them to shrink and alleviate the symptoms associated with them. however, we would need to perform additional tests to confirm if you are a good candidate for it.
[patient] i see. is there anything else i can do to help manage my symptoms?
[doctor] yes, there are a few options. we can start with some medications to help control the bleeding and manage the pain associated with the fibroids. we can also discuss some lifestyle changes that may help, such as increasing your physical activity and reducing your stress levels.

"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, i'm not feeling good. i have pelvic pain.
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that. based on your medical notes, we did a transvaginal ultrasound and found that there is a complex cystic left ovarian mass which could either be a large hemorrhagic cyst or abscess/neoplasm. we would recommend laparoscopic evaluation due to its size and complex nature. how do you feel about that?
[patient] i'm not sure, what does that involve?
[doctor] it's a surgical procedure where a small incision is made to insert a laparoscope to examine the inside of the abdomen and remove the ovarian mass if necessary. it's done under general anesthesia.
[patient] is there any other option?
[doctor] we could do a short interval follow-up to monitor the cyst, but given its size and nature, laparoscopic evaluation would be the best option. we can discuss the risks and benefits of both options and make a decision together.

[doctor] alright, take care and we'll be in touch soon.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] um, hi, i'm not feeling good. i have pelvic pain.
[doctor] mm-hmm, i'm sorry to hear that. based on your medical notes, we did a transvaginal ultrasound and found that there is a complex cystic left ovarian mass which could either be a large hemorrhagic cyst or abscess/neoplasm. we would recommend laparoscopic evaluation due to its size and complex nature. how do you feel about that?
[patient] uh, i'm not sure, what does that involve?
[doctor] it's a surgical procedure where a small incision is made to insert a laparoscope to examine the inside of the abdomen and remove the ovarian mass if necessary. it's done under general anesthesia.
[patient] mm-hmm, is there any other option?
[doctor] we could do a short interval follow-up to monitor the cyst, but given its size and nature, laparoscopic evaluation would be the best option. we can discuss the risks and benefits of both options and make a decision together.
[patient] okay, let's do the laparoscopic evaluation then.
[doctor] okay, i'll schedule you for the procedure and we'll discuss the details of the surgery and the post-operative care. is there anything else you would like to ask or any concerns you have?
[patient] um, no, i think i'm good.
[doctor] alright, take care and we'll be in touch soon.",2
"[doctor] hi there, how can i help you today?
[patient] hi, i'm 29 years old and i would like to know the size and date of my pregnancy.
[doctor] alright, let's take a look at your ultrasound report here. it says you have a single live intrauterine gestation in the cephalic presentation, with a normal fetal heart rate of 147 beats per minute. your placenta is located posteriorly without previa, and your cervical length is 4.2 cm. the amniotic fluid index is normal at 12.2 cm, with unremarkable biometric data.
[patient] what does that mean exactly?
[doctor] it means that there is one healthy baby in your uterus, with a normal heart rate and position, and the placenta is in a good position as well. your cervix is also normal, and there is a normal amount of amniotic fluid surrounding the baby. the baby's head and abdominal circumference measure around 31 weeks, and the femur length measures around 31 weeks and 4 days. based on these measurements, the estimated date of delivery is month dd, yyyy, and the estimated fetal weight is around 3 pounds 11 ounces.
[patient] thank you so much, that's helpful to know.
[doctor] of course, let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.","[doctor] hi there, how can i help you today?
[patient] um, hi! i'm 29 years old and i was wondering if you could tell me the size and date of my pregnancy.
[doctor] sure thing, let me pull up your ultrasound report. okay, so it looks like you have one baby in your belly, with a normal heartbeat of 147 beats per minute. your placenta is in the back, which is good, and your cervix is 4.2 cm long. there's a normal amount of fluid around the baby, and everything looks good overall.
[patient] oh, got it. can you explain a bit more?
[doctor] yeah, sorry about that. so basically, you have a healthy baby in the right spot, and your cervix and fluid levels are normal too. the baby is measuring around 31 weeks, and the estimated due date is month dd, yyyy. they also estimate the baby's weight to be around 3 pounds 11 ounces.
[patient] okay, thank you! that's really helpful.
[doctor] no problem, happy to help. just let me know if you have any other questions, okay?",2
"[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, i am doing okay, just a bit worried about my legs.
[doctor] i understand, can you tell me more about your leg symptoms?
[patient] yes, i have noticed swelling in both of my legs recently and it has been bothering me.
[doctor] i see. based on your symptoms, i ordered a bilateral lower extremity ultrasound for deep venous thrombus. the results of the exam did not show any gross evidence of dvt, but it was limited due to your body habitus and edema.
[patient] what does that mean?
[doctor] it means that because of your body size and swelling, it was difficult to get a clear picture of your veins in your legs. however, based on the limited imaging, i did not see any definitive evidence of a blood clot in your legs.
[patient] okay, that's a relief. so what should i do next?
[doctor] i would recommend continuing to monitor your symptoms and if they worsen or you notice any new symptoms, please let me know. in the meantime, i recommend that you continue to elevate your legs and wear compression stockings to help with the swelling.

"[doctor] hi there! how can i help you today?
[patient] hi, doctor. i have been diagnosed with ureteral stricture, and i had an ap abdomen and ultrasound of the kidney done recently.
[doctor] okay, let me take a look at the report. it shows that your right kidney is normal and that there is a double-j right ureteral stent in place, which is good. the left kidney, though, shows moderate-to-severe hydronephrosis, which means there is swelling due to urine backup. they did not see any visible renal or ureteral stones. 
[patient] okay, but what can we do about the hydronephrosis?
[doctor] there are a few options we can consider. one is to remove the ureteral stricture, depending on the severity and location. another option is to place a stent in the left ureter to allow urine to drain more easily. but before we decide on anything, i would like to order a ct scan or an mri to get a better look at the anatomy and make sure there is no other obstruction causing the hydronephrosis.
[patient] okay, that makes sense. what about the calcifications that were seen?
[doctor] they appear to be vascular calcifications, which are common as we age and are usually not concerning. there were no definite pathologic calcifications seen overlying the regions of the kidneys or obstructing course of the ureters.
[patient] alright, thank you for explaining that. what's the next step?
[doctor] i will go ahead and order the ct or mri, and we will schedule a follow-up appointment to go over the results and discuss treatment options. in the meantime, if you experience any pain or discomfort, please don't hesitate to reach out to me or our office.

[patient] what does that mean, doctor?
[doctor] it means that there is some buildup of soft plaque in your carotid arteries, but it is not severe enough to cause significant narrowing of the arteries. this is good news because it means that you are at a lower risk for a stroke. do you have any other concerns?
[patient] no, that's all. thank you, doctor.

[patient] hi, i'm doing well, thank you.
[doctor] that's great to hear. so, today we are following up on the growth of your baby. i have the results from the ultrasound here. everything looks good. the ultrasound shows a single baby in the womb in the head-down position with a normal heart rate of 147 beats per minute.
[patient] that's great to hear.
[doctor] yes, your baby's growth is progressing normally. the biometry measurements show that the baby has a gestational age of 32 weeks and 5 days. the estimated fetal weight is 2,001 grams, which is within normal range for this stage of the pregnancy. the head circumference, abdominal circumference, and femur length are all measuring within normal range.

[patient] yes, the swelling started a few days ago, and then a wound appeared on my face, which has been draining.
[doctor] i see. based on the ultrasound, the region appears to be phlegmonous, which means there is inflammation and swelling. the ultrasound did not identify any fluid collection, but we need to do further evaluation to determine the exact margins of the region. i discussed with dr. xx, and we think a ct scan would be the best next step.
[patient] okay, i understand. what does this mean for my treatment?

"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] not so good, doctor. i'm feeling weak and tired all the time.
[doctor] i can understand. i have reviewed your medical reports and i see that you have a history of coronary artery bypass surgery and aortic stenosis. i would like to know more about your symptoms.
[patient] i have been feeling shortness of breath and chest pain recently. i also feel very tired and weak all the time.
[doctor] okay, based on your reports, i see that you had a transthoracic echocardiogram which showed some findings. your left ventricle is normal in size and dimensions with normal lv function. however, there is concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle with the interventricular septum measuring 1.6 cm and posterior wall measuring 1.2 cm. the left atrium is enlarged, measuring 4.42 cm. there is moderate mitral regurgitation and severe aortic stenosis with a peak velocity of 2.76. i recommend a transesophageal echocardiogram to assess the aortic valve area.
[patient] what does it mean by moderate mitral regurgitation and severe aortic stenosis?
[doctor] mitral regurgitation means that there is leakage of blood from the left ventricle to the left atrium. this can cause shortness of breath and fatigue. on the other hand, severe aortic stenosis means that the aortic valve is narrowed and obstructing the blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta. this can cause chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue.
[patient] what can be done to treat these conditions?
[doctor] it depends on the severity of the conditions. for severe aortic stenosis, we may have to perform an aortic valve replacement surgery. for moderate mitral regurgitation, we may have to monitor the condition closely or perform surgery to repair or replace the valve. i will recommend a transesophageal echocardiogram to assess the aortic valve area and evaluate the severity of the condition. we will then discuss the treatment options and make a plan accordingly.

[patient] mm-hmm, can you explain what moderate mitral regurgitation and severe aortic stenosis mean?
[doctor] sure! mitral regurgitation means that blood is leaking from the left ventricle to the left atrium. this can cause shortness of breath and fatigue. severe aortic stenosis means that the aortic valve is narrowed and blocking the blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta. this can cause chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue.
[patient] got it. what kind of treatment is available for these conditions?
[doctor] it depends on how severe the conditions are. for severe aortic stenosis, we may have to perform an aortic valve replacement surgery. for moderate mitral regurgitation, we may have to monitor the condition closely or perform surgery to repair or replace the valve. i think we should do a transesophageal echocardiogram to check the aortic valve area and see how severe the condition is. after that, we can discuss treatment options and make a plan.

[doctor] i understand. that's why we did the stress test, which i have the results for. it shows that there were no signs of ischemia, which is great news. 
[patient] that's a relief. so what could be causing the chest pain then?
[doctor] well, during the test, we did notice that you had marked chest wall tenderness, which means the pain is likely coming from the muscles and tissues in your chest wall rather than from your heart. it's possible that you may have strained or injured those muscles somehow.
[patient] oh, i see. is there anything i can do to alleviate the pain?
[doctor] yes, you can try taking an over-the-counter pain reliever like ibuprofen, and applying a heating pad or ice pack to the affected area. it's also important to avoid any activities that may aggravate the pain or put strain on your chest wall muscles.
[patient] okay, i'll definitely try that. is there anything else i should know from the stress test results?
[doctor] yes, your blood pressure response to exercise was normal, which is a good sign. overall, the stress test results showed no evidence of heart disease or any other issues. if you continue to experience chest pain, we can look into other possible causes and treatments, but for now, it seems to be related to your chest wall muscles.
[patient] thank you, doctor. that's very helpful information.
[doctor] of course. if you have any other concerns or questions, feel free to reach out to me.","[doctor] hey, how's it going today?
[patient] hey doc, i'm feeling alright, just a little worried about this chest pain i'm having.
[doctor] hmm, i understand. that's why we did the stress test, and i've got the results here. um, it shows that there were no signs of ischemia, which is great news. 
[patient] ah, that's a relief. so, what could be causing this chest pain then?
[doctor] well, during the test, we noticed you had some marked chest wall tenderness. so, the pain is more likely coming from the muscles and tissues in your chest wall, rather than your heart. it's possible you may have strained or injured those muscles somehow.

[doctor] yeah, you can take an over-the-counter pain reliever like ibuprofen, and put a heating pad or ice pack on the affected area. also, it's important to avoid any activities that may aggravate the pain or put strain on your chest wall muscles.
[patient] ok, i'll give that a shot. is there anything else i should know from the stress test results?
[doctor] yes, your blood pressure response to exercise was normal, which is a good sign. overall, the stress test results showed no evidence of heart disease or any other issues. if you continue to experience chest pain, we can look into other possible causes and treatments, but for now, it seems to be related to your chest wall muscles.

"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm fine, thank you.
[doctor] that's great to hear. so, i was reviewing your test results and i see that you underwent a dobutamine myoview stress test. can you tell me why you were referred for this test?
[patient] i have chest pain, hypertension, and type ii diabetes mellitus. my doctor wanted to make sure my heart was functioning properly.
[doctor] okay, that makes sense. well, i have good news. your stress test is negative for dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia, which means your heart is functioning well. your resting electrocardiogram showed a regular sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 86 beats per minute and some nonspecific t wave abnormalities. however, your myocardial perfusion imaging was normal both at rest and with stress. your gated myocardial scan also showed normal regional wall motion and ejection fraction of 67%.
[patient] that's great to hear, thank you doctor.
[doctor] you're welcome. is there anything else you'd like to discuss related to your health?
[patient] no, i think that's all for now.

"[doctor] hello! how are you feeling after your surgery?
[patient] hi! i'm feeling much better, thank you.
[doctor] that's great to hear. i have reviewed the results of your recent pelvis x-ray. it seems that the surgery was successful and the post-surgical changes appear stable. we can see a single screw placed in your left femoral neck and head and two screws in the greater trochanter of your right femur. however, there is a lucency along the previous screw track that extends into your right femoral neck and head. did you experience any pain or discomfort in that location?
[patient] no, i didn't feel any pain or discomfort there.
[doctor] that's good to hear. additionally, there has been removal of the cutaneous staples and surgical clips that were previously present along the lateral aspect of your right hip joint. the deformity related to the previously described slipped capital femoral epiphysis is still visible. overall, the findings indicate a stable-appearing right hip joint status post-pinning.
[patient] okay, that's good news.

"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm feeling alright, thanks.
[doctor] great. i see here in your medical notes that you had an adenosine myoview stress test recently. can you tell me a bit about that?
[patient] sure. i had the test done because i have ischemic cardiomyopathy and had a myocardial infarction in the past. i also had a left anterior descending ptca and stenting done.
[doctor] i see. so, the test involved being given adenosine intravenously while your heart was monitored?
[patient] yes, that's correct.
[doctor] and the results show that your heart rate remained steady at 70 beats per minute although your blood pressure decreased from 140/80 to 110/70 with the adenosine infusion.
[patient] yes, that's right.
[doctor] okay. and were there any other findings from the test that you're aware of?
[patient] the baseline resting electrocardiogram showed that i have an electronic pacemaker depolarizing the ventricles regularly at a rate of 70 beats per minute. also, underlying atrial fibrillation was noted with very wide qrs complexes.
[doctor] i understand. well, based on these results, it looks like the adenosine myoview stress test was successful in monitoring your heart function. we'll be sure to keep an eye on your condition and make any adjustments to your treatment plan as necessary. do you have any questions or concerns?

"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?
[patient] hi doctor, not so good.
[doctor] can you tell me a bit about what's been going on?
[patient] well, i was moving furniture a few days ago and hit my head and back. since then, i've been having a headache and feeling dizzy with nausea and vomiting. my left leg is also feeling weak, and last night i fell to the floor and couldn't speak or move my left side well.
[doctor] that sounds concerning. did you go to the er?
[patient] yes, i did. they gave me some medication and sent me here.
[doctor] okay, let's do a quick exam. can you look at my finger and follow it with your eyes?
[patient] sure.
[doctor] can you smile for me? i notice some weakness on your left side.
[patient] yes, i've been having trouble with that.
[doctor] i see. your pupils seem to be reacting normally to light. can you lift your left arm and leg for me? i notice some decreased movement on your left side.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] based on your symptoms and exam, we did a ct scan and found a right frontal skull fracture with associated hematoma and brain contusion. you also had a spell during the exam where your head turned and eyes deviated to the left, and your right hand twitched.
[patient] oh no, that doesn't sound good.
[doctor] it's definitely concerning. we've diagnosed you with a subarachnoid hemorrhage and post-traumatic seizures. we'll continue your medication and give you a taper for possible alcohol withdrawal. we've consulted with a neurosurgeon, but you won't need surgery at this time. we'll also be doing some neuropsychological testing to assess your cognitive function.

"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?
[patient] i'm doing okay, thank you.
[doctor] that's good to hear. so, i reviewed your latest chest x-ray and it looks like there have been some changes since your previous x-ray.
[patient] oh, okay. what kind of changes?
[doctor] well, there's a right-sided central venous catheter and an endotracheal tube visible on the x-ray, both of which appear to be in the correct position. there are also sternotomy wires present from your recent surgical intervention to correct the asd.
[patient] okay, that makes sense.
[doctor] additionally, there is some minimal bilateral basilar atelectasis seen, which is consistent with your history of atelectasis. however, there are no focal areas of consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
[patient] alright.
[doctor] the cardiomediastinal silhouette appears to be within normal limits at this time and there is no evidence of any pneumothoraces or pleural effusions.
[patient] so what does all this mean?
[doctor] overall, it seems like the surgical correction for your asd has gone well and the placement of the central venous catheter and endotracheal tube are appropriate. the minimal atelectasis is consistent with your history and there are no signs of any new issues on the x-ray.

[doctor] i see. can you tell me about your medical history?
[patient] yes, i have a history of malrotation. i am here for a re-anastomosis of the bowel.
[doctor] alright, let me check your chest x-ray first. we ordered a single frontal view of the chest to check your respiratory system. the x-ray shows that your endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are properly placed. there is no sign of consolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion in your lungs. however, the mediastinum is slightly prominent which could be due to your thymus or the x-ray technique. we also observed a slight increase in the central pulmonary vessels which may indicate a minimal amount of vascular congestion. your upper abdomen also shows paucity of bowel gas. the osseous thorax appears to be intact and symmetrical, but there is a slightly low lung volume which could be due to the timing of the x-ray.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] based on this, i can say that there is no evidence of any significant respiratory issues. however, we need to monitor your condition closely. we may need to do further tests to make sure everything is alright. is there anything else that concerns you?

[patient] yes, i injured it somehow and it's been hurting for a few days now. so i went to the emergency room and they did an x-ray.
[doctor] alright, thank you for letting me know. the x-ray results show that there are some areas of concern. there is a slight abnormality or lucency in the proximal fourth and fifth metatarsals seen in the ap image, which could indicate a fracture. additionally, there is a lucency in the lateral aspect of the calcaneus that is only visible in the oblique image. however, these fractures are not completely ruled out. there is also some swelling in the soft tissue around the calcaneus.
[patient] oh no, does that mean i have a fracture?
[doctor] it's hard to say for certain, but it's possible. the report cannot exclude nondisplaced fractures in the lateral aspect of the calcaneus or at the base of the fourth and fifth metatarsals. i recommend that we correlate these findings with your specific site of pain. we can also start with conservative management and follow-up imaging. i will make a phone call to the emergency room to discuss these findings with them.
[patient] ok, what do i need to do next?
[doctor] we will need to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings in more detail and determine the best course of treatment. in the meantime, i recommend that you avoid any activities that could aggravate the injury and try to keep the foot elevated as much as possible. we can also prescribe some pain relief medication to help you manage any discomfort you are experiencing.
[patient] okay, thank you for letting me know. i will make sure to take it easy and follow your instructions.

[patient] okay, i'm ready.
[doctor] the exam was done in order to determine if there was any spread of cancer cells to the lymph nodes around your left breast. the good news is that only two small areas of increased activity were found in your left axilla, which is consistent with the sentinel lymph node.
[patient] oh, okay.
[doctor] yes, this means that the cancer cells have not spread beyond the sentinel lymph node, which is a positive sign. no other areas of increased activity were seen outside of the injection site and two axillary lymph nodes.

"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm fine, thanks for asking.
[doctor] i have the results of your nuclear medicine tumor localization test that you had done recently. it appears that there are some areas of concern.
[patient] oh no, what did you find?
[doctor] the test showed increased uptake in the left upper quadrant and a focus of increased activity in the right lower quadrant that became more noticeable at 72 hours. the report suggests that these areas are suspicious for distant metastasis.
[patient] what does that mean for me?
[doctor] well, further testing is needed to determine if there are mesenteric lesions that correspond with the iodine-avid foci. i recommend that we proceed with a ct scan to get a better look at these areas. additionally, if the original pathology of the thyroid tumor shows iodine-avid, a pet scan may be necessary in the future.
[patient] okay, what does this mean for my treatment plan?
[doctor] at this time, we need to determine the extent of the metastasis before we can develop a treatment plan. the good news is that there is no evidence of iodine added locoregional metastasis, meaning the cancer has not spread to nearby tissues. we will need to gather more information to determine the best course of action moving forward.
[patient] okay, thank you for explaining that to me. what's the next step?
[doctor] the next step is to schedule a ct scan to determine if there are corresponding mesenteric lesions. we will also need to monitor your condition closely and determine if further testing is necessary.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?

[patient] i have been having some chest pains, that's why i came here.
[doctor] right, well your stress myocardial perfusion scan came back with no diagnostic abnormality on the rest and stress myocardial perfusion imaging, which is good news. however, the scan did reveal mild septal hypokinesis and mild apical hypokinesis. 
[patient] what does that mean?
[doctor] that means that there is some reduced movement in the walls of your heart, specifically the septum and the apex. your overall left ventricular systolic function was low normal with calculated ejection fraction of 46% at rest. this is something we will want to monitor.
[patient] what can i do to improve this?
[doctor] since you are already on plavix, atenolol, lipitor, and folic acid, which are all good medications for your heart, there isn't much more you can do at this time. we will want to continue monitoring your heart function and possibly adjust your medications as needed.

[patient] um, i am doing okay, thanks for asking.
[doctor] so, uh, i reviewed your test results and everything looks okay, but i want to discuss them with you just to make sure you understand everything. how have you been feeling lately?
[patient] mm-hmm, i have been having some chest pains, that's why i came here.
[doctor] right, well your stress myocardial perfusion scan came back with no diagnostic abnormality on the rest and stress myocardial perfusion imaging, which is good news. however, the scan did reveal mild septal hypokinesis and mild apical hypokinesis.

"[doctor] hi there, how are you and your baby doing today?
[patient] hi, we're doing great, thank you.
[doctor] that's wonderful to hear. so, i've reviewed the results of your baby's skull x-ray and i'm happy to let you know that there's no evidence of craniosynostosis or plagiocephaly.
[patient] that's great news, thank you.
[doctor] you're welcome. just to explain, craniosynostosis is a condition where the sutures in a baby's skull close too early and can cause problems with brain growth, while plagiocephaly is a flattening of one side of the head. the x-ray shows that your baby's cranial sutures are open and there are no signs of any skull abnormalities.
[patient] that's good to know. is there anything we should do to prevent these conditions?
[doctor] well, craniosynostosis is usually caused by genetic factors and there's not much you can do to prevent it. plagiocephaly can sometimes be caused by positioning, such as babies always sleeping in the same position, so it's important to change up the position they sleep in and give them plenty of tummy time when they're awake. but in your baby's case, there's no indication of plagiocephaly, so there's no need to worry.
[patient] okay, that makes sense. thank you for explaining everything to us.

[patient] hi, i have been having numbness in both of my legs.
[doctor] can you tell me a little more about that? when did it start and have you noticed any other symptoms?
[patient] it started gradually around november 5th last year. the numbness is in both legs and it feels like a tingling sensation. i also feel like i have lost coordination in my legs.

"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm doing well, thanks for asking.
[doctor] great! so, we got your results back from the stress test with imaging. it looks like you had an abnormal ekg response to stress, consistent with ischemia. can you tell me if you experienced any chest pain during the test?
[patient] no, i didn't experience any chest pain.
[doctor] okay, good to know. the myocardial perfusion imaging was also abnormal, showing a large-sized, moderate intensity partially reversible inferior wall and inferior apical defect, indicating that you have inferior wall ischemia and inferior apical ischemia. did you have any questions about what that means?
[patient] yes, what does that mean exactly?
[doctor] basically, it means that the blood flow to your heart muscle is reduced, which can lead to chest pain and other symptoms. we'll need to do some more tests to determine the severity and extent of the ischemia, but it's important that we address this issue to prevent any further damage to your heart. 
[patient] okay, what are the next steps?
[doctor] well, we'll need to refer you to a cardiologist to further evaluate your condition. they may recommend additional tests, such as a coronary angiogram, to get a better look at your heart and determine the best course of treatment. in the meantime, i would advise you to continue taking your medications as prescribed and avoid any strenuous activity until we can get a better understanding of your condition.

"[doctor] hi there! how are you feeling?
[patient] hi doctor, i have been experiencing pain and restricted movement in my left shoulder for the past 6 months.
[doctor] i see. i have gone through your mri report, and it shows inflammation of the anterior rotator interval capsule with interstitial edema of the superior glenohumeral ligament. the report also indicates flattening of the long biceps tendon as it enters the bicipital groove, but no subluxation. these findings suggest early changes of a hidden lesion.
[patient] what does that mean, doctor?
[doctor] it means that you have a type 1 morphology with an anterior downsloping orientation of the acromion, but no inferior acromial osteophyte. you also have mild tendinitis of the distal insertion of the subscapularis tendon, but no tendon tear. the good news is that your supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor tendons and muscular complexes are normal.
[patient] what is the treatment for my condition?
[doctor] based on your mri report, we will start with conservative treatment options, such as physical therapy, to improve the range of motion and reduce the inflammation. we will also prescribe some anti-inflammatory medications to reduce the inflammation and pain. if conservative treatment options do not work, we may consider surgery as an option.

[patient] what does that mean exactly?
[doctor] it means that there is some damage to the tendons in your shoulder, but it's not severe enough to require surgery. there is also a high-grade partial tear of the long biceps tendon as it courses under the transverse humeral ligament. there is no evidence of a complete tear or retracted tendon. 
[patient] is there any other damage?
[doctor] yes, there is a small nondisplaced posterior superior labral tear, and outlet narrowing from the acromioclavicular joint, which in the appropriate clinical setting is an mri manifestation of an impinging lesion.

[doctor] so, we can start with physical therapy to help strengthen the muscles around your shoulder and improve range of motion. we can also prescribe pain medication or recommend some over-the-counter options to help manage your pain. and if the pain persists, we can consider further evaluation or imaging to determine the cause of your pain.
[patient] okay, that sounds like a good plan. thank you, doctor.
[doctor] of course, we'll work together to find the best treatment plan for you.",2
"[doctor] hello, how are you today?
[patient] i am doing fine, thank you.
[doctor] i see in your medical history that you had an episode of unresponsiveness. can you tell me more about what happened?
[patient] yes, i had a severe headache and took an unknown analgesic, but then i vomited and became unresponsive with stiff arms and a strange breathing pattern. my husband found me and i was taken to the hospital where they found a large mass in my brain.
[doctor] i am sorry to hear that. what was done to treat the mass?
[patient] i was given mannitol and dph and transferred to uihc. i underwent surgical resection of the tumor, and it was found to be consistent with adenocarcinoma. i received 3000 cgy cranial xrt in ten fractions and was discharged to a rehabilitation center.
[doctor] it sounds like you went through a lot. did you experience any other symptoms after your treatment?
[patient] yes, in march of 1993, i had right ptosis, poor adduction and abduction od, 4/4 strength in the upper extremities and 5-/5- strength in the lower extremities. i was ambulatory with an ataxic gait.
[doctor] i see. and when you were admitted in july of 1993, what symptoms did you experience then?
[patient] i had lower cervical and upper thoracic pain, paraparesis, and t8 sensory level.
[doctor] i am sorry to hear that. what were the test results like at that time?
[patient] the mri showed decreased t1 signal in the c2, c3, c6 vertebral bodies and increased t2 signal in the anterior medulla, tectum, and spinal cord. there was also diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement from c7-t7, which was consistent with metastatic disease including possible leptomeningeal spread.
[doctor] that is concerning. what was the treatment plan at that time?
[patient] i was treated with decadron and analgesics and discharged to a hospice center, where i eventually passed away a few months later.
[doctor] i am sorry for your loss. thank you for sharing your medical history with me.","[doctor] hey there, how's it going?
[patient] um, i'm doing alright, thanks for asking.
[doctor] so, i was looking at your medical history and saw that you had an episode where you were unresponsive. can you give me some more details about what went down?
[patient] yeah, so i had this really bad headache and took some pain meds that i didn't know much about. then i started vomiting and couldn't move my arms or breathe normally. my husband found me and i was rushed to the hospital, where they found a big mass in my brain.
[doctor] dang, that sounds rough. what did they do to treat the mass?
[patient] i got some mannitol and dph, and was transferred to uihc for surgery. they removed the tumor and found out that it was adenocarcinoma. afterwards, i got some cranial xrt and was sent to a rehab center.
[doctor] wow, that's a lot to go through. did you have any other symptoms after that?
[patient] yeah, in march of '93, i had some issues with my eyes and arms, and had trouble walking too.
[doctor] got it. and when you were admitted in july of '93, what kind of symptoms did you have then?
[patient] i had a lot of pain in my neck and upper back, and my legs were weak too. i couldn't really feel anything below my chest.
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that. what did the tests show at that time?
[patient] the mri showed some weird signals in my spinal cord and some of my vertebrae. they thought it might be cancer that had spread, maybe even to my meninges.
[doctor] that's really concerning. what was the plan for treatment then?
[patient] i took some painkillers and got sent to a hospice center, where i stayed until i passed away a few months later.
[doctor] i'm so sorry for your loss. thanks for sharing all of that with me.",2
"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm not feeling well. my low back pain has gotten worse, and now i'm experiencing weakness in my legs.
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that. can you tell me a little bit about your symptoms? when did they start?
[patient] my lower back pain started 10 days ago and has been getting progressively worse. it started radiating down my right leg on 12/6/95 and then down my left leg on 12/9/95. by 12/10/95, i found it difficult to walk. on 12/11/95, i drove myself to my local physician, but no diagnosis was rendered. i was given some nsaids and drove home. by the time i got home, i had great difficulty walking due to lower back pain and weakness in my legs, but managed to feed my pets and myself. on 12/12/95, i went to see a local orthopedist, but on the way to my car, i crumpled to the ground due to leg weakness and lower back pain. since 12/11/95, i've also had numbness in my legs.
[doctor] i see. have you experienced any other symptoms such as fever or chills?
[patient] no, i haven't.
[doctor] okay. i see that you have a history of multiple medical problems, including hypertension and a previous myocardial infarction. can you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
[patient] i've also had a cholecystectomy and turp for bph in the 1980s, and i have amaurosis fugax in my right eye. my father died at age 59 of valvular heart disease, and my mother died of diabetes. my brother had cabg in 8/95. i'm a retired school teacher and i've smoked 0.5-1.0 packs of cigarettes per day for 60 years.
[doctor] thank you for that information. let's do a physical exam to see what's going on. i'll check your motor strength and reflexes, and test your sensory abilities.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] based on your symptoms and physical exam, i have several possible diagnoses, including amyotrophy, polymyositis, epidural hematoma, disc herniation, and guillain-barre syndrome. i'd like to order an mri of your lumbar spine to get a better look at what might be causing your symptoms.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] the mri revealed an l3-4 disc herniation that was located more on the right than on the left, compromised the right neural foramen, and narrowed the spinal canal. i think that the disc herniation is causing your symptoms. we can perform a laminectomy and diskectomy to remove the herniated disc and relieve the pressure on your spinal cord.
[patient] okay, let's do that.
[doctor] after the surgery, you improved a lot. we never saw you for follow-up at uihc. how have you been feeling lately?
[patient] i've been feeling much better since the surgery. the pain in my back and my leg weakness have greatly improved. thank you for your help.","[doctor] hi! how are you feeling today?

"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, doctor. i’ve been having some pain in my left knee.
[doctor] i see. can you tell me more about how it happened?
[patient] i twisted my knee while playing basketball last week.
[doctor] i understand. we performed an mri on your left knee and found a few things. firstly, we found a sizable joint effusion, which is a collection of fluid within the joint. we also found some myxoid degenerative changes in the medial and lateral meniscus, which means there is some wear and tear on those areas, but we did not see any definite tears. additionally, there is soft tissue swelling and a partial tear of the lateral collateral ligament complex, which is a ligament on the outside of the knee. finally, we found a high-grade partial tear of your anterior cruciate ligament and an injury to your patellar cartilage.
[patient] oh wow, that sounds serious.
[doctor] yes, it is a significant injury. we will need to develop a treatment plan to address it. first, i recommend rest, ice, compression and elevation of your knee to reduce the swelling. i can also prescribe pain medication if you're experiencing discomfort. additionally, we may need to perform surgery to address the tears in your ligament and cartilage. we can discuss this in more detail after you’ve had a chance to rest your knee and the swelling has gone down.
[patient] okay, that sounds like a plan.
[doctor] lastly, i recommend physical therapy to help you regain strength and mobility in your knee. we will need to work together to create a plan that works best for you. do you have any questions about your diagnosis or treatment plan?
[patient] no, i think you've explained it all clearly. thank you, doctor.
[doctor] you're welcome. we will schedule a follow-up appointment to monitor your progress and adjust treatment as needed.","[doctor] hey, how's everything going?
[patient] hey, doc. i've been having some pain in my left knee.
[doctor] hmm, can you tell me more about what happened there?
[patient] i kinda twisted my knee while playing basketball last week.
[doctor] got it. so, we did an mri on your left knee and found a couple of things. firstly, we found a sizable joint effusion, which is basically a collection of fluid within the joint. we also found some wear and tear on the medial and lateral meniscus, but no actual tears. additionally, there's some soft tissue swelling and a partial tear of the lateral collateral ligament complex, which is a ligament on the outside of the knee. finally, we found a high-grade partial tear of your anterior cruciate ligament and an injury to your patellar cartilage.

"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, i am okay, but i am still experiencing pain in my right knee.
[doctor] i see, let's take a look at your mri results. it shows that you have changes in the lateral meniscus most likely due to the previous partial meniscectomy and re-contouring. however, a subtle undersurface tear in the anterior horn may be present. you also have a mild anterior cruciate ligament interstitial sprain, a strain of the popliteus muscle and tendon, and a sprain of the posterolateral and posterocentral joint capsule. there is a possible segond fracture which should be confirmed by radiographs. 
[patient] okay, so what does this mean for me?
[doctor] it means that you have some injuries in your knee, but they are not severe. we can manage your pain with some medication and physical therapy.
[patient] do i need surgery?
[doctor] at this time, surgery is not necessary. we can try some conservative treatments first and see how they work for you.
[patient] okay, what kind of medication do you recommend?
[doctor] we can start with some over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. if those don't work, we can prescribe something stronger. 
[patient] and what about physical therapy?
[doctor] physical therapy can help to strengthen the muscles around your knee and improve your range of motion. it can also help to reduce your pain.
[patient] alright, i will try those treatments. thank you, doctor.

"[doctor] hey there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi! i'm in a lot of pain and my right foot is swollen.
[doctor] i see. so, the mri shows that you have a tear in your peroneal tendon. here are the details: there is a slight separation of the distal tip of the peroneus longus tendon from the lateral margin of the cuboid bone, which is an avulsion. however, there are no fractures, and the bones are within normal range.
[patient] oh, what does that mean?
[doctor] it means that the tendon that attaches to your cuboid bone has a small tear. but it's not too severe, so that's good news.
[patient] okay, and what's the treatment?
[doctor] we'll start by reducing the swelling and managing the pain. you'll need to rest your foot and avoid putting any weight on it. we'll also have you use crutches for a while. in addition, we'll refer you to a physical therapist to help you regain strength and flexibility. surgery is rarely needed for this type of injury, but if your condition worsens, that may be an option.

[patient] that's a relief.
[doctor] yes, that's good news. also, there was no evidence for acute infarction.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] however, there were some mild, scattered, patchy, chronic small vessel ischemic disease changes, which can occur as a result of aging.

"[doctor] hi there, i understand you've been experiencing ankle pain for the past month. can you tell me a bit more about it?
[patient] yes, the pain is moderate to severe and tends to worsen when i stand or walk on hard surfaces. i also feel tenderness when i touch the plantar aspect of my foot and midfoot region, as well as over the course of the posterior tibialis tendon.
[doctor] okay, we received the results of your mri and it looks like there is tendinosis of the posterior tibialis tendon with tendon thickening, and a possible partial surface tear of the anterior aspect of the tendon immediately distal to the tip of the medial malleolus. the good news is that there are no other significant abnormalities found in the mri. we will need additional imaging for confirmation of this finding, though.
[patient] that's good to know. is there anything else that could be causing my ankle pain?
[doctor] it seems that there is minimal synovitis of the flexor digitorum longus and flexor hallucis longus tendon sheaths, consistent with flexor splinting. there is also edema of the subcutis adipose space along the medial and lateral aspects of the ankle, suggesting altered biomechanics and crural fascial strain. additionally, there is mild tendinosis of the tibialis anterior tendon with mild tendon thickening. however, there is no plantar fasciitis found in the mri.
[patient] okay, so what are my treatment options?
[doctor] we can start with conservative treatments such as physical therapy, rest, and ice to manage the pain and inflammation. we can also prescribe you with orthotics to help with your altered biomechanics. if the symptoms persist despite these treatments, we can consider surgery as an option. in the meantime, i would advise you to avoid activities that aggravate the pain and to wear comfortable shoes with good arch support.

[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that. i see here that you had an mri done on your head. i just reviewed the results and it looks like the mri showed some significant changes in your brain.
[patient] what does that mean?
[doctor] well, the mri found no definite acute findings, which is good. however, it did show that you have prominent chronic cerebral ischemic changes, which means that there is a lot of damage to the blood vessels in your brain. this is consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic disease. the mri also found an old moderate-sized infarct of the superior portion of the right cerebellar hemisphere, which means that you had a stroke in that area at some point in the past.
[patient] oh no, what does that mean for me?
[doctor] it means that you are at risk for having more strokes in the future. we will need to keep a close eye on your symptoms and make sure that you are taking steps to reduce your risk of having another stroke. we will also need to do some more tests to see if there are any underlying conditions that may be contributing to your risk of having a stroke.

[doctor] it means that there is some damage to the ligaments on the inside and outside of your knee. there is also some fluid built up in the joint, and a bone bruise on the front of your knee cap. it's possible that there is some minimal damage to the cartilage on the front of your knee cap as well.
[patient] what can we do to treat it?
[doctor] well, we'll start with some conservative measures to help with the pain and swelling. we can start with physical therapy and prescribe some pain medication. it's important to avoid activities that cause pain or put too much stress on the knee. in some cases, surgery may be required to repair the ligaments, but we'll cross that bridge if we come to it. 
[patient] okay, sounds good. 
[doctor] if you have any further questions or concerns, just let me know.","[doctor] mm-hmm, it's best to avoid any strenuous activities or anything that causes pain. uh, if your job involves standing for long periods of time or heavy lifting, it may be best to take some time off until the pain and swelling decreases. uh, we can also provide you with some crutches to help take some weight off your knee. 
[patient] okay, that makes sense. uh, what about the physical therapy? 
[doctor] uh, physical therapy will help strengthen the muscles around the knee and improve range of motion. um, it's important to attend all of your appointments and follow the exercises your physical therapist recommends. 
[patient] got it, thanks for your help doc. 
[doctor] no problem, feel free to call us if you have any further questions or concerns.",2
"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi. i'm not feeling too good actually. i woke up with numbness on the left side of my body.
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that. when did this happen?
[patient] it started on july 29th, 1993.
[doctor] and have you experienced any weakness, tingling, or visual changes?
[patient] no, i haven't. but a few days ago, i noticed my right hand was stiff and clumsy, and i've been listing to the right when i walk.
[doctor] i see. have you had any recent illnesses or a history of multiple sclerosis?
[patient] no, i haven't. i also don't experience lhermitte's or uhthoff's phenomena.
[doctor] okay, thanks for letting me know. have you taken any medication for this?
[patient] no, i haven't taken any medication.
[doctor] i see. do you have any past medical history or family history that might be relevant?
[patient] i've had bronchitis twice in the past year, but that's about it. my father had hypertension and experienced two strokes at ages 45 and 80, but he's currently 82 years old. my mother has diabetes and is 80 years old.
[doctor] okay, thanks for letting me know. let's move on to the physical examination. your blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate are all within normal range. your motor function is strong, but there's some slowing of the fine motor movements in your right hand. your sensory function is decreased below t2 level on the left side and there are some dysesthesias below l1 on the left. there is mild increase in muscle tone in the right upper and lower extremities. coordination is positive for rebound in the right upper extremity.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] i'm going to order some tests for you. we'll do an mri of your c-spine to check for any spinal cord abnormalities, and also a lumbar puncture to analyze your cerebrospinal fluid. let's also run some blood tests to check for any abnormalities in your blood.
[patient] okay, that sounds good.
[doctor] after running the tests, we found that there was an area of decreased t1 and increased t2 signal at the c4-6 levels within the right lateral spinal cord. the lesion appeared to be intramedullary and eccentric, and peripherally enhanced with gadolinium. there were also oligoclonal bands present in your cerebrospinal fluid. however, all other tests, including the blood tests, were normal.
[patient] what does that mean?
[doctor] it's possible that you had an episode of multiple sclerosis, but it's difficult to say for sure. your symptoms seem to have resolved, but i would recommend that you come back for a follow-up mri of your c-spine, just to make sure everything is okay.
[patient] okay, i'll do that.

"[doctor] hi, how are you today?
[patient] i'm alright, just a little worried about the results of my mri.
[doctor] yes, i understand. we received the results of your mri, and it shows that you have some degenerative disc disease in your cervical spine.
[patient] oh no, is it serious?
[doctor] well, it's not uncommon as we age. the report shows that you have disc desiccation, which is just a fancy way of saying that the discs in your spine are drying out.
[patient] okay, and what does that mean for me?
[doctor] it means that you may experience some discomfort or pain in your neck and shoulders. the report also mentions some central canal stenosis, which is a narrowing of the canal that the spinal cord runs through. this can cause some pressure on the cord or the nerves that exit the spine.
[patient] is there anything that can be done to help with the pain?
[doctor] yes, there are some treatments that can help. we can start with some physical therapy or chiropractic treatment to help with alignment and strengthening of the neck muscles. if that doesn't help, we can consider some medications for pain management or even injections to help reduce inflammation.
[patient] okay, that sounds good. is surgery an option?
[doctor] it's not usually the first option we consider, but in some cases where the stenosis is severe or there is significant nerve impingement, surgery may be necessary.
[patient] i see. is there anything i can do on my own to help with the pain?
[doctor] yes, there are some things you can do at home to help. regular exercise and stretching can help keep the muscles and joints in your neck flexible and reduce pain. you can also use heat or ice therapy to help reduce inflammation and pain.
[patient] alright, i'll try that. thank you doctor.

[patient] it's unremarkable.
[doctor] can you walk for me?
[patient] i have not been tested.

"[doctor] hi, how can i help you today?
[patient] hi, i've been having some pain, numbness, and tingling in my right arm.
[doctor] i see, have you had any imaging done for this?
[patient] yes, i had an mri of my cervical spine done.
[doctor] okay, let's take a look at the findings. so, your vertebral alignment and bone marrow signal characteristics are unremarkable. the disks at c2-3 and c3-4 appear normal. however, at c4-5, there is a disk/osteophyte that is contacting the ventral surface of the spinal cord and may be mildly indenting the cord contour. there is also some narrowing of the neuroforamina at this level. at c5-6, there is a central disk-osteophyte that is mildly impressing on the ventral cord contour. no distinct neuroforaminal narrowing is observed. at c6-7, there is a mild diffuse disk-osteophyte that is impressing on the ventral thecal sac and contacting the ventral cord surface. however, there is no distinct cord compression. there may be mild narrowing of the neuroforamina at this level.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] this leads me to believe that you have a disk/osteophyte at c4-5 through c6-7 with contact and mild ventral cord contour indentation. there may also be some neuroforaminal narrowing at these levels. do you have any questions?
[patient] what does this mean for my arm pain?
[doctor] it's possible that the disk/osteophyte at these levels is causing the symptoms you're experiencing in your right arm. we can talk about treatment options such as physical therapy, medication, or in some cases, surgery. i will also consult with a specialist to get their opinion on the best course of treatment.","[doctor] hi, how can i help you today?

[doctor] okay, did your vision improve at any point?
[patient] yes, it transiently improved to severe blurring while i was being transported to a local er, but then it worsened again once i arrived there.
[doctor] i see, and did you experience any other symptoms?
[patient] while being evaluated, i became unresponsive, even to deep noxious stimuli.
[doctor] i understand. so, you were transferred to uihc for further evaluation. can you tell me about your medical history?
[patient] i had a hysterectomy many years ago, a herniorrhaphy in the past, and i also have degenerative joint disease, which is relieved with nsaids.
[doctor] alright. did you have any family history of medical conditions or any personal history of substance abuse or smoking?
[patient] my husband denied any history of tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use for me. my family history is unremarkable.
[doctor] i see. so, when you were evaluated at uihc, what were the findings?
[patient] my vital signs were 36.9c, hr 93, bp 151/93, rr 22, and 98% o2 saturation. i was somnolent, but arousable to verbal stimulation, and i had minimal speech.
[doctor] okay. can you tell me about your neurological examination?
[patient] my cranial nerves appeared intact, and i also had full strength in all areas except for the ue, which was 4/5 proximally. i withdrew to pp in all extremities.
[doctor] i see. and what was the diagnosis?
[patient] mri brain revealed bilateral thalamic strokes, and transthoracic echocardiogram (tte) showed an intraatrial septal aneurysm with right to left shunt.
[doctor] okay. was there any other imaging or testing done?
[patient] yes, a transesophageal echocardiogram (tee) revealed the same, and lower extremity dopplers were unremarkable. carotid duplex revealed 0-15% bilateral ica stenosis. neuro-ophthalmologic evaluation revealed evidence of a supranuclear vertical gaze palsy ou (diminished up and down gaze).
[doctor] i understand. did you receive any treatment?
[patient] i was placed on aspirin and discharged on january 19, 1993. i continue to take asa 325 mg qd.
[doctor] okay. have you had any follow-up appointments or testing since then?
[patient] yes, i had a neuropsychologic assessment on 1/12-15/93, which revealed severe impairment of anterograde verbal and visual memory, including acquisition and delayed recall and recognition. i also had a follow-up neuropsychology evaluation in 7/93, which revealed little improvement.
[doctor] i see. is there anything else you would like to add?
[patient] yes, during my neuropsychologic assessment, i complained that despite the ability to see type clearly, i could not make sense of words.
[doctor] i understand. thank you for sharing your medical history with me.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?

"[doctor]: hi, how are you feeling?
[patient]: i have been experiencing some issues with my vision.
[doctor]: i see. can you tell me more about it?
[patient]: my right eye has experienced decreased vision over time, while my left eye has remained normal. i also have anosmia from before.
[doctor]: i understand. have you had any other symptoms such as headache, weakness, or weight loss?
[patient]: no, i have not experienced any of those symptoms.
[doctor]: okay, let me do a quick examination of your eyes. your visual acuity has decreased from 20/40 to 20/400 in your right eye, while your left eye remains at 20/30. there is no relative afferent pupillary defect, and eye movement is normal. goldmann visual fields revealed a central scotoma and enlarged blind spot in both eyes, with the right eye being worse. there is moderate pallor of the disc in your right eye. i also noticed decreased facial sensation on the right side.
[patient]: yes, that's correct.
[doctor]: based on your symptoms and examination, i would like to review your medical history and perform further tests. you had a meningioma, which was surgically removed. your vision loss could be a result of this surgery, but we need to confirm with a new mri. we also need to check your blood sugar levels, as you were diagnosed with diabetes a year ago. do you have any questions for me?
[patient]: no, i don't have any questions at the moment.
[doctor]: alright, we will schedule a new mri and blood test for you.","[doctor]: hi, how's it going?
[patient]: um, i've been having some issues with my vision.

"[doctor] hi, it's good to see you today. i understand that you've been experiencing chest discomfort?
[patient] yes, that's correct.
[doctor] okay, well we did a lexiscan myoview stress study to see what might be causing that. during the test, you were given a total of 0.4mg of lexiscan iv injection and 24.9 mci of myoview were injected for stress imaging. we followed the usual protocol for spect and gated spect and the data was analyzed using cedars-sinai software. based on the results, we found that there is no indication of ischemia or any significant epicardial coronary narrowing. additionally, your left ventricle appeared normal in size and functioned well. so, overall, the test came back normal and there seems to be no serious issues. 
[patient] that's great news, thank you so much for explaining the results to me. 
[doctor] you're welcome. if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out.","[doctor] hey there! it's great to see you today. so, i heard that you've been having some chest discomfort, right?

"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, doctor. i'm feeling okay, but i've been having some pain in my left calf.
[doctor] okay, i see. and when did this pain start?
[patient] it started about five weeks ago, right after i delivered my baby.
[doctor] i see. well, based on your symptoms, we ordered a left lower extremity venous doppler ultrasound to check for any blood clots. the good news is that the results came back and there is no evidence of any blood clots.
[patient] that's a relief to hear.
[doctor] yes, it is. however, the ultrasound did show that there are lymph nodes within your left inguinal region that measure up to 1 cm in short-axis. this may be the cause of your pain.
[patient] oh, i see. is that something i should be worried about?
[doctor] well, it's not uncommon to have swollen lymph nodes after giving birth. we'll want to keep an eye on it and make sure it doesn't get any worse. but for now, i recommend taking some over-the-counter pain medication and applying heat to the area to help with the pain.

[patient] no, i haven't.
[doctor] alright, we'll perform the test and see what's going on. after the test, the results showed that your resting heart rate was 96, and your blood pressure was 141/76. your ekg showed normal sinus rhythm, nonspecific st-t changes, and left bundle branch block. after the lexiscan injection, your peak heart rate was 105, and your blood pressure was 135/72. no symptoms were noted. the nuclear myocardial perfusion scan with standard protocol showed a normal and uniform distribution of the tracer uptake. there is no evidence of reversible or fixed defect. your gated spect revealed mild global hypokinesis, more pronounced in the septal wall, possibly due to prior surgery. your ejection fraction was calculated at 41%, with an end-diastolic volume of 115 and end-systolic volume of 68. overall, your nuclear myocardial perfusion scan was normal, but your gated spect showed mild global hypokinesis in the septal wall with an ejection fraction of 41%.

[doctor] um, that's great to hear. so, i see here that you had a screening mammogram done. can you tell me a bit more about that?
[patient] oh, yeah. it was just a routine screening. um, i don't have any complaints right now.
[doctor] okay, and i also see that you had a breast cancer diagnosis in your right breast in 1984, is that correct?
[patient] oh, yeah, that's right.
[doctor] and you had radiation therapy afterwards, is that also correct?
[patient] mm-hmm, i did.
[doctor] okay, got it. and is there any family history of breast cancer?
[patient] yeah, actually, my sister was diagnosed with breast cancer when she was 59.
[doctor] oh, i see. well, i have the results of your mammogram here. so, there are no significant changes compared to your previous mammogram, and there is no evidence of malignancy.
[patient] oh, that's a relief to hear.
[doctor] yeah, it is. however, i do recommend that you come back for annual screening mammography or sooner if you have any clinical symptoms that concern you. do you have any questions about the results or anything else related to your health?
[patient] no, i think i understand everything. um, thank you for your help.

"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm good, thank you.
[doctor] i understand you came to see me for your memory loss. can you tell me more about that?
[patient] yes, for the past year, i have been experiencing a progressive memory loss.
[doctor] can you describe the extent of your memory loss?
[patient] two weeks ago, i was supposed to meet my sister at her house for church. when i arrived, she wasn't there, so i left. i later called her on the phone and asked her if she had overslept.
[doctor] during your evaluation at uihc, did you recall anything about that incident?
[patient] no, i don't remember anything about it.
[doctor] ok, i see. have you been experiencing any other symptoms?
[patient] no, nothing else.
[doctor] can you tell me about your medical history and current medications?
[patient] my medical history is unremarkable, and i'm not currently taking any medications.
[doctor] any history of illnesses in your family?
[patient] my father died of an mi, and my mother had dm type ii.
[doctor] do you smoke, drink alcohol or use illicit drugs?
[patient] no, i don't.
[doctor] alright, let's move on to the physical exam. your vital signs look good, but your blood pressure is a bit high. your mental status exam shows some mild right lower facial droop, poor ram in lue and poor performance on the folstein's mmse. your neuropsychological evaluation showed severe impairment in verbal and visual memory. your hct showed diffuse cerebral atrophy with mild ventricular enlargement. based on these findings, it appears that you have dementia. we will order some more tests to determine the cause of your dementia.
[patient] ok, what do we do next?
[doctor] we will order an mri to confirm the diffuse cerebral atrophy and to rule out other possible causes of your dementia. we will also order a neuropsychological evaluation to get a better handle on your cognitive functioning. in the meantime, i recommend that you make some lifestyle changes to help prevent further cognitive decline. this includes engaging in regular physical activity, eating a healthy diet, and avoiding tobacco and alcohol use.

"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm feeling good, thank you.
[doctor] that's great to hear. so, i reviewed your test results and i see that you have a preserved left ventricular systolic function. this means that your heart's ability to pump blood is normal.
[patient] that's good news.
[doctor] yes, it is. however, we did find mild mitral regurgitation and mild tricuspid regurgitation. this means that there is backward blood flow through the mitral and tricuspid valves.
[patient] is this something to be concerned about?
[doctor] at this time, it's not a major concern. we will continue to monitor it over time to make sure it doesn't worsen. we will also calculate the rv systolic pressure which is currently at 28 mmhg. we will keep an eye on it to make sure it does not increase. in the meantime, it is important to maintain a healthy lifestyle, eat a balanced diet and exercise regularly.

[patient] yes, they last for about 1-2 minutes and occur frequently.
[doctor] have you ever had an eeg done before?
[patient] no, i haven't.
[doctor] well, it's important to get an eeg done to determine the underlying cause of these episodes. we will also need to adjust your medication. you mentioned that you have been taking dph, which is not effective anymore.
[patient] yes, that's correct. the episodes have been occurring even after taking dph.

[patient] i just feel like the food or drink is getting stuck in my throat and it's hard to swallow. sometimes, it feels like it's going down the wrong way.
[doctor] i see. well, we did do a cookie deglutition study on you which showed that you have penetration with thin liquids. do you know what that means?
[patient] no, i don't.
[doctor] so, during the study, we saw that when you swallowed thin liquids, they went down your throat and entered your airway a little bit, but not enough to cause aspiration. we didn't see this happen with thick liquids or solids.
[patient] i see.
[doctor] we also found weakness in the oral phase of deglutition, which means that the muscles in your mouth that help you swallow may not be as strong as they should be.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] the good news is that we didn't see any evidence of aspiration, which means that the thin liquids didn't go all the way down into your lungs. however, we still need to address the penetration and the weakness in your swallowing muscles. we'll need to work together to come up with a plan to help you with your dysphagia.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling?

[patient] hi. i'm feeling okay.
[doctor] i see from your medical note that you had a dobutamine stress test. can you tell me a little bit about that?
[patient] sure. i was having chest pain and the doctor wanted to test my heart. since i can't walk on a treadmill and i'm allergic to adenosine, they did the dobutamine stress test.
[doctor] i see. and what were the results of the test?
[patient] the test was nondiagnostic, but the nuclear myocardial perfusion scan showed normal results. my ejection fraction was 75%.

[patient] i am not feeling well. i am confused.
[doctor] i am sorry to hear that. can you tell me more about your confusion?
[patient] i feel disoriented and i have difficulty remembering the date and the hospital i am in.
[doctor] i understand. have you experienced any weakness or difficulty in speaking?
[patient] yes, i had left-sided weakness and difficulty speaking, but the symptoms resolved within hours.
[doctor] okay. have you had any previous medical conditions that could be related to your current confusion?
[patient] i had two strokes in the past, one in 11/90 and one in 11/91, and i also had a right parietal stroke in 10/87 with residual left hemiparesis.
[doctor] i see. are you taking any medications currently?
[patient] no, i am not taking any medications.
[doctor] do you have any family history of alzheimer's disease or stroke?
[patient] yes, my paternal family has a history of both alzheimer's disease and stroke.
[doctor] thank you for letting me know. have you had any recent weight loss or changes in appetite?
[patient] i have poor appetite and i am a selective eater, but i have not experienced any weight loss.

[patient] my name is [patient name] and the month is [current month].
[doctor] good. can you spell ""world"" backwards for me?
[patient] d-l-o-w.
[doctor] okay. your motor skills seem to be intact. however, there is some neglect in your left visual field. i am going to order some tests to see if there is any underlying condition causing your confusion.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] your lab results show that your mean corpuscular volume is high and you have 20+wbc in your urinalysis. you have a uti and i am going to treat it with antibiotics.
[patient] alright.
[doctor] your vitamin b12 level is also reduced, and i am going to give you vitamin b12 shots for 7 days followed by monthly doses. you also have elevated esr and crp levels, so i am putting you on thiamine, folate, and asa as well.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] your eeg showed some slowing and focal slowing in the right temporal area, and hct revealed a new infarct in the left parietal lobe and an old infarct in the right parietal lobe. the confusion is likely due to the uti in the face of old and new strokes and vitamin b12 deficiency.
[patient] i see.
[doctor] you were referred to vascular surgery for a carotid endarterectomy, but you were lost to follow-up. i strongly recommend that you follow up with your appointments and take your medications as prescribed.

[doctor] mm-hmm, i hear you. have you had any trouble speaking or moving around?
[patient] yeah, i had some left-side weakness and trouble talking but it went away after a few hours.
[doctor] okay, got it. have you had any medical issues in the past that might be related to your confusion?
[patient] yeah, i've had a couple of strokes before. one in '90 and one in '91, and i had a right parietal stroke in '87 that left me with some weakness on my left side.

[doctor] okay, your motor skills seem to be fine. but i did notice some neglect in your left visual field. i'm going to order some tests to see if we can figure out what's causing your confusion.
[patient] alright, sounds good.
[doctor] your lab results show that you have a urinary tract infection (uti), which is probably contributing to your symptoms. i'm going to give you some antibiotics to treat it.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] your vitamin b12 levels are also low, so i'm going to start you on some b12 shots for a week followed by monthly doses. you also have some elevated markers of inflammation, so i'm going to put you on thiamine, folate, and aspirin as well.
[patient] got it.
[doctor] your eeg showed some slowing and focal slowing in the right temporal area, and the ct scan showed a new infarct in the left parietal lobe and an old infarct in the right parietal lobe. it's likely that your confusion is due to the uti along with the strokes and b12 deficiency.
[patient] okay, i understand.
[doctor] you were supposed to see a vascular surgeon for a carotid endarterectomy, but you didn't show up for the appointment. i really think it's important that you keep up with your appointments and take your meds as directed.

[patient] okay.
[doctor] there is no indication of any hydronephrosis or any significant dilatation of the ureters. we also did not find any stones in the expected course of the ureters or within the bladder.

[patient] that's a relief. so what could be causing my face to feel asleep?
[doctor] it's hard to say for sure without further testing or examinations, but it could be related to something like a pinched nerve or even just a sleeping position that caused some temporary numbness. i would recommend following up with your primary care doctor to discuss any further testing or treatment options, if necessary.

[patient] yes, the scan showed that i have a fracture of the frontal process of the maxilla on both sides with displacement with angulation to the right. also, there is slight comminution of the right nasal bone without displacement. soft tissue swelling is seen overlying the left side of the nose. i also have moderate mucosal thickening in both maxillary sinuses, left ethmoid sinus, and marked mucosal thickening in the left sphenoid sinus.
[doctor] alright. based on the ct scan report, it does look like you have bilateral fractures of the frontal process of the maxilla with displacement to the right. you also have slight comminution of the right nasal bone without displacement. there is soft tissue swelling seen overlying the left side of the nose. the mucosal thickening in both maxillary sinuses is moderate, and it is marked in the left sphenoid sinus. did you experience any other symptoms besides pain?
[patient] no, doctor. i didn't experience any other symptoms.
[doctor] okay. i'm sorry to hear that. we'll need to monitor the fractures carefully as they are displaced. the slight comminution of the nasal bone will also need to be watched closely. we'll also need to keep an eye on the thickening of the sinuses. i will prescribe some painkillers and anti-inflammatory medication to manage the pain and swelling, and i will refer you to an ent specialist. they will be able to provide you with further treatment options.
[patient] thank you, doctor.","[doctor] hi there! how are you feeling?

"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, doctor. i am not doing well. i have been experiencing back pain after i had a fall.
[doctor] i am sorry to hear that. we ordered a lumbar spine ct without contrast to get a better look. let me check your results.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] good news, your ct results show no evidence of acute fracture or subluxation. there is also no spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis. the central canal and neuroforamen are clear at all levels. however, there are mild degenerative changes, and there is intervertebral disc space narrowing at l2-3 and l4-5. in addition, there is a probable simple left renal cyst that was incompletely visualized.
[patient] what does that mean?
[doctor] it means there are some normal age-related changes in your spine. the narrowing of the intervertebral disc space is a sign of degenerative changes. there is also a cyst in your left kidney that is likely benign. however, we will need to monitor it to make sure it does not grow or cause any issues.
[patient] is there anything i can do to relieve my back pain?
[doctor] we can start with physical therapy and pain management options like over-the-counter pain relievers or muscle relaxants. we can also consider injections or other therapies if needed. i will refer you to a specialist for further evaluation.
[patient] okay, thank you, doctor.
[doctor] you're welcome. let's schedule a follow-up appointment to monitor your renal cyst and discuss your pain management options.","[doctor] hey, how are ya feeling today?

"[doctor] hi, how are you? 
[patient] i'm a bit sore, but i'm alright.
[doctor] i see. so, i reviewed your ct scan report and it shows that your orbital rims look normal and your nasal bones and zygomatic arches are intact. your temporomandibular joints are also fine. however, there is some polypoid mucosal thickening involving the floor of the maxillary sinuses bilaterally. this means there is some inflammation in your sinuses. additionally, there is some soft tissue swelling seen involving your right cheek. 
[patient] what does that mean, doctor? 
[doctor] it means that you may have mucous retention cysts or just mucosal thickening in both of your maxillary sinuses, and there is also some fluid buildup in the ostiomeatal complexes bilaterally. this could be causing your pain and discomfort. as for the soft tissue swelling in your right cheek, we need to further evaluate it to determine the cause. 
[patient] what's the next step?
[doctor] we may need to perform a more detailed evaluation of your sinuses, such as an endoscopy or another type of imaging. in the meantime, we can prescribe some antibiotics and decongestants to help with the inflammation in your sinuses. we can also prescribe some pain relievers for the swelling in your cheek. 
[patient] is there anything else i can do to help with the pain and swelling? 
[doctor] yes, you can apply a warm compress to your cheek to help reduce the swelling. you can also try using a saline nasal spray to help clear your sinuses. 
[patient] okay, thank you, doctor.

[patient] yes, i was.
[doctor] well, we did some imaging and i am happy to report that we didn't find any acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, midline shift, or extra-axial fluid collection in your ct head. so there is no evidence of acute intracranial disease.
[patient] that's a relief.
[doctor] yes, and we also did a ct scan of your facial bones and cervical spine. we did not find any facial bone fractures, and your cervical spine is normal with no fractures or subluxations.

[patient] i'm not feeling too great, doctor. i fell recently and i'm in a lot of pain.
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that. we ordered some ct scans to see what's going on inside your body. after reviewing the scans, i can see that there are some areas of increased attenuation within the frontal lobes bilaterally. it's likely that you have small hemorrhagic contusions, but it's also possible that you have cortical calcifications. we may need to do a repeat ct scan or an mri to get a better look. 
[patient] what does that mean for me?
[doctor] it means that we need to monitor you closely and make sure that these areas don't get worse. we also found that you have some atrophy and chronic small vessel ischemic changes in your brain. in addition, we noticed some congestion and swelling in your ethmoid and right maxillary sinuses as well as diffuse soft tissue swelling over the right side of your face. 
[patient] what about my spine? 
[doctor] we also noticed some degenerative changes in your cervical spine, but nothing too severe. we'll need to monitor that as well.

[doctor] okay, so the good news is there's no acute intracranial disease, which means there's no damage to your brain, mm-hmm. however, you do have straightening of the normal cervical lordosis, which is likely due to muscle spasms, and degenerative disk and joint disease at c5-c6. additionally, there is a retention cyst versus polyp of the right maxillary sinus. we will need to monitor that, um... do you have any questions about the results?
[patient] no, i understand, um... what do i need to do next?
[doctor] we'll keep an eye on the cyst in your maxillary sinus, but it's not serious at this point, mm-hmm. for your neck, we'll make sure your muscles have time to heal, and we may prescribe some physical therapy, um... you should also continue to take over-the-counter pain medication if you need it, mm-hmm.",2
"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm not feeling too good, doctor.
[doctor] can you tell me what happened?
[patient] i fell several times in the past few days because my legs suddenly gave out. after the first fall, i noticed weakness in my right leg and sometimes needed to use my arms to move it.
[doctor] did you experience any other symptoms during these episodes?
[patient] sometimes i felt weak and pale, and my husband would give me sugar which seemed to help a little. during one episode, i held my right arm in an odd fisted posture.
[doctor] did you notice any changes in your vision, speech, or difficulty swallowing?
[patient] no, i did not experience any of those symptoms.
[doctor] did you seek medical attention after the falls and weakness?
[patient] no, i did not until last night when i fell again, and the weakness did not improve afterward.
[doctor] i see. can you tell me about your medical history and medications?
[patient] i have type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and degenerative joint disease. i had a vitrectomy and retinal traction for retinal detachment, cholecystectomy, and a cataract implant. i take micronase and hctz but stopped taking aspirin six months ago.
[doctor] have you ever had any similar medical issues before, or any family medical history?
[patient] my mother died of a heart attack at age 63, and my grandaunt had a stroke. my father had cancer, and my sisters have hypertension. i do not have any other family history of diabetes.
[doctor] thank you for the information. i'm going to perform a physical exam on you now. can you follow my finger with your eyes? how about your arms and legs, can you move them for me?
[patient] yes, i can move them.
[doctor] during the exam, i noticed weakness in your right lower facial muscles and right leg, but the rest of your exam was normal. i want to order some tests to determine the cause of your weakness, including a ct scan and a carotid duplex. the ct scan showed some ischemic changes in your left caudate, which could be the cause of your symptoms. we also did an echocardiogram that showed borderline left ventricular hypertrophy but no abnormalities. based on your exam findings, it seems like you had a stroke in the right anterior cerebral artery territory, and we will need to monitor your recovery closely.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] um, not too good, doctor.

[patient] well, i fell a few times in the past few days because my legs suddenly gave out. after the first fall, i noticed weakness in my right leg and sometimes needed to use my arms to move it.
[doctor] uh-huh. did anything else happen during these episodes?
[patient] sometimes i felt weak and pale, and my husband would give me sugar which seemed to help a little. during one episode, i held my right arm in an odd fisted posture.

"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, i'm not feeling well. i have chest pain, shortness of breath, and i'm coughing up blood.
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that. we ordered a ct scan of your chest to see what's going on. the scan showed that you have an area of infection in the front of your right upper lung. we also saw some scarring on the upper left part of your lung, and some mild atelectasis or fibrosis in the middle and lower parts of your right lung. there was no fluid around your lungs or any air leaks from your lungs. we need to follow up to make sure that the infection is resolving. 
[patient] do i need to be admitted to the hospital? 
[doctor] not at this time. we can treat the infection with antibiotics and see how you respond. i want you to come back in a week for a follow-up visit and we will do another scan to see if the infection is improving. 
[patient] okay, what about the scarring and atelectasis or fibrosis? is that something i need to be worried about? 
[doctor] the scarring is from a previous infection, and the atelectasis or fibrosis is likely from previous infections or inflammation. it's not something that we need to worry about right now, but we will continue to monitor it.

[doctor] an aneurysm is a bulge in the wall of an artery. in your case, it's in the left internal carotid artery. we'll need to do a cerebral angiogram to get a better look. during the angiogram, you became aphasic and developed right hemiparesis. an emergent hct showed no evidence of hemorrhage or sign of infarct. you were diagnosed with an expressive aphasia and right hemiparesis. spect scans were obtained, which revealed hypoperfusion in the distribution of the left mca and decreased left basal-ganglia perfusion which may represent in part a mass effect from the lica aneurysm. on 3/9/93, we placed a selverstone clamp to stop blood flow to the aneurysm, and it was gradually and finally closed by 3/14/93. you were doing well, but on 3/20/93, you developed sudden confusion associated with worsening of your right hemiparesis and right expressive aphasia. a hct then showed sah around your aneurysm, which had thrombosed. you were placed on nimodipine. your clinical status improved; then on 3/25/93, you rapidly deteriorated over a 2 hour period to the point of lethargy, complete expressive aphasia, and right hemiplegia. an emergent hct demonstrated a left aca and left mca infarction. you required intubation and worsened as cerebral edema developed. you were pronounced brain dead. your organs were donated for transplant.

[doctor] okay, let's take a look at the results. it looks like you have a hypodense mass in the lower uterine segment and cervix, measuring approximately 4.4 x 2.5 x 3.4 cm. there are also multiple uterine fibroids and a prominent endometrium. we recommend a follow-up pelvic ultrasound to further evaluate the mass.
[patient] what does that mean? do i have cancer?
[doctor] we can't say for sure without further testing. the mass is of uncertain etiology, meaning we're not sure what's causing it. it could be benign or malignant, but we won't know until we do more tests. however, it's important to note that not all masses are cancerous. we need to do more testing to determine what it is.

[patient] oh no, what does that mean?
[doctor] well, the cystic lesion in your pancreas is a concern. it measures about 2.2 cm and is located at the tail of the pancreas. we have to consider that this could be a cystic pancreatic neoplasm, and we need to do further testing to confirm. we recommend close follow-up or a biopsy when your creatinine levels improve. we also suggest a contrast-enhanced study using pancreatic protocol or an mri. as for the cystic lesion in your right adnexal region, we recommend further correlation with pelvic ultrasound.

[doctor] your liver and spleen are normal in size and function, and there is no abnormality in the kidneys. the bowels and appendix are also normal, with no signs of obstruction. however, there is left basilar atelectasis, which means that there is partial or complete collapse of the lung tissue. we will keep an eye on that as well.

[doctor] yes, it is. the scan also revealed that your lungs are clear of any abnormalities such as consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. additionally, there is no abnormal lymphadenopathy or destructive osseous lesion detected.
[patient] thank you. so, what could be the reason for my chest pain, shortness of breath, and cough then?
[doctor] there could be numerous reasons, such as respiratory infections, inflammation, or even stress. i suggest you follow up with your primary care doctor to investigate further and to explore any underlying causes. in the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms, please let us know immediately.

"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling?
[patient] not too good. i have pain in my lower right side.
[doctor] i see. i ordered a ct scan of your abdomen and pelvis to check for appendicitis. unfortunately, we couldn't use the contrast material because we couldn't get an iv line. however, the good news is that your appendix looks normal.
[patient] that's good to hear. so what did the scan show?
[doctor] well, the scan showed that there is a moderate amount of stool throughout the colon, but no evidence of a small bowel obstruction or inflammation. we also found no evidence of kidney stones or obstruction. however, we did find a vague region of low density in the left mid pole region that might be a tiny cyst. but we can perform a follow-up ultrasound to be sure. there is also a small hiatal hernia, and your gallbladder seems to have been removed. but, we did not observe any abdominal free fluid or pathologic adenopathy. there is abdominal atherosclerosis, but no signs of an aneurysm. lastly, the scan revealed there is a tiny airdrop within the bladder, so we should check for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infection.  
[patient] i see. what should i do next?
[doctor] i would like to schedule a follow-up appointment to check your symptoms and see if we need to perform a follow-up ultrasound. in the meantime, try to make sure you are staying hydrated and let me know if you experience any urinary tract infection symptoms such as pain or burning while urinating, or frequent urination.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling?

[doctor] i understand. you have a history of pneumonia, right?
[patient] yes, i had pneumonia before.
[doctor] okay, we did a ct angiography of your chest with contrast. the good news is that there is no evidence of any acute pulmonary arterial embolism.

"[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, i am not feeling well. i have right-sided abdominal pain with nausea and fever.
[doctor] i am sorry to hear that. we performed a ct scan of your abdomen and pelvis and the result shows that you have acute appendicitis. it means your appendix is inflamed and needs to be removed.
[patient] do i need surgery?
[doctor] yes, we need to remove the inflamed appendix through surgery. if we don't remove it, it can rupture and cause a serious infection in your body. but don't worry, it's a routine surgery and you will be under anesthesia the whole time.
[patient] how long will it take me to recover?
[doctor] recovery time varies from person to person, but most people can go home the next day and resume normal activities within one to two weeks. you will need to take it easy for a few days after the surgery and avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activities.

"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] uh, not so good, doctor. i have left-sided weakness.
[doctor] i see. can you tell me a bit more about that? when did it start?
[patient] it started on july 4th, 1995. i also had severe dysarthria and aphasia.
[doctor] and what symptoms did you have before that?
[patient] i had fevers, chills, diaphoresis, anorexia, urinary frequency, myalgias, and generalized weakness for seven days.
[doctor] okay, did you go to a hospital for that?
[patient] yes, i was admitted to a local hospital on june 30th, 1995.
[doctor] and were you diagnosed with anything there?
[patient] yes, blood and urine cultures were positive for staphylococcus aureus, oxacillin sensitive. they gave me antibiotics according to sensitivity.
[doctor] i see. and did they do any other tests?
[patient] yes, they did a transthoracic echocardiogram on july 3rd, 1995, which revealed normal left ventricular function and a damaged mitral valve with regurgitation. and on that same day, i had an hct, which showed mild attenuated signal in the right hemisphere.
[doctor] okay. and how about your medical history? do you have any pre-existing conditions?
[patient] yes, i had a heart murmur diagnosed when i was five years old.
[doctor] i see. and did you have any family history of medical conditions?
[patient] no, my family history is unremarkable.
[doctor] alright. and do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any illicit drugs?
[patient] no, i don't.
[doctor] okay. let's take a look at your current physical exam. i can see that you have left-sided weakness, dysarthric speech, and sparse verbal output. your pupils are 3/3 decreasing to 2/2 on exposure to light, and you have a conjugate gaze preference toward the right. you also have a right hemianopia by visual threat testing, left lower facial weakness, and your tongue is deviated to the left. your left corneal response is weak, and your motor sensation is dense left flaccid hemiplegia. you also have a weak gag response bilaterally, and your reflexes are 2/3 throughout, with left ankle clonus and a left babinski sign.
[patient] yes, that's right.
[doctor] i can see that you had a large rmca stroke with mass shift on july 6th, 1995, and you underwent an emergent left craniectomy and duraplasty. later, you underwent a mitral valve replacement on july 11th, 1995, with a st. judes valve. you had a post-operative recovery that was complicated by pneumonia, pericardial effusion, and dysphagia. you required temporary peg placement for feeding. on october 18th, 1996, your neurosurgery clinic visit noted that you can ambulate without assistance with the use of a leg brace to prevent left foot drop. your proximal lle strength was rated at a 4, and your lue was plegic. you also had a seizure six days prior to your 10/18/96 evaluation.
[patient] yes, that's all correct.
[doctor] i see. based on your medical history and physical exam, i believe that you had a large stroke that caused your left-sided weakness and other symptoms. i would like to do some more tests to assess the extent of the damage and to see if we can find any treatments that might help with your recovery.

[doctor]: i understand, let me explain what we saw. your liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys all look normal, which is great news. we did find that you have gallstones, which is called cholelithiasis, but that may not be causing your current pain. 
[patient]: okay, what about the swelling at the site of the ileostomy?
[doctor]: we did see postsurgical changes of a left lower quadrant ileostomy and no evidence of obstruction. the right lower quadrant ileostomy is unchanged. however, we did find a 3.4 cm x 2.5 cm fluid collection in the left pelvic area near the anastomosis site. this could be a pelvic abscess, so we need to further investigate that.

[patient] oh, that's a relief.
[doctor] yes, it is. however, we did find two cystic lesions in your left kidney. they need further evaluation to determine their nature. you may need to get an ultrasound or contrast study.
[patient] what does that mean, doctor? is it serious?
[doctor] it's not necessarily serious at this point, but it's better to rule out any possibility of malignancy. we need to conduct further tests to determine the nature of the cystic lesions.

[patient] a ct scan of my abdomen and pelvis without contrast, stone protocol.
[doctor] okay, let me take a look at the results. it looks like there is some mild left renal pelvis and proximal ureteral dilatation with a small amount of left perinephric stranding. we did not find any intrarenal stone bilaterally, or along the course of the left ureter, and no stone in the bladder. however, we cannot exclude the possibility of recent stone passage, although the findings are technically indeterminate. there are diverticula, and moderate stool in the colon, but no ct evidence of acute diverticulitis. the appendix is normal, and there are degenerative changes of the lumbar spine.

[patient]: what does that mean?
[doctor]: the lymph nodes may be reactive, meaning your body is fighting off an infection, but we need to make sure there isn't an early neoplastic process. we also found a 13mm fluid collection in the anterior pararenal space of uncertain cause. you have diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis, and mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation due to your past cholecystectomy. lastly, you have osteopenia and degenerative changes in your spine and pelvis.

[doctor] it's important to continue to monitor your symptoms and let us know if you experience any changes or new symptoms. we may also advise you to make some changes to your diet or lifestyle to support your liver and kidney health. we'll discuss these options further at your follow-up appointments.
[patient] alright, thank you for your help.
[doctor] no problem at all. we'll do everything we can to help you through this. let's schedule those follow-up tests and appointments so we can get a better sense of what's going on.",2
"[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi doctor, i am feeling awful. i have been having nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and fever. also, my right upper quadrant has been hurting for a day now.
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that. i understand you had a ct scan of your abdomen and pelvis. did you get the results?
[patient] yes, the er doctor told me that the results are normal.
[doctor] that's great news! the ct scan did not show any evidence of acute appendicitis, nephro-/ureterolithiasis or acute cholecystitis.
[patient] that's a relief. but what could be causing my symptoms then?
[doctor] there could be a number of causes for your symptoms, such as a viral infection, food poisoning or gastroenteritis. i recommend that you continue to rest and stay hydrated. you can take over-the-counter medications to manage your symptoms. if your symptoms persist or worsen, please come back and see me for further evaluation.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?

"[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm feeling fine, thank you.
[doctor] that's good to hear. i just wanted to go over the results of your recent ct scan. it looks like there were no complications identified regarding your endoluminal aortoiliac graft repair, and the findings are stable compared to the previous study in 2004.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] there is a stable mild aneurysm of the abdominal aortic aneurysm, centered roughly at the renal artery level. there is also advanced atrophy of the left kidney, but no other acute findings were noted. do you have any questions about the results?
[patient] no, i don't think so.","[doctor] alright then, um, i just want to make sure that you are aware of the results. it's great to hear that everything is stable and no acute findings were noted. do you need any more information about your kidney atrophy or the mild aneurysm?

"[doctor] hello, how are you doing? i have received the results of your cardiac ct scan, and i would like to go over them with you.
[patient] hi, i'm doing fine. okay, please go ahead.
[doctor] so, the results show that you have mild coronary artery disease, but your left ventricular ejection fraction is still preserved at 69%. this indicates that your heart is still pumping blood efficiently.
[patient] okay, what does this mean for me?
[doctor] we will need to manage your condition aggressively with a combination of lifestyle modifications and medication. this includes a healthy diet and regular exercise, as well as taking statins to help lower your cholesterol levels.
[patient] is there anything else i need to be aware of?
[doctor] your coronary calcium score was calculated as 79, which indicates that there is at least mild atherosclerosis within your coronary vessels. we will need to monitor your condition closely and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan. do you have any questions or concerns?
[patient] no, i think i understand. thank you for explaining everything to me.
[doctor] you're welcome. we will schedule a follow-up appointment soon to discuss your treatment plan in more detail. take care.","[doctor] hey there, how you holding up? so, i got your cardiac ct scan results and i wanna go over them with you if it's cool.
[patient] hey, i'm alright. sure, go ahead.
[doctor] so, the results show that you've got mild coronary artery disease, but your left ventricular ejection fraction is still good at 69%. that means your heart's pumping blood like a champ.
[patient] alright, what's the deal with that?
[doctor] we're gonna have to hit your condition hard with a mix of lifestyle changes and medication. this means eating healthy, working out regularly, and taking statins to help lower your cholesterol levels.
[patient] any other important stuff i should know?
[doctor] your coronary calcium score came out to 79, which means there's at least some atherosclerosis within your coronary vessels. we're gonna have to keep a close eye on you and make any changes to your treatment as needed. got any questions or worries?
[patient] no, i think i'm good. thanks for explaining everything to me.
[doctor] not a problem. we'll have to schedule another appointment soon to go over your treatment plan in more depth. take care!",2
"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, i'm here because i have been experiencing shortness of breath.
[doctor] okay, let me take a look at your chest x-ray here. hmm, it looks like there has been a development of a moderate left-sided pneumothorax with almost complete collapse of the left upper lobe.
[patient] what does that mean?
[doctor] it means that there is air leaking into the space between your lung and chest wall, causing your left lung to partially collapse. we need to keep an eye on this and make sure it doesn't get worse. the rest of the exam shows no acute issues, and your left central line is properly placed and stable.
[patient] is there anything that can be done about this?
[doctor] we will need to monitor the pneumothorax closely to see if it resolves on its own or if we need to intervene. in the meantime, i recommend resting and avoiding any strenuous activity. we will follow up with another chest x-ray to see if there are any changes.
[patient] okay, thank you.
[doctor] of course, i will also consult with a specialist to determine the best course of action moving forward.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?

[doctor] i see. can you tell me more about your symptoms? when did it start?
[patient] i have been having increasing gait difficulty for the past two years, which i attributed to generalized weakness. i also experience occasional visual obscurations. a few days ago, i went to a local physician for clumsiness of my right hand and falling.
[doctor] did they run any tests or do any scans?
[patient] yes, they did an hct and mri brain, which revealed bilateral posterior clinoid masses.
[doctor] i see. can you tell me about your medical history and any medications you are taking?
[patient] i have a history of obesity, vbg in 1990, a-fib, htn, hypothyroidism, hypercholesterolemia, briquet's syndrome, and cll. i am taking colace, quinidine, synthroid, lasix, lanoxin, kcl, elavil, and tenormin.

[patient] my father died of a heart attack at the age of 61.
[doctor] thank you for that information. now, let's do a physical exam. your vitals seem unremarkable. i noticed that you have mild decreased pp about the right upper and lower face and diffusely about the left upper and lower face. did the neurosurgery notes mention anything about this?
[patient] yes, they did.
[doctor] okay. i will refer you to neuro-ophthalmology for further evaluation. in the meantime, we will order a cerebral angiography to get a better look at your aneurysm. we will also schedule you for a left frontotemporal craniotomy and explore the left aneurysm. it seems like the aneurysm neck went into the cavernous sinus and was unclippable, so it was wrapped. you may experience headaches after the surgery, but we will monitor your symptoms and provide you with pain management if needed.

[doctor] during my exam, i noticed that you have decreased corneal reflex, decreased gag response on the left, and a uvula that deviates to the right. you also have decreased sensation on the left side of your face, and horizontal nystagmus on leftward gaze. based on your symptoms and exam findings, i suspect that you had a left vertebral artery dissection that resulted in a left lateral medullary stroke. you were placed on heparin and then coumadin for 3 months and were then switched to asa for 1 year. an otolaryngologic evaluation in 10/96 showed that you had true left vocal cord paralysis, and a prosthesis was made for you.
[patient] okay, thank you for explaining that to me.
[doctor] you're welcome. please take your medication as prescribed and follow-up with me if you have any additional concerns or symptoms.",2
"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm doing alright, thanks.
[doctor] so, we got the results back from your recent carotid and cerebral arteriograms. it looks like there's complete occlusion of the left common carotid artery about 3 centimeters distal to its origin. did you have any symptoms before this procedure?
[patient] no, i haven't noticed anything unusual.
[doctor] that's good to hear. we also identified mild stenosis of the right internal carotid artery at about 20%, but the bilateral vertebral arteries are patent and we didn't find any significant disease in the anterior cerebral vessels. you tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications during or after the procedure.
[patient] alright, thank you for letting me know.
[doctor] of course. we'll keep monitoring your condition and if you experience any symptoms or if there's any change in your condition, please let us know.","[doctor] hey, how are you feeling today?

"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i am good, thank you.
[doctor] i wanted to talk to you about the results of your recent cardiolite treadmill exercise stress test.
[patient] oh, sure.
[doctor] the test shows normal myocardial perfusion imaging, which is great news. it suggests a low probability for significant coronary artery disease.
[patient] that's a relief to hear.
[doctor] yes, it is. during the test, you exercised on the treadmill to maximum tolerance and achieved a peak heart rate of 137 beats per minute with a workload of 2.3 mets. your blood pressure response was normal, and you did not complain of any symptoms during the test. other than the right bundle branch block that was present at rest, no other significant electrographic abnormalities were observed.
[patient] i see.
[doctor] we also performed myocardial perfusion imaging at rest and at peak pharmacological effect. the spect images demonstrate fairly homogeneous tracer distribution throughout the myocardium with no overt evidences of fixed and/or reperfusion defect. the left ventricular ejection fraction was normal and estimated to be 78%.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] overall, the quality of the study was fair. based on these findings, you are at low risk for coronary artery disease. however, we will continue to monitor your condition and manage your diabetes mellitus and hypertension.

"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?
[patient] i'm not doing well, doctor. i have been experiencing headaches and i'm worried that it could be something serious.
[doctor] i understand. i ordered a bilateral carotid ultrasound for you to investigate the cause of your headaches. the results show that there is bilateral hard plaque at the bifurcation, which is more pronounced on the left side. there is at least 50% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery at its bifurcation, and i recommend a follow-up cta for more precise measurements.
[patient] what does that mean, doctor?
[doctor] essentially, there are blockages in the carotid arteries in your neck, which could be the cause of your headaches. the blockage on the left side is more significant than the right. we need to investigate further to determine the severity of the blockage and plan for further treatment if necessary.
[patient] what kind of treatment?
[doctor] depending on the severity, we may need to consider a surgical procedure to remove the blockage or stent placement to widen the artery. however, we won't know for sure until we get the results of the follow-up cta.

[doctor] great, and are you experiencing any breast pain or discomfort?
[patient] no, not at all.
[doctor] that's good to hear. i see here that there are some calcifications in your right breast. we recommend some additional views for further evaluation. it's important to rule out any potential issues.

[doctor] we will need to take some spot magnification in the mlo and cc views of your right breast to get a closer look at the calcifications. we want to make sure everything is okay.
[patient] okay, should i be worried?
[doctor] not necessarily. it's important to get a closer look to rule out any potential issues, but it doesn't necessarily mean there is anything to be worried about. we just want to be thorough.

[doctor] not at the moment, we just need to schedule you for those additional views. i will go ahead and order that for you. and just so you know, a certain percentage of cancers, probably 10% to 15%, will not be identified by mammography. lack of radiographic evidence of malignancy should not delay a biopsy if a clinically suspicious mass is present.

"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] i'm feeling okay, just a little sore at the groin area.
[doctor] that's normal. so we performed a selective ascending aortic arch angiogram, selective left and right common carotid artery angiogram, selective left subclavian artery angiogram, and right iliac angio with runoff. we also did bilateral cerebral angiograms via right and left common carotid artery injections. 
[patient] okay, and what did you find?
[doctor] we found that you have a type 2 aortic arch, which is a common variation. your left subclavian artery and left vertebral artery are patent, which is good. however, you have a moderate stenosis in the left internal carotid artery with ulceration, and a heavily calcified 60-70% stenosis in the right common carotid artery. we did not treat these with summed left-to-right cross over flow. 
[patient] what does that mean?
[doctor] it means that we did not perform any interventions to treat the stenosis during the procedure. we will continue with your current medications, aspirin, plavix, and coumadin to maintain an inr of 2. we will also schedule a carotid duplex follow-up to monitor the progression of the stenosis.

[doctor] good to hear. let's talk about your test results. the mammogram and ultrasound shows that there is a mixed solid and cystic lesion at the 2 o'clock position of your left breast, which we biopsied. the core biopsies were sent to the laboratory for analysis. meanwhile, we also found a small ovoid mass in the left shoulder that could be a fibrotic change or a lipoma. did you feel any discomfort during the procedure?
[patient] no, i did not feel anything.
[doctor] that's great. there was some bleeding during the biopsy and resulted in a localized hematoma, but we were able to manage it with pressure and ice packing. you were monitored for about 30 minutes after the biopsy, and we discharged you in good condition. we will wait for the pathology report to come back before deciding on the next steps. we classified the mammogram findings as birads 4, which means suspicious findings. we need to keep a close eye on this and may require further testing. do you have any questions or concerns?

[doctor] your mmpi-2 profile is technically valid and interpretable. the modified welsh code suggests that you may be moody, irritable, and have difficulty trusting others. you may tend to keep others at a distance, but still feel insecure and dependent. a bipolar diagnosis is a possibility, and there's a chance that you may have an antisocial personality disorder, although i'm less confident in that diagnosis. your mmpi-2 content scale scores indicate some mild depression and family stressors, and there's a single clinical elevation on addiction admission, which is consistent with what you told me during your interview.
[patient] okay, what does all of that mean?
[doctor] it means that we need to take a closer look at your symptoms and figure out the best way to treat them. i'd like to refer you to a psychiatrist who can evaluate you for bipolar disorder and other mood disorders. we can also refer you to a therapist who can help you work through any depression or family stressors that you're experiencing. additionally, we can explore other treatment options besides medication, such as cognitive behavioral therapy.
[patient] okay, that sounds like a good plan.
[doctor] great. do you have any questions or concerns?
[patient] no, i think i understand everything.
[doctor] alright, we'll get those referrals set up for you. thank you for coming in today.","[doctor] hey there, mr. abcd! how's it going?
[patient] um, i'm doing alright.
[doctor] so, i wanted to chat with you about your psychological assessment results. based on your self-report, it's possible you have adhd. but when we did the conners cpt-ii test, it seemed like you don't have attention problems. so, it's probably not adhd.
[patient] oh, okay.

[doctor] i understand. let's take a look. during the exam, i found that your baby's anterior chamber space, which includes the cornea, iris, lens, and pupils, was unremarkable in each eye. the ocular adnexal spaces are looking good in each eye as well.

[doctor] i did use cyclomydril to dilate the pupils in each eye, and the ocular disc space was normal in size and shape with a pink color and clear margins. the macular spaces also appeared normal for your baby's age, and i didn't see any dilated blood vessels in each eye.
[patient] so, what's the problem?
[doctor] unfortunately, i did notice that the peripheral retina was still hazy, and i can't rule out retinopathy of prematurity at this time. given these findings, i'd like to recheck your baby's eyes in two weeks.

[doctor] no problem at all. if you have any questions or concerns, uh, don't hesitate to reach out to me.",2

[doctor]: i see. can you tell me more about the pain? is it continuous or intermittent?
[patient]: it is intermittent and occurs on both sides. the pain is not associated with movement, but it increases with activity. it usually lasts for half-a-day, and sometimes i feel like vomiting because of the pain.
[doctor]: have you tried anything for the pain?
[patient]: i have tried lactaid, and it helped initially, but the pain returned. i also changed my diet and tried pepcid ac, but nothing seems to work.

[patient]: oh my goodness. what are my options?
[doctor]: the literature on this type of tumor is not clear as to the optimal treatment protocol. however, some people have survived for up to 25 years after diagnosis with different treatments. we can discuss radiation therapy and chemotherapy, as well as other options in detail.

[doctor] based on the results of your exam and tests, it appears that you have creutzfeldt-jakob disease (heidenhaim variant). unfortunately, this is a very serious and rare disease that affects the brain. there is no cure for this disease, but we can provide supportive care to help manage your symptoms.
[patient] oh no.
[doctor] i'm sorry to have to give you this news. we'll do everything we can to make you as comfortable as possible.","[doctor] hello, can you tell me your name?
[patient] um, yeah, i'm [patient's name].
[doctor] okay, [patient's name], can you tell me what's been going on with you lately?
[patient] um, yeah, i've been experiencing some memory loss and uh, difficulty with concentration and calculation.
[doctor] can you tell me when you first noticed these symptoms?
[patient] mm-hmm, my family first noticed something was wrong when we were playing a game in colorado. i was chosen to be the ""assassin"" and my children hid a toy gun in my bag. security at the airport found it and uh, i was surrounded, searched, and interrogated. after that, i seemed unusually flustered and disoriented.
[doctor] okay, and what kind of work did you do before this?
[patient] oh, uh, i worked at a florist shop, but i had to quit because i was having difficulty carrying out my usual tasks of flower arranging and operating the cash register.
[doctor] i see. and have you been evaluated by a neurologist?
[patient] oh, yeah, i was evaluated by a local neurologist in november and december. they did some tests and the working diagnosis was ""dementia of the alzheimer's type.""
[doctor] okay. have you noticed any other symptoms?
[patient] yes, i've been feeling emotionally unstable and i tend to veer toward the right when i walk. i also have difficulty finding words and writing sentences.
[doctor] okay, i'm going to do a physical exam to check your motor and sensory functions. after that, i'll order some tests to see what might be causing your symptoms.

"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?
[patient] hi, i'm not feeling great, doctor.
[doctor] i understand. can you tell me more about the numbness on your right side? how long has that been going on?
[patient] it's been getting worse over the past three months, and now i can't feel any pain on my right side.
[doctor] i see. any issues with your balance?
[patient] yes, it's been getting worse too. and i've been having trouble swallowing without choking.
[doctor] okay. can you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
[patient] i was born prematurely and had aspiration pneumonia a few times as a child. i had surgery for an asd repair at age 14, ptosis repair at age 11, and i have scoliosis and a gait abnormality. i also have poor pharyngeal reflexes.
[doctor] thank you for that information. during the exam, we found that you have marked hypesthesia on your entire right side, with slowed ram on the left. you have short stature and a head tilt to the right. your left ptosis is decreased, with a decreased gag reflex bilaterally. you have full motor strength, but hyperreflexia throughout, with 3+ reflexes and babinski signs bilaterally. we also found that you have arnold chiari ii with syrinx, with severe basilar invagination, marked compression of the ventral pontomedullary junction, and downward descension of the cerebellar tonsils and vermis.
[patient] okay, what does that mean?
[doctor] it means that the back of your skull is too small, causing pressure on the brain and spinal cord. we need to do some further tests to see what we can do to help you. we'll start with an mri.
[patient] okay, sounds good.
[doctor] based on the mri, we have identified that you need a transpalatal/pharyngeal ventral decompression of pons/medulla with resection of clivus/odontoid and tracheostomy placement. we will also need to put a halo vest and ring on you. you will need to wear this for some time, but eventually, we will be able to remove it. you will also need a philadelphia collar for some time after that. after the procedure, you will likely have mildly spastic gait with good strength and hyperreflexia throughout. your gag response will be back to normal and you will be able to eat without difficulty. sensation will return to your extremities.
[patient] okay, sounds good. 
[doctor] great. do you have any questions or concerns?
[patient] no, i think i understand what needs to be done.

[patient] no, i think i understand them.
[doctor] okay, great. during your hospital stay, we treated you with antibiotics, steroids, and breathing treatments to help with your shortness of breath. we also optimized your bronchodilator therapy and continued your coumadin for your atrial fibrillation. unfortunately, on the third day of your admission, you developed worsening respiratory failure and had to be intubated and ventilated. however, you responded well to the aggressive bronchodilation and steroid therapy, and you were extubated on february 6th and put on bi-level positive airway pressure (bi-pap).

[doctor] based on the impression from the tests, it looks like you have decompensated vestibular hypofunction. we will book you for an electronystagmography and advise you to continue with your vestibular rehabilitation exercises. in addition, we will prescribe some supportive medical treatment in the form of betahistine 24mg twice a day. this should help with your symptoms.

"[doctor] hi there. i'm glad you came in for a dietary consultation. what can i help you with today?
[patient] hi, yes. i'm looking to lose weight because of my diabetes. i've been following a veggie diet i learned about in poland for the past three weeks and i want to know if i'm at risk of low blood sugar.
[doctor] understood. can you tell me a bit more about your current diet and how it's been affecting your blood sugar levels?
[patient] sure. the veggie diet doesn't allow any fruits, grains, starchy vegetables or meats, but i do eat nuts for protein. my blood sugar tends to be high in the morning if i eat too much the night before.
[doctor] i see. and have you been monitoring your blood sugar levels regularly?
[patient] no, i don't have any records with me right now.
[doctor] okay. well, i'd recommend including some solid protein with your bedtime snack to help address any fasting blood sugar elevations, and increasing the frequency of your physical activity to five days a week, for a duration of 30 minutes. it sounds like you're already doing some aerobic walking, which is great.
[patient] okay, thank you. and will losing weight help my diabetes?
[doctor] losing weight can definitely help improve your blood sugar control, but it's important to remember that diabetes is a chronic condition that requires ongoing management. i would encourage you to continue taking your medication as prescribed and monitoring your blood sugar levels regularly.
[patient] that makes sense. can you give me some dietary guidelines for weight reduction?
[doctor] of course. based on your current bmi, i would recommend a 1200-calorie meal plan to support a weight loss of at least one pound a week. it's important to keep track of your caloric intake and to try not to reduce it below 1000 calories daily. you may also want to consider taking a multivitamin supplement.

[patient] yes, i understand.

"[doctor]: hi there, how are you feeling after the transurethral electrosurgical resection of the prostate?
[patient]: i'm feeling okay, a bit sore.
[doctor]: that's normal, but we want to make sure there aren't any complications. have you noticed any bleeding or difficulty urinating?
[patient]: no, not really. it's a bit uncomfortable to urinate, but i think that's to be expected.
[doctor]: yes, that's normal. we want to make sure there aren't any complications such as infection or incontinence. but based on the surgery report, it looks like everything went well and there were no complications.
[patient]: that's good to hear.
[doctor]: now, you had the surgery because of severe benign prostatic hyperplasia. have you noticed any improvement in your urinary retention or bladder stones?
[patient]: yes, i have. i'm not having as much trouble urinating and i haven't noticed any bladder stones since the surgery.
[doctor]: that's great news. the surgery report shows that the resection of the prostate was successful, and we were able to remove the median and lateral lobes. we also discovered that your bladder was severely trabeculated with multiple bladder diverticula, but we were able to address that during the surgery as well.
[patient]: i see.
[doctor]: now, you may experience some impotence or formation of urethral strictures as potential complications of the surgery, but we will monitor you closely to make sure everything heals properly. in the meantime, make sure to follow the post-operative instructions and take any prescribed medications as directed. if you notice any unusual symptoms or have any concerns, don't hesitate to contact us.

"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the surgery?
[patient] i'm feeling okay, a little sore but i'm fine.
[doctor] good to hear that. the surgery went well, and we were able to remove the tumor completely. during the cystoscopy, we found a papillary tumor in the bladder neck, and we were able to remove it completely. we also found an abnormal dysplastic area in the left lateral wall, which we biopsied. the remainder of the bladder mucosa appeared normal. 
[patient] okay, that sounds good. 
[doctor] we performed a cystoscopy, transurethral resection of the medium bladder tumor (4.0 cm in diameter), and a direct bladder biopsy. the procedure was performed under general laryngeal mask anesthesia. 
[patient] alright. 
[doctor] after the anesthesia was administered, we placed you in the dorsal lithotomy position, and your perineum and genitalia were sterilized. we performed a cystourethroscopy using a #23-french acmi panendoscope and a 70-degree lens. we obtained a barbotage urine for cytology. 
[patient] okay. 
[doctor] we then introduced a #24-french continuous flow resectoscope sheath and took several biopsies from the tumor using cold cup biopsy forceps. we removed all the exophytic tumor and the lamina propria using the iglesias resectoscope element. we achieved complete hemostasis and removed all the chips with an ellik evacuator. 
[patient] i see. 
[doctor] we placed a #24-french foley catheter for efflux of clear irrigant at the conclusion of the procedure. you were then awakened, extubated, and taken to the recovery room.

[doctor] during the procedure, we found a well developed, but rather thin walled hernia sac on the right. we planned to perform a diagnostic laparoscopic look at the contralateral side to rule out an occult hernia, but due to the thinness of the hernia sac, it made it difficult to safely cannulate through the sac for the laparoscopy. therefore, high ligation was performed, and we aborted the plan for laparoscopic view of the left side. however, we were able to perform the hernia repair successfully.

[patient] no, they didn't have any questions. they agreed with the plan.
[doctor] great. during the procedure, we made an incision in the right lower abdomen and cleared the tissue layers through scarpa fascia and exposed the external oblique. we were able to identify and elevate the cord structure and carefully separated the hernia sac from the spermatic cord structures. dissection of the hernia sac back to the peritoneal reflection at the level of the deep inguinal ring was performed. we then performed a high ligation using transfixing and a simple mass ligature of 3-0 vicryl. the excess sac was trimmed and the spermatic cord structures were replaced. the external oblique fascia and scarpa layers were closed with interrupted 3-0 vicryl and skin was closed with subcuticular 5-0 monocryl and steri-strips. you tolerated the operation well and blood loss was minimal.

[doctor] great. during the procedure, we made an incision in the right lower abdomen and cleared the tissue layers through scarpa fascia and exposed the external oblique. we were able to identify and elevate the cord structure and carefully separated the hernia sac from the spermatic cord structures. dissection of the hernia sac back to the peritoneal reflection at the level of the deep inguinal ring was performed. we then performed a high ligation using transfixing and a simple mass ligature of 3-0 vicryl. the excess sac was trimmed, and the spermatic cord structures were replaced. the external oblique fascia and scarpa layers were closed with interrupted 3-0 vicryl, and skin was closed with subcuticular 5-0 monocryl and steri-strips. you tolerated the operation well, and blood loss was minimal.
[patient] thank you for explaining everything.
[doctor] of course. it's important that you understand what happened during the procedure. you'll be able to go home soon, but in the meantime, we'll monitor your pain and make sure you are comfortable. if you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to ask.",1
"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] hi, i'm feeling a little sore, but okay overall.
[doctor] great. so, the procedure went well. we did the hydrocelectomy and cystopyelogram as planned. we also did a bladder biopsy and fulguration for hemostasis. the good news is there were no papillary tumors or stones inside the bladder. how have you been feeling since your last visit?
[patient] i have been doing okay. i had some hematuria and the bladder tumor was discovered during the process.
[doctor] yes, i remember. we did a dissection of the tumor and you received bcg. how have you been feeling since then?
[patient] i have been doing well.
[doctor] great. we did the hydrocelectomy because you were having trouble sitting to void or put clothes on due to the size of the hydrocele. we discussed the risks of the procedure before going ahead with it. how are you feeling about the decision?
[patient] i understood the risks and wanted to go ahead with the procedure. i'm glad we did it.
[doctor] i'm glad to hear that. the procedure went smoothly. we made a transverse scrotal incision and removed the hydrocele fluid. we made sure to close the sac and pexed the testicle to ensure there was no risk of torsion. the bladder biopsy was done and fulgurated for hemostasis. you tolerated the procedure well and are healing nicely. we will follow up with you in a few months. in the meantime, take it easy and avoid heavy lifting, pushing, or pulling.

"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm feeling good, thanks for asking.
[doctor] great to hear that. i just wanted to discuss the results of your recent intravenous urogram. the test was negative which means there were no signs of obstruction or any other issues with your kidneys, ureters or bladder.
[patient] that's good to hear.
[doctor] yes, it's always great to have a normal test result. do you have any questions about the test or the results?

"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] i am feeling a bit groggy but overall okay.
[doctor] good to hear. so, the procedure was done to remove the recurrent bladder tumors you have been experiencing. during the procedure, a cystourethroscope was inserted into the bladder which revealed a 3-cm area of erythema and recurrent papillomatosis just above and lateral to the left ureteral orifice. using a cold punch biopsy forceps, a random biopsy was obtained and the entire area was electrofulgurated using the bugbee electrode. 
[patient] okay, is there anything more i need to know about the procedure?
[doctor] no, you tolerated the procedure well and there are no other lesions noted. we will send the biopsy for analysis to ensure the area is clear of any malignant cells. i will keep you updated on the results.

"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] i'm feeling okay, a little groggy from the anesthesia, but otherwise fine.
[doctor] good, i'm glad to hear that. i wanted to go over the findings from your surgery. it looks like you had some narrowing of the urethra, but we were able to dilate it to relieve that issue.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] additionally, we found some mild erythema on the posterior wall of your bladder, which we biopsied and cauterized with bovie cautery. we also found a midureteral polyp and some mild trabeculation of the bladder.
[patient] what does all that mean?
[doctor] the narrowing of your urethra was causing your urinary hesitancy and weak stream. the erythema on the posterior wall of your bladder could be a sign of inflammation, but we'll have to wait for the biopsy results to know more. the midureteral polyp is a growth that we'll need to monitor. and the trabeculation of the bladder is a sign of the bladder muscle working harder than it should, which can cause difficulty emptying your bladder.
[patient] i see.
[doctor] we took some samples to send to the lab, including a urine culture sensitivity and cytology and a bladder biopsy. we'll have the results of those tests in a couple of weeks. in the meantime, i'm going to give you a prescription for levaquin and pyridium to help with any discomfort you may have.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] it's important that you drink plenty of fluids and avoid any strenuous activity for a day or two. you should also avoid sexual activity until any discomfort has subsided. you'll need to follow up with me in two weeks to discuss the results of your tests and see how you're doing.
[patient] alright.

"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] i'm feeling okay, a bit sore.
[doctor] that's understandable. i just wanted to go over the results of the procedure with you. the cystoscopy and ureterorenoscopy showed that you have right hydronephrosis, which means there is a buildup of urine in your right kidney due to a blockage. however, we did not find any evidence of obstruction or lesions in your ureter or bladder. additionally, your urine cytology came back atypical/dysplastic which means there is some abnormality in the cells in your urinary tract.
[patient] oh, okay. so what's the next step?
[doctor] we collected a specimen from your right ureter through a catheter and sent it to pathology. we'll wait for those results to determine the best course of action. we did not find any stones or intrapelvic tumors, which is good news. we also confirmed that your left ureter and collecting system are normal.
[patient] that's good to hear. what caused the blockage in my right kidney?
[doctor] it's not entirely clear at this point. you have some ureteral thickening in your distal right ureter, which may be contributing to the blockage. we may need to do further testing to determine the cause.

[patient] i feel a bit sore, but overall, i'm doing okay. 
[doctor] that's understandable. i just wanted to go over the results with you. the procedure showed a papillary mass within the collecting system of your right kidney, and two biopsies were taken of the mass. we also found out that you have a right ureteropelvic junction obstruction, which means that the flow of urine from your right kidney to your bladder is blocked. to help with this, we placed a stent in your ureter. 
[patient] okay, i see. what does this mean for me in terms of treatment? 
[doctor] well, based on the biopsy results and the fact that you have a renal mass, it's likely that you will need to have your right kidney removed in a surgery called a nephrectomy. however, we will need to wait for the results of the echocardiogram tomorrow to make sure you are stable enough for surgery.

[patient] i feel a bit relieved, honestly. the urinary retention had been bothering me for a while.
[doctor] i'm glad to hear that. during the surgery, we found that your prostate was enlarged with prostatic varices of the median lobe. we performed a systematic transurethral resection of the prostate tissue to relieve your urinary retention. we used a #24 french three-way foley catheter to help with continuous bladder irrigation and to monitor your post-op condition. the estimated blood loss was 150 cc, which is normal for this procedure.

[patient] yes, i did.
[doctor] and, after the surgery, you were experiencing reduced vision in your operated eye?
[patient] yes, that's correct.
[doctor] that was because of the presence of a secondary capsular membrane. to correct that, we performed a yag laser capsulotomy on your right eye. do you remember the procedure?
[patient] yes, i do.
[doctor] you were seated at the yag laser, and we dilated your pupil with 1% mydriacyl, and instilled iopidine. then, the abraham capsulotomy lens was positioned, and we applied laser energy in a specific pattern. we did a total of...[looks at the medical note]...applications as per the outpatient note.

[patient] um, i'm feeling good. thank you.
[doctor] great! so, we're here to discuss the procedure you underwent recently. you had cataract surgery, right?
[patient] uh, yes, i did.
[doctor] and, after the surgery, you were experiencing reduced vision in your operated eye?
[patient] mm-hmm, yes, that's correct.
[doctor] that was because of the presence of a secondary capsular membrane. to correct that, we performed a yag laser capsulotomy on your right eye. do you remember the procedure?
[patient] oh, yes, i do.
[doctor] you were seated at the yag laser, and we dilated your pupil with 1% mydriacyl, and instilled iopidine. then, the abraham capsulotomy lens was positioned, and we applied laser energy in a specific pattern. we did a total of...[looks at the medical note]...applications as per the outpatient note.
[patient] okay, got it.
[doctor] now, how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] um, i feel much better. my vision has improved significantly.

[patient] hi doctor, i'm feeling okay, a little discomfort, but nothing too bad.
[doctor] that's good to hear. now, let's talk about the procedure. we performed the capsulotomy to remove the posterior capsule opacity in your right eye which was causing a gradual decrease in your vision. the procedure involved using the yag laser to make a circular cut in the posterior capsule through the visual axis. we used a total of ** shots and the total energy was **. the lens remained stable throughout the procedure and there were no complications.
[patient] okay, thank you for explaining it to me.
[doctor] of course. we used topical anesthesia with tetracaine ophthalmic drops to numb your eye before the procedure. afterward, we measured your post-laser intraocular pressure which was ** mmhg. we also provided you with postoperative instructions and alphagan p ophthalmic drops to use twice a day.
[patient] okay, i'll make sure to follow the instructions.

[patient] i'm a bit groggy, but okay.
[doctor] that's normal after surgery. i wanted to go over the details of the procedure with you. we performed a complex closure and debridement of a wound that was draining in your right upper quadrant. general surgery had lanced it before, but it continued to drain. we suspected a possible cerebrospinal fluid versus wound fistula, so we decided to excise the tract.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] we prepped and draped the area in the usual sterile fashion before removing the fistula and the fistulous tract. we confirmed that there was no csf drainage and visualized the catheter. the wound was irrigated and closed in multiple layers using different types of sutures. we also sent multiple cultures and the tracts to pathology. all sponge and needle counts were correct. do you have any questions?
[patient] no, not at the moment.

"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after your procedure?

[doctor] that's normal. so, the reason for your surgery was epiretinal membrane in your right eye and cme. can you tell me a little bit about how you were feeling before the procedure?
[patient] i was having trouble seeing out of my right eye. it was blurry and distorted.
[doctor] yes, that's a common symptom of epiretinal membrane. we discussed the options with you before the surgery, and we stressed that the outcome was guarded due to the chronic duration of the membrane. how are you feeling about the results so far?
[patient] it's still a little blurry, but i'm hoping it will improve.

"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] a little groggy, but okay, i think.
[doctor] that's normal. i just wanted to talk to you about what we did during the procedure. so, we performed a combined closed vitrectomy with membrane peeling, fluid-air exchange, and endolaser on your right eye. this was because you had a vitreous hemorrhage and a retinal detachment in that eye.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] we used a local anesthetic, and once you were properly numb, we began the procedure. we made three small openings in your eye, and using a microscope, we performed a vitrectomy, which is the removal of the vitreous humor, the gel-like substance in the eye. we then removed the membranes that were causing the retinal detachment and trimmed them to the ora serrata, the edge of the retina. after this, we completely mobilized the retina and performed a fluid-air exchange to settle the retina. we also used endolaser to apply several hundred applications around the margins of the retinal tears to seal them. after we inspected your eye and saw that the retina was completely attached, we closed the sclerotomy sites and the infusion line with sutures. we also closed the conjunctivae and tenon's with sutures, placed a collagen shield soaked in tobrex over the eye, and put a pressure bandage in place.
[patient] wow, that sounds like a lot.

[doctor] that's normal after anesthesia. i wanted to go over the results of your procedure. we performed an endoscopic third ventriculostomy to treat your aqueductal stenosis.
[patient] okay, what does that mean?
[doctor] it means we made a small incision on your scalp, and then used a tool to make a hole in the floor of your third ventricle to allow the cerebrospinal fluid to flow more freely. we confirmed that you did indeed have aqueductal stenosis, which is a narrowing of the passageway that allows the fluid to flow. we also noticed a markedly thinned down floor of the third ventricle.
[patient] is that bad?
[doctor] it's not necessarily bad, but it can be a sign of the aqueductal stenosis. we were able to successfully enlarge the opening using the tool and we inserted a bactiseal ventricular catheter to help the fluid flow properly. we also collected some csf for routine studies, but we don't anticipate any complications from the procedure.

[doctor] i see. well, the good news is that the procedure went smoothly and there were no complications. we removed the cerumen from the external auditory canals and placed a tube in each ear. the tympanic membranes appeared normal and we followed up with cortisporin otic drops and cotton balls to help with the healing process. 
[patient] that's a relief to hear.
[doctor] yes, it is. your child will need to avoid getting any water in the ears for now and we provided a prescription for ciloxan ear drops to be used as directed. we'll follow up in about a week to check on the healing progress.

"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] hi doctor, i'm feeling okay, a little soreness in my throat.
[doctor] that's normal, you had a tympanostomy and tube placement, and an adenoidectomy done. the procedure went well, you were under general anesthesia during the surgery.
[patient] yes, i was. can you explain to me what exactly was done?
[doctor] sure. after you were under anesthesia, we placed two catheters in your nasal passages which were brought out through the mouth and clamped over a dental gauze roll. this helped in providing soft palate retraction. then, we focused on your nasopharynx and used a bovie to fulgurate the adenoid bed. we began at the posterosuperior aspect of the nasopharynx and made linear passages through the base of the adenoid fossa until the entire nasopharynx and adenoid bed were fulgurated. after that, we examined your ears under an operating microscope, cleaned them out of any debris, and made an anteroinferior quadrant tympanostomy incision. we suctioned out any fluid from the middle ear space and placed a tympanostomy tube in each ear. cortisporin ear drops were instilled into both ears, and cotton balls were placed in the external meatus. 
[patient] okay, that sounds like a lot. will i be in a lot of pain after this?
[doctor] you may experience some soreness in your throat and ears, but we've prescribed some pain medication to help with that. it's important to take it easy and avoid any strenuous activities for a few days. you should also avoid getting water in your ears while showering or bathing. do you have any other questions or concerns?

"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after your surgery?
[patient] hi, i’m feeling a bit sore but okay overall.
[doctor] that’s expected. so, during the surgery, we confirmed that you had left cubital tunnel syndrome and ulnar nerve entrapment. we performed a decompression of the ulnar nerve in your left elbow. the ulnar nerve was significantly constricted as it passed through the cubital tunnel, and there was an hourglass constriction of the ulnar nerve.
[patient] okay, what does that mean?
[doctor] it means that the ulnar nerve was compressed and causing your symptoms. we were able to relieve that pressure by carefully dissecting and releasing the structures around the nerve. we also protected the muscular and cutaneous branches of the nerve, as well as the venous plexus, while performing the decompression.
[patient] i see.
[doctor] we used general anesthesia during the surgery, and once the procedure was complete, we closed the incision with staples and applied a well-padded dressing. you tolerated the procedure well, and there were no complications during or after the surgery.
[patient] okay, that sounds good. what should i expect during my recovery?
[doctor] you will need to keep your arm elevated and avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activity for a few weeks. you may also need to attend physical therapy to help regain strength and mobility in your arm. we will schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to check on your progress and make sure you are healing well.

[doctor] carcinoma is another word for cancer. specifically, it means that there are abnormal cells in your breast tissue that are growing and multiplying uncontrollably.

"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the trigger finger release procedure?
[patient] hi, doctor. i'm feeling okay, a little sore, but nothing too bad.
[doctor] good to hear. can you describe to me how the procedure went?
[patient] yes, after they gave me some antibiotics and put me under mac anesthesia, they prepped and draped my arm in the usual standard fashion. they also used esmarch to exsanguinate my arm and inflated the tourniquet to 250 mmhg. then, they made a longitudinal incision over my finger's a1 pulley.
[doctor] okay, and then what?
[patient] they dissected down to the flexor sheath, being careful to identify and protect the neurovascular bundles. they opened the sheath under direct vision with a scalpel, and then used scissors to release it from the proximal extent of the a1 pulley to just proximal to the proximal digital crease. they maintained meticulous hemostasis with bipolar electrocautery, and made sure that there was no triggering left by atraumatically pulling the tendons and having me actively move my digit.
[doctor] that sounds like everything went smoothly. what happened after they made sure there was no triggering left?
[patient] they irrigated the wound with sterile saline and closed it up with 5-0 nylon simple interrupted sutures. then, they dressed the wound and sent me to the recovery room. i tolerated the procedure well and was in good condition.
[doctor] great. it sounds like everything went well. do you have any questions or concerns?

[patient] hi, doctor. i'm feeling okay, a little sore but doing alright.
[doctor] that's understandable. i just wanted to go over some details of the procedure with you. so, we administered antibiotics and anesthesia, and then prepped and draped your arm in a sterile fashion.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] after that, we made a transverse incision over the mpj crease of your thumb and carefully identified and protected the neurovascular bundles as we opened up the flexor sheath. we released the a1 pulley and made sure to maintain meticulous hemostasis with bipolar electrocautery.

"[doctor] hi, how are you doing today?
[patient] hi, i'm doing fine, thank you.
[doctor] great. i'm here to discuss the recent procedures that were done for your 4-month-old daughter. as you know, we had to perform open-heart surgery to close her ventricular septal defect.
[patient] yes, i remember.
[doctor] during the surgery, we also inserted a transesophageal echocardiography probe to aid in the diagnostic process before and after surgery. the probe was passed into the esophagus without any resistance and was removed without any issues. however, after removing the cannula, i inserted a suction tube to empty the stomach, and there were a few milliliters of blood secretions that were suctioned. but there was no overt bleeding.
[patient] i see.
[doctor] we also attempted to insert arterial venous lines through both groins, but it was unsuccessful. i was unable to advance the seldinger wire after several successful punctures of the vessels. after the removal of needles, the area was compressed digitally for about five minutes. there was a small hematoma, but it was not growing. i used 1% lidocaine to infiltrate the vessels of the groin, and the circulation of the left leg became more than adequate. the o2 saturation monitor on the left toe functioned well throughout the procedures, from the beginning to the end. at the end of the procedure, the circulation of the leg was intact.

"[doctor]: hi, how are you feeling after the total knee replacement surgery? 

[patient]: hi, i'm feeling okay, just a bit sore. 

[doctor]: that's normal. can you tell me more about the procedure and how it went? 

[patient]: well, they put me to sleep and then placed a tourniquet on my upper thigh. after that, they made a midline incision over my patella and performed a median parapatellar arthrotomy. they removed the lateral patellar retinacular ligaments and retracted the patella laterally. then, they denuded the proximal medial tibia and released the acl and pcl. they also removed the medial and lateral menisci and suprapatellar fat pad to allow for anterior subluxation of the tibia. 

[doctor]: i see. and then what happened? 

[patient]: they pinned an extramedullary tibial cutting jig to the proximal tibia, and made a flush cut along the tibial plateau. after that, they drilled an intramedullary hole into the femur and inserted a femoral rod attached to the anterior cutting block. the block was pinned in the appropriate position, and they made an anterior rough cut. the distal cutting jig was then placed atop this cut surface and pinned to the distal femur. 

[doctor]: and how did they ensure everything was aligned correctly? 

[patient]: they used a variety of techniques to judge correct rotation, then sized the femoral component with a sizer and pinned the appropriate size femoral 4-in-1 chamfer-cutting block in place. they made the cuts, then pinned the notch-cutting block to the cut surface slightly laterally and made the notch cut. they then impacted the trial femoral component onto the distal femur and found it to have an excellent fit. 

[doctor]: that's great. and what about the tibial component? 

[patient]: they inserted a trial tibial plate and polyethylene, and judged stability to be adequate in all planes. they identified the appropriate rotation of the tibial component and marked it, then pinned the plate to the plateau. they made the keel, and after placing the femoral component, checked range of motion and stability in various ranges of flexion and extension. 

[doctor]: sounds like they were very thorough. and then what happened with the patella? 

[patient]: the patella was held in a slightly everted position with the knee in extension. they checked the width with calipers, then performed a free-hand cut of the patellar articular surface and checked to ensure symmetry with the calipers. they drilled 3 lug holes with the jig in place, taking care to medialize and superiorize the component as much as possible given bony anatomy. they recessed any excess lateral patellar bone, and the trial patellar component was placed and found to have adequate tracking. 

[doctor]: and then they applied cement to the components and cut surfaces, and impacted the components. they removed any excess cement, and the knee was brought into full extension with the trial polyethylene and further axially pressurized as cement hardened. after that, the tourniquet was deflated, and the knee was dislocated again. they removed any excess cement with an osteotome, then thoroughly irrigated and obtained adequate hemostasis. they closed the arthrotomy and subcutaneous tissues with sutures, and sealed the skin with staples.

[doctor] great. so, we started with administering general endotracheal anesthesia and prepping your neck, chest, and legs for the procedure. we then made a midline median sternotomy incision using a #10-blade scalpel and opened the sternum with a sternal saw. after positioning the chest retractor, we gave you full-dose heparin and opened the pericardium. we then placed an aortic cannula and venous cannula to connect you to the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.
[patient] okay, i think i remember that part.
[doctor] good. we then used cold blood cardioplegia to arrest your heart, and we excised the diseased aortic valve leaflets. after removing all the calcium from the aortic annulus, we placed a **-mm toronto stentless porcine valve in its place. we then gave another round of cold blood antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia.
[patient] i see.
[doctor] after that, we closed your aorta in a running fashion, de-aired your heart, and removed the aortic cross-clamp. we placed atrial and ventricular pacing wires, and after weaning you from cardiopulmonary bypass, we gave you full-dose protamine. we then closed the sternum with #7 wires and closed the incision with sutures.
[patient] wow, that's a lot of steps.
[doctor] yes, it is a complex procedure. but i'm glad to hear that you're doing okay. do you have any questions or concerns?
[patient] no, i think i understand everything. thank you for explaining it to me.
[doctor] of course. we'll continue to monitor you closely during your recovery.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after your surgery?

"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after the tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy?
[patient] i'm feeling a little sore, but okay.
[doctor] that's good to hear. we performed the surgery because you have had about four to five episodes of adenotonsillitis per year for the last three to four years. how has your experience been with that?
[patient] it's been really tough. i've missed school and activities because of the illness.
[doctor] i can imagine. well, the surgery went well. we obtained specimens of your right and left tonsils 2+ and adenoid pad 1+. we used general endotracheal tube anesthesia for the procedure. the estimated blood loss was less than 5 cc, and there were no complications during the surgery.
[patient] that's good to know.
[doctor] during the procedure, we used the mcivor mouth gag to carefully position the retractor and visualize the oropharynx. we used a bovie cautery to make an incision in the mucosa of the right and left anterior tonsillar pillar to dissect the tonsils out. we then used suction cautery to cauterize the adenoid pad. we applied tonsillar sponge to the tonsillar fossae and achieved adequate hemostasis.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] you tolerated the procedure well and have been transported to the recovery room in stable condition. do you have any questions or concerns?

[doctor] that's expected. your surgery was successful. we found that you had 4+/4+ cryptic and hypertrophic tonsils with 2+/3+ hypertrophic adenoid pads. these were causing difficulty swallowing, recurrent pharyngitis, and sleep-induced respiratory disturbance. so, we removed them with the electrocautery enucleation technique.
[patient] oh, i see. that sounds serious.
[doctor] it was a necessary procedure to relieve your symptoms. we irrigated your oropharynx and nasopharynx with normal saline and a small amount of iodine, and hemostased the tonsillar fossa with suction cautery. we injected 0.5% ropivacaine with 1:100,000 adrenal solution to the area before closing it with 2-0 monocryl on an sh needle. we also removed the redundant soft tissue of the uvula and cauterized it with electrocautery to prevent swelling of the uvula in the postoperative period.
[patient] okay, i understand.
[doctor] you may experience some discomfort, soreness, and difficulty swallowing for a few days. we have prescribed some pain medication to help with the discomfort. it is important to avoid hard and crunchy foods, and to get plenty of rest and fluids during your recovery period.

[doctor] i'm glad to hear that. i wanted to discuss your recent surgery with you. you had a total thyroidectomy, is that correct?
[patient] yes, that's right.
[doctor] the reason for the surgery was due to your thyroid goiter, which was caused by your history of graves' disease. we attempted suppression, but it was unsuccessful.
[patient] yes, that's correct.
[doctor] during the surgery, we used general endotracheal anesthesia and 9cc of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine. the surgery went well, and there were no complications.
[patient] that's good to hear.
[doctor] during the surgery, we made an incision in the pre-demarcated and anesthetized area, and used unipolar electrocautery for hemostasis. we also identified and separated the sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscles, as well as the middle thyroid vein. we were very careful to not damage the recurrent laryngeal nerve.
[patient] that sounds very meticulous.
[doctor] yes, we wanted to ensure the best outcome possible. after the surgery, we evaluated the visceral space and found no bleeding. we irrigated the area and applied surgicel as needed. we then approximated the appropriate fascial attachments and placed steri-strips, tincoban, bacitracin, and a pressure gauze.

[doctor]: that's normal after a surgery like this. i just wanted to go over your preoperative diagnosis of degenerative disk disease and disk protrusions with radiculopathy at l4-l5 and l5-s1. the procedure we performed was a transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (tlif) on your left side, as well as a posterior fusion on your right side. we used the danek m8 system for fixation and placed intervertebral prosthetic devices (danek capstone spacers) at l4-l5 and l5-s1. we also used vertebral autograft plus bone morphogenetic protein (bmp) to help with fusion.
[patient]: okay, thank you.
[doctor]: we did not encounter any complications during the surgery and your estimated blood loss was 300 ml. your anesthesia was a general endotracheal and we did not find any surprises during the operation.
[patient]: that's good to hear.
[doctor]: after the surgery, we irrigated the wound and placed surgicel over the exposed dura and disk space. we also placed bmp sponges with supplemental vertebral autograft in the posterolateral fusion bed and vertebral autograft in the dorsal aspect of the l4-l5 and l5-s1 facets on the right. we then closed the wound with sutures and staples.

[patient] hi, doctor. i'm feeling a little sore but okay overall.
[doctor] that's to be expected. i just wanted to go over the details of your surgery with you. so we performed a total thyroidectomy for your multinodular thyroid goiter with compressive symptoms and bilateral dominant thyroid nodules that were proven to be benign by fine needle aspiration. you understood the risks and benefits of the procedure, including anesthesia, bleeding, infection, injury to nerves, vocal fold paralysis, hoarseness, low calcium, need for calcium supplementation, tumor recurrence, need for additional treatment, need for thyroid medication, cosmetic deformity, and others, is that correct?
[patient] yes, i understood all of that and still wanted to proceed with the surgery.
[doctor] great. during the surgery, we made a 7 cm incision in the lower skin crease of your neck and raised subplatysmal flaps to the thyroid notch and sternal respectively. we separated your strap muscles in the midline and used a harmonic scalpel to ligate the veins in the pretracheal region. we then dissected the capsule off your left thyroid lobe, which was very firm in nature, and ligated the superior thyroid pole in the superior third artery, vein, and the individual vessels. we protected your superior and inferior parathyroid glands and identified your recurrent laryngeal nerve in the tracheoesophageal groove.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] on the right side, there was a significant amount of thyroid tissue with multiple nodules that were also very firm. we dissected the capsule off the thyroid gland and protected your superior and inferior parathyroid glands. we ligated your superior thyroid artery and vein with the harmonic scalpel and your inferior thyroid artery close to the thyroid gland capsule. we identified your recurrent laryngeal nerve and confirmed that it was working properly. once we had complete visualization of the entire nerve, we transected berry's ligament and then dissected the thyroid gland over the trachea. we removed the entire thyroid specimen and marked it with a stitch upon the superior pole. we irrigated the wound, controlled the bleeding points, and buried the surgicel on the wound bed on both sides. we reapproximated your strap muscles in the midline and placed a hemovac drain. we closed your incision with interrupted sutures and injected some 40 mg per cubic centimeter kenalog into the incisional line to help with any potential keloid formation.
[patient] i see. and everything went well?
[doctor] yes, you tolerated the procedure well, and post-surgery, we did a fiberoptic laryngoscopy that revealed intact bilateral true vocal fold mobility. we will monitor your calcium levels and thyroid hormone levels and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss any further treatment if needed.

[doctor] that's normal after a procedure like this. let me go over the details of what we did. we performed a thrombectomy on your arteriovenous shunt in your left forearm, which means we removed the blood clot that was causing the blockage. during the procedure, we also found a narrowing in the venous anastomosis, which is the connection between the vein and the graft. we performed a patch angioplasty to fix this issue, which involves placing a patch of ptfe material over the graftotomy to improve blood flow. we used a local anesthesia to numb the area, so you were awake during the procedure.
[patient] okay, i understand.
[doctor] good. we also administered heparin intravenously, which is a blood thinner, to prevent further clotting. we used a #4 fogarty catheter to systematically remove the thrombus, and dilated the narrowing with a #5 coronary dilator. we then closed the incision with sutures and applied a sterile dressing. you did well during the procedure, and we made sure to count all instruments and sponges to ensure nothing was left inside.
[patient] thank you for explaining everything to me.
[doctor] no problem. we will monitor you closely to make sure the shunt is working properly and there are no complications. you should avoid any strenuous activity with your left arm for a few days and keep the area clean and dry. if you experience any redness, swelling, or discharge from the wound, please let us know immediately. do you have any questions?
[patient] no, i think i understand everything. thank you, doctor.
[doctor] you're welcome. we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to make sure you're healing properly. take care.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after your procedure?

"[doctor]: hi, how are you feeling?
[patient]: i’m doing okay, a little groggy still from the anesthesia.
[doctor]: that’s normal. you just had an operation to repair an esophageal rupture. can you tell me how you’re feeling now?
[patient]: i’m feeling a little sore in my chest, but overall i think i’m doing okay.
[doctor]: that’s good to hear. during the operation, we performed a left thoracotomy and removed some pleural fluid before repairing the perforation in your esophagus. we also did a diagnostic laparoscopy and performed a gastrostomy. the gastrostomy tube was then confirmed to be in the correct position using a radiographic gastrostomy tube study. does that all sound familiar to you?
[patient]: yes, i remember the doctor explaining all of that to me before the surgery.
[doctor]: great. we also found some friability in the tissue of your esophagus, so we used a small intercostal flap to provide coverage and repair. we placed two chest tubes to help with drainage and closed your chest wall with sutures. we also performed a laparoscopic gastrostomy, which involved passing a tube through the skin and into your stomach to help with feeding. does that all make sense to you?
[patient]: yes, it does.
[doctor]: perfect. we’ll continue to monitor your progress and ensure that your gastrostomy is working properly. you may need to stay in the hospital for a few more days to recover from the surgery, but we’ll keep you updated on your progress.","[doctor]: hi, how are you feeling?

[patient] i'm feeling okay, a little sore.
[doctor] that's understandable. how's your breathing?
[patient] it's a little difficult, but i'm able to manage.
[doctor] good to hear. i wanted to go over the results of the surgery. the procedure went smoothly and we were able to remove the pleural-based nodule from your left lung.
[patient] that's great to hear.
[doctor] the findings from the surgery showed that the nodule was on a thin pleural pedicle and had not invaded the chest wall. we were able to remove it without the need for chest wall reconstruction.
[patient] that's a relief.
[doctor] yes, it's always good news when we can avoid more invasive procedures. we did place a 24-french chest tube in your left thorax and a foley catheter during the surgery. we also collected a specimen of the nodule for further testing.
[patient] okay.

"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling?
[patient] i feel okay.
[doctor] i'm glad to hear that. you had a thrombectomy procedure done earlier today to remove a clot in your left forearm loop graft. do you understand what the procedure was for?
[patient] yes, i do. my graft was blocked, and i was not able to have my dialysis as usual.
[doctor] that's correct. your potassium level was also high, which made it risky to do the procedure right away. so, you had to have a temporary hemodialysis catheter placed in your femoral vein for dialysis. how did it all go?
[patient] it went well. i was able to have dialysis last night and this morning before my procedure.
[doctor] great to hear that. during the procedure, a transverse incision was made at the venous anastomosis of the graft, and a thrombectomy was done using a catheter and a #4 fogarty balloon. the balloon was then passed beyond the clot to inspect the plug, and the area was checked for any stenosis. the procedure went smoothly, and a #6-0 prolene suture was used to close the graft. did you experience any complications during the procedure?

[patient] it's a little easier than before the procedure, but still a little labored.
[doctor] okay, well that's to be expected. we removed about 2000 ml of fluid from your left pleural cavity, which should help alleviate some of your symptoms. however, you may still feel some discomfort and shortness of breath for a little while longer.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] we did notice that towards the end of the procedure, you mentioned feeling faint. can you tell me a little bit more about that?

"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after your procedure?
[patient] i'm feeling okay, a little sore.
[doctor] that's normal. let's go over what we did. we performed a left carpal tunnel release along with a flexor tenosynovectomy. we also administered a cortisone injection for your trigger fingers in the third and fourth fingers, and an injection for your dupuytren's nodule in the palm. we used local anesthesia with iv sedation for the procedure.
[patient] yes, i remember that much.
[doctor] good. we injected a mixture of 1% xylocaine and 0.5% marcaine in the distal forearm and proximal palm for the carpal tunnel surgery. we made a short incision around the base of your thenar eminence and carefully incised the transverse carpal ligament. we made sure to divide the entire length of the retinaculum and release the antebrachial fascia for a distance of 2-3 cm proximal to the wrist crease to ensure complete decompression of the median nerve.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] we then debulked the contents of the carpal canal by dissecting the tenosynovium from the flexor tendons, followed by an epineurotomy and partial epineurectomy to relieve local external scarring of the epineurium. we then laid the retinacular flap loosely in place over the contents of the carpal canal, closed the skin with sutures, and applied a well-padded, well-molded volar plaster splint and lightly compressive ace wrap.
[patient] and then you administered the injections.
[doctor] yes, we used a syringe with kenalog-10 and xylocaine to inject the third finger a1 and a2 pulley tendon sheaths as well as the fourth finger a1/a2 pulley tendon sheath using standard injection technique. we also injected the dupuytren's nodule in the midpalm to relieve local discomfort.
[patient] okay, that makes sense.
[doctor] after the procedure, we discharged you to the ambulatory recovery area and from there discharged you home. we prescribed darvocet-n 100 for pain management and asked you to begin gentle active flexion, extension, and passive nerve glide exercises beginning 24-48 hours after surgery. we also asked you to keep the dressings clean, dry, and intact, and to follow up in my office.

[doctor] good. we injected a mixture of 1% xylocaine and 0.5% marcaine in the distal forearm and proximal palm for the carpal tunnel surgery. we made a short incision around the base of your thenar eminence and carefully incised the transverse carpal ligament. we made sure to divide the entire length of the retinaculum and release the antebrachial fascia for a distance of 2-3 cm proximal to the wrist crease to ensure complete decompression of the median nerve.
[patient] uh-huh.
[doctor] we then debulked the contents of the carpal canal by dissecting the tenosynovium from the flexor tendons, followed by an epineurotomy and partial epineurectomy to relieve local external scarring of the epineurium. we then laid the retinacular flap loosely in place over the contents of the carpal canal, closed the skin with sutures, and applied a well-padded, well-molded volar plaster splint and lightly compressive ace wrap.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] we then administered the injections using a syringe with kenalog-10 and xylocaine to inject the third finger a1 and a2 pulley tendon sheaths as well as the fourth finger a1/a2 pulley tendon sheath using standard injection technique. we also injected the dupuytren's nodule in the midpalm to relieve local discomfort.
[patient] got it.
[doctor] after the procedure, we discharged you to the ambulatory recovery area and from there discharged you home. we prescribed darvocet-n 100 for pain management and asked you to begin gentle active flexion, extension, and passive nerve glide exercises beginning 24-48 hours after surgery. we also asked you to keep the dressings clean, dry, and intact, and to follow up in my office.
[patient] alright, that makes sense. thanks for explaining everything.
[doctor] no problem, if you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out.",1
"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling?
[patient] hi, i'm feeling a bit groggy but okay.
[doctor] you just had a procedure done to extract multiple abscessed teeth and drain an abscess. how are you feeling in terms of pain and discomfort?
[patient] it's a bit sore and swollen, but the pain is manageable with the medication you prescribed.
[doctor] that's good to hear. we also placed a quarter-inch penrose drain in the left mandibular vestibule adjacent to teeth #18 and #19. have you been experiencing any issues with it?
[patient] no, it's been secure with the 3-0 silk suture and i haven't had any excessive bleeding or discharge from the area.
[doctor] that's good. we aspirated some purulent material and sent it to the lab for culture. we will follow up with you once the results come in. in the meantime, it's important to take your antibiotics as prescribed and to follow the aftercare instructions we gave you to avoid any further complications.

[patient] yes, that's correct.
[doctor] we also removed a few teeth and performed a modified le fort i osteotomy to weaken your maxilla in order to allow for expansion. the procedure went smoothly and there were no complications. you lost about 100 ml of blood during the surgery, which is normal.
[patient] okay, that's good to hear.

"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] a little sore, but okay, i guess.
[doctor] i understand. the procedure went well, and i wanted to give you some information about what we found. the products of conception were consistent with a six-week intrauterine pregnancy, which is what we expected based on the ultrasound. unfortunately, we did not detect any heart tones.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] the procedure involved suction, dilation, and curettage, which means we removed the products of conception from your uterus using a suction device and a sharp curette. this was done under spinal anesthesia. the procedure went smoothly, and there were no complications.
[patient] that's good to hear.
[doctor] you lost about 50 milliliters of blood during the procedure, which is a normal amount. we checked for hemostasis and everything looked good. we will conduct some follow-up tests and exams to make sure that you are healing properly after the surgery.

[doctor] that's correct. you also had a neuromonitoring performed to ensure that the nerves were not damaged during the surgery. you are currently in the intensive care unit and will be managed there and on the floor as indicated. all instrument, sponge, and needle counts were correct at the end of the case. is there anything else you would like to know?
[patient] no, i think that covers everything. thank you, doctor.
[doctor] no problem. we will continue to monitor your recovery closely.",1
"[doctor]: hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient]: hi doctor, i'm feeling fine, thank you.
[doctor]: good to hear. i see here that you had a skin biopsy performed on your left calf and thigh. can you tell me a little about that procedure?
[patient]: yes, the site was cleaned and a local anesthetic was given. then a 3 mm punch biopsy was performed in each location above my left knee. the site was checked for bleeding and a local antibiotic was placed, then bandaged.
[doctor]: okay, and it looks like there were no complications during the procedure. that's good to hear. i see you were instructed to keep the site completely dry for the next 24 hours, and to avoid getting the site dirty or infected. have you been able to follow those instructions?
[patient]: yes, i have. i've been careful to keep the site clean and dry.
[doctor]: great. and just to confirm, you're not on any anticoagulant medications and there were no other medications that would affect the biopsy?
[patient]: no, that's correct.
[doctor]: perfect. the biopsy sample will be sent for analysis and you will follow up with me within the next two weeks to review the results. if you have any concerns or questions before then, don't hesitate to reach out to me.","[doctor]: hiya, how's it going today?
[patient]: oh, hey doc, i'm feeling pretty good. thanks for asking.
[doctor]: awesome. so, it looks like you had a skin biopsy done on your left calf and thigh. can you tell me a little about that?
[patient]: yeah, so they cleaned the site and gave me some local anesthesia. then they did a 3 mm punch biopsy in both locations above my left knee. after that, they checked for any bleeding and put a local antibiotic on it, then covered it up.
[doctor]: got it. and it seems like everything went smoothly, right? no complications?
[patient]: nope, it went great. i've been keeping the site completely dry for the last 24 hours and trying to keep it clean.
[doctor]: perfect. and just to double-check, you're not on any blood thinners or any other medication that would impact the biopsy?
[patient]: no, that's correct.
[doctor]: fantastic. we'll send the biopsy sample for analysis and you'll come back to see me in two weeks to go over the results. if you have any questions or concerns before then, don't hesitate to let me know, okay? mm-hmm.",1
"[doctor] hello, how are you feeling?
[patient] i feel a bit groggy, but okay.
[doctor] that's normal. you just had surgery. i'm dr. smith, and i was in the operating room with you. i wanted to go over your procedure with you and make sure you understand what we did. do you remember why you needed surgery?
[patient] yes, i had a fracture on the right side of my face.
[doctor] that's correct. you had a depressed anterior table frontal sinus fracture on the right side, a right nasoorbital ethmoid fracture, a right orbital blowout fracture with entrapped periorbita, and a nasal septal and nasal pyramid fracture with nasal airway obstruction. during the surgery, we fixed these injuries. we used general endotracheal anesthesia, and you were placed in a supine position.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] we made a gull-wing incision on your forehead scalp and removed the hair along the suture line to expose the depression of the anterior table of the frontal sinus. we then made an inferior flap on your forehead, and we exposed the medial orbital wall on the right side. we were able to reposition the displaced fractures of the right medial orbital wall through a coronal approach. we also reduced the ethmoid fracture by aligning it more appropriately in the medial wall. we were able to satisfactorily reduce the anterior table fracture, and we used multiple screws and plate fixation to recontour the anterior forehead. we also removed a mucocele from the frontal sinus, but there was no significant destruction of the posterior wall, and we used a sinus seeker to pass it into the nasofrontal duct without difficulty. we did not need to obliterate the frontal sinus. we then folded the pericranial flap in a fan-folded fashion on top of the plate and screw hardware and fixed it in position with sutures to maintain a better contour of your forehead. 
[patient] okay, that makes sense so far.
[doctor] we also corrected your nasal septal and nasal pyramid fractures by performing osteotomies on both sides of your nose. this allowed us to mobilize the nasal pyramid satisfactorily, but there is still a high septal deviation that would not allow complete correction of the deviation. we may need to perform open reduction rhinoplasty with spread of cartilage grafting in order to straighten the septum high dorsally at a later date.
[patient] okay, i understand.
[doctor] lastly, we performed a transconjunctival exploration of your right orbital floor by making an incision in the palpebral conjunctiva and capsular palpebral fascia beneath the tarsal plate preseptal approach to the inferior orbital rim. we then performed subperiosteal dissection over the orbital floor and achieved hemostasis with electrocautery. we released the entrapped periorbita and repositioned the fractures, but did not fix them in position. we performed forced ductions to ensure we released the periorbit satisfactorily. we then closed the conjunctival incision with an interrupted simple 6-0 plain gut suture.
[patient] i see.
[doctor] we closed your coronal incision with interrupted 3-0 pds suture for the galea and deep subcutaneous tissue and the skin closed with interrupted surgical staples. we dressed your nose with steri-strips and used a mastisol orthoplast splint after the doyle splints were placed in your nose and secured with 3-0 prolene suture. we packed your nose with two kennedy merocel sponges and applied a supportive mildly compressive dressing with fluffs, kerlix, and 4-inch ace.
[patient] okay, thank you for explaining everything to me.

"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after the surgery?
[patient] hi doctor, honestly a bit groggy still but overall feeling okay.
[doctor] okay, glad to hear that. i just wanted to go over the details of the procedure we performed. we addressed the nasal septal deviation and bilateral internal and external nasal valve collapse that were causing your upper airway resistance and nasal obstruction. we performed a revision septoplasty and used auricular cartilage to repair the internal and external nasal valve collapse. we also harvested right auricular cartilage for the grafting procedures. 
[patient] okay, thank you. 
[doctor] during the procedure, we found a significant deviation of the nasal septum and a large septal spur along the floor. we carefully removed the spur using an osteotome and preserved the 1.5 cm dorsal and caudal strap of the nasal septum. we also harvested the right-sided auricular cartilage, which was done after the region had been prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. we fashioned the cartilage into bilateral spreader grafts and alar rim grafts, which were sutured in place using submucoperichondrial pockets. we also performed an external septorhinoplasty approach to reveal straight septum and secured it in place using a 5-0 pds suture in a mattress fashion in two places. following this, the area was closed and we placed doyle splints to ensure proper healing. 
[patient] okay, that makes sense. 
[doctor] you may experience some discomfort and swelling in the nasal area, but this is normal after this type of procedure. we will schedule a follow-up appointment to ensure proper healing and address any concerns you may have. in the meantime, avoid blowing your nose and strenuous activity.

[patient] um, hi doctor, honestly a bit groggy still but overall feeling okay.
[doctor] okay, glad to hear that. uh, i just wanted to go over the details of the procedure we performed. we addressed the nasal septal deviation and bilateral internal and external nasal valve collapse that were causing your upper airway resistance and nasal obstruction. we performed a revision septoplasty and used auricular cartilage to repair the internal and external nasal valve collapse. we also harvested right auricular cartilage for the grafting procedures.

[doctor] that's normal. i just wanted to go over what we did during the procedure. we shaved the right side of your head and prepped the area with betadine. then we gave you an injection of xylocaine with epinephrine to numb the area. after that, we made a small incision parallel to the midline, next to the coronal suture, using a twist drill. we then inserted a scott cannula into your right lateral ventricle, which allowed us to drain the bloody and clear csf. finally, we secured the cannula to your skin using 3-0 silk sutures and connected it to an external drainage set at 10 cm of water.

[doctor] i wanted to talk to you about the procedure we performed on you. we found a stage iv necrotic sacral decubitus which we had to debride.
[patient] alright, what does that mean?
[doctor] we had to remove the necrotic or dead tissue in the sacral region, which measured around 15cm x 15cm. we used local sedation and injected a 0.25% marcaine to numb the area before we began. we removed all of the necrotic tissue down to the presacral fascia and used electrocautery to stop any bleeding. afterward, we placed a bandage over the area and sent you to recovery.

"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the surgery?
[patient] hi, i'm feeling good, just a little sore.
[doctor] that's normal after a surgery like this. let me go over your postoperative diagnoses. you had right pelvic pain and an ovarian mass. during the surgery, we found an 8 cm x 10 cm right ovarian cyst with ovarian torsion, which we removed through laparoscopic right salpingooophorectomy. how are you feeling now?
[patient] i'm a little relieved that the cyst is out, but still sore.
[doctor] that's understandable. the surgery went well with no complications. your estimated blood loss was less than 50 cc, and you did not need any tubes or drains. we sent your right tube and ovary to pathology for review, and i'll let you know if there are any findings. 
[patient] okay, thank you.
[doctor] the surgery was indicated because you presented to the emergency room with right lower quadrant pain that was increasing in intensity despite multiple pain medications given in the emergency room. you also reported positive nausea and vomiting, with an ultrasound that demonstrated an 8 cm right ovarian cyst that was questionable hemorrhagic. we made the decision to take you for a diagnostic laparoscopy with a possible oophorectomy due to these findings.
[patient] okay, thank you for explaining that.
[doctor] of course. during the surgery, we made a 1 cm incision in the infraumbilical fold, placed a veress step needle into the abdomen, and then inserted a #11 mm step trocar and sleeve into the infraumbilical port without any difficulty. we found the ovarian cyst and removed it through a #12 mm port placed in the right flank region. we aspirated approximately 200 cc of clear yellow fluid from the cyst while it was still inside the endocatch bag. after the ovary was removed, we irrigated the abdomen with warm normal saline and closed the incision sites. 
[patient] thank you for explaining that to me.
[doctor] absolutely. you're going to feel sore for a few days, so i recommend taking it easy and avoiding any strenuous activities. you should also follow up with your primary care physician and come back to see me for a postoperative evaluation in a few weeks. do you have any questions or concerns?

[doctor] we will send the tissue samples for routine permanent examination, and you will need to come back for follow-up appointments to monitor your recovery and any further treatment that may be required. is there anything else you want to ask me right now?
[patient] uh, no, not at the moment.
[doctor] alright, let's get you some pain medication and some rest. i'll see you at your next appointment.",1
"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after the surgery?
[patient] hi doctor, i feel fine, a little groggy from the anesthesia, but otherwise okay.
[doctor] that's normal, let me check your incision site. looks good, the dressing is intact and there's no bleeding or swelling. how's your pain?
[patient] it's not too bad, a little sore but nothing too severe.
[doctor] great, we'll give you some pain medication to help with that. so, the procedure went well and we were able to remove the venous port without any complications. you had the port placed in orange county when you were diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia, is that right?
[patient] yes, that's correct.
[doctor] and you've been receiving chemotherapy here and now you're in remission, which is great news. you no longer need the venous port, so that's why we removed it today. the procedure involved removing the old scar and opening the port pocket to remove the catheter. there was some resistance to the catheter being removed, so we followed the path of the catheter until it could be pulled out easily. we closed the port pocket using sutures and applied sterile dressing to the site. do you have any questions about the procedure?
[patient] no, not really. when can i go home?
[doctor] we'll keep you here for a little while longer to make sure you're fully recovered from the anesthesia and there are no complications. once we're confident that you're stable, you'll be able to go home.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after the surgery?

"[doctor]: good afternoon. how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient]: hello, i'm feeling better. the pain is not as intense as before.
[doctor]: great to hear that. can you tell me about your symptoms before the procedure?
[patient]: sure. i was diagnosed with complex regional pain syndrome type i, and i had pain, allodynia, mottled appearance, skin changes, and swelling on my left upper extremity.
[doctor]: i see. and how was the procedure? did you experience any complications?
[patient]: no, i didn't. i had iv sedation with versed and fentanyl during the procedure, and there was no blood loss or complications.
[doctor]: that's good to hear. can you tell me about the procedure itself?
[patient]: yes, i was admitted to the operating room, and they placed monitors, including ekg, pulse oximeter, and bp cuff. they placed a pillow under my shoulder blades and allowed my head and neck to fall back into hyperextension. the neck region was prepped and draped in sterile fashion with betadine and alcohol. they introduced a 22 gauge smk 5-mm bare tipped needle between the cricothyroid membrane and the carotid sheath and directed it inferiomedially. the tip of the needle intersected with the vertebral body of cervical #7, and after negative aspiration, 5 cc of solution consisting of 5 cc of 0.5% marcaine and 1 cc of triamcinolone was injected into the stellate ganglion region. neurolysis was then carried out for 60 seconds at 80 degrees centigrade. they repeated the exact same procedure one more time to complete the two lesions of the stellate ganglion.
[doctor]: thank you for the detailed explanation. did you experience any side effects after the procedure?
[patient]: no, i didn't. the pressure was placed over the puncture site for approximately five minutes to eliminate any hemorrhage from blood vessels that may have been punctured, and a band-aid was placed over the puncture site. i was monitored for an additional ten to fifteen minutes, and there were no adverse sequelae.
[doctor]: that's excellent. do you have any questions or concerns?

"[doctor] hello, how are you feeling?
[patient] i am feeling good, thank you.
[doctor] that's great to hear. so, i went through your medical history and i see that you have been having some long-standing nasal obstruction along with concerns about the external appearance of your nose, is that correct?
[patient] yes, that's right.
[doctor] alright. based on the details that you provided to me, i believe that you would benefit from cosmetic rhinoplasty. we will start by straightening your nasal septum and reducing the size of your turbinates. after that, we will work on reducing the hump on your nose, rotating the tip, and de-projecting it. i have explained the risks, benefits, alternatives, and complications of the post-surgical procedure to you. do you have any questions or concerns?
[patient] no, i don't have any questions. i'm ready for the surgery.
[doctor] okay. we will give you general anesthesia via endotracheal tube before the procedure. during the procedure, we will make a left hemitransfixion incision and bring it down into the left intercartilaginous incision. we will also make a right intercartilaginous incision and then correct the severe left-sided nasal septal deviation. we will remove the posterior vomerine spur and cut and resect the anterior and inferior one-third of each inferior turbinate. we will then lower the cartilaginous septum and reduce the bony hump of the nose. after that, we will narrow the bony width of the nose by carrying out fading medial osteotomies and creating lateral osteotomies. finally, we will address the tip of the nose and enhance its rotation. after the surgery, we will place doyle nasal splints on either side of the nasal septum and fill the middle meatus with surgicel and cortisporin otic. we will also apply an external denver splint with sterile tape and mastisol. do you have any questions about the procedure details?
[patient] no, i don't have any questions.
[doctor] okay, then we will proceed with the surgery as planned.","[doctor] hey there, how're you feeling today?

"[doctor] hello, how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] hi, doctor. i'm feeling okay, a little sore, but i expected that.
[doctor] that's good to hear. i just wanted to go over some details with you about the procedure. we released the a1 pulley in your right thumb to treat the stenosing tendinosis, also known as trigger finger. during the procedure, there was some thickening of the a1 pulley and a fibrous nodule within the flexor tendon of your thumb, which was causing the triggering sensation. we were able to release the pulley and inspect the tendon, which did not show any signs of gross tear.
[patient] okay, that all sounds good.
[doctor] we used iv regional anesthesia with sedation and there were no complications during the procedure. the estimated blood loss was minimal and the tourniquet was applied for approximately 20 minutes at 250 mmhg. after the procedure, your thumb was warm and pink with good capillary refill, and you were transferred to recovery in stable condition.
[patient] thank you for letting me know.
[doctor] of course. it's important for you to know what we did during the procedure and what to expect during your recovery. you may experience some soreness and swelling, but that should subside within a few days. i recommend keeping your hand elevated and applying ice to help with any discomfort. we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to make sure everything is healing properly.

[patient] no, not really. i just want to know the results when they're ready.
[doctor] of course, we will be in touch with you as soon as we receive the results. the biopsy went well with no complications. we were able to remove a portion of the lesion and surrounding tissue for testing. we used pressure to stop any bleeding, and the area was sutured closed. you tolerated the procedure very well. you should come back in about five days to have the sutures removed and to discuss the results.

"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after your procedure?
[patient] hello, i'm doing alright, just a bit uncomfortable.
[doctor] that's understandable. i wanted to go over your procedure with you. you had an insertion of a radioactive plaque in your right eye to treat macular edema. the procedure went well and the placement was confirmed with ophthalmoscopy. we also had to perform a lateral canthotomy.
[patient] what is a lateral canthotomy?
[doctor] it's a small incision made in the outer corner of the eye to relieve pressure in the eye. it's a common procedure done in conjunction with the insertion of the plaque.
[patient] i see.
[doctor] you received a retrobulbar injection of xylocaine to numb the area, and the procedure was done under local anesthesia. we also irrigated the eye with neosporin to prevent infection. your intraocular pressure was found to be within normal limits.

"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the surgery?

[doctor] that's normal after a surgery like this. let me go over the notes from your procedure. it looks like you had papillary carcinoma of the follicular variant of the thyroid in the right lobe and had a right hemithyroidectomy. they also found a lump in the inferior aspect of your thyroid gland and reimplanted a parathyroid gland in the left lower sternocleidomastoid region. do you have any questions about these findings?
[patient] no, not at the moment.
[doctor] alright, and during the procedure, you were placed under general anesthesia and the doctors made an incision through the old scar, then dissected the thyroid gland off the parathyroid gland and the berry ligament. the superior and inferior thyroid vessels were then crossed with the harmonic scalpel and removed. there was a small nick in the external jugular vein that was tied with a suture ligature. the laryngeal nerve was seen and intact, and a rubber band drain was placed along the thyroid bed. does that sound familiar to what you were told before the surgery?

[doctor] mm-hmm, that's great news. so, we performed a talc pleurodesis to prevent the recurrence of the pleural effusion. how much fluid were you draining before this procedure?
[patient] uh, i was draining up to 1.5 liters of serous fluid a day.
[doctor] wow, that's a lot of fluid. hopefully, this procedure will help prevent it from coming back. we used conscious sedation during the procedure to keep you calm and comfortable. how did you feel during the procedure?
[patient] um, i felt okay. i was awake but calm.
[doctor] that's good to hear. we clamped the chest tube and inserted a solution of normal saline containing talc and lidocaine into your right chest to prevent the recurrence of the effusion. we took care that no air would go in to create a pneumothorax. you were turned from your left lateral decubitus position to the right lateral decubitus position for 5 minutes each. you were then given additional medication for pain control. did you experience any discomfort during the procedure?
[patient] um, i did complain of pain that was around 7/10, but it was brought under control quickly.
[doctor] i'm glad we were able to manage your pain. you did very well during the procedure. we have unclamped the chest tube, and you will get a chest x-ray in the morning to ensure that everything is okay. any questions or concerns?
[patient] no, i don't have any questions or concerns. thank you for taking good care of me, doctor.
[doctor] of course, it was my pleasure to help you. don't hesitate to call us if you need anything. get some rest now.",1
"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?
[patient] i'm feeling okay, a bit sore though.
[doctor] that's normal after the procedure you had. the surgery went well, and we were able to remove the infected pilonidal cyst. you were placed under spinal anesthesia and we followed the usual time-out process to ensure everything was in order. 
[patient] that's good to hear. 
[doctor] yes, and during the procedure, we noticed that the abscess had drained somewhat during the night, which made the excision of infected tissues easier. 
[patient] oh, i see.
[doctor] we were able to achieve hemostasis with a cautery, and the wound was irrigated with normal saline. finally, we packed it open with iodoform gauze and an absorptive dressing. 
[patient] okay.
[doctor] you were sent to the recovery room in satisfactory condition, with minimal estimated blood loss. how are you feeling now?
[patient] a bit sore and uncomfortable, but i'm managing.
[doctor] that's understandable. we will prescribe pain medication to help with the pain. make sure to keep the wound clean and dry, and follow up with us in a week for a wound check. call us if you have any concerns or notice any signs of infection, such as increased pain, redness, or drainage from the wound.

"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] i'm a little sore, but i'm doing okay.
[doctor] good to hear. i wanted to go over the details of the procedure we performed. we inserted a 12-french pigtail catheter in your left pleural space to drain fluid and rule out any empyema. we were able to drain at least 400 ml of fluid while we were in the minor or. samples were sent for culture and sensitivity testing. 
[patient] okay, what happens next?
[doctor] you and i decided it would be best for you to stay overnight for observation. we want to make sure there are no complications and that the fluid doesn't continue to build up. the post-procedure chest x-ray looked good, so that's a good sign. 
[patient] makes sense. is there anything i need to do while i'm here?
[doctor] just relax and rest. we'll be monitoring your vitals and making sure everything is stable. you may feel some soreness at the site where the catheter was inserted, but that should improve over time. we'll also be keeping an eye on the fluid drainage and any lab results that come back. 
[patient] okay, sounds good. 
[doctor] if you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to let me or the nursing staff know. we want to make sure you're as comfortable as possible.

[patient] no, not at the moment.
[doctor] okay, let me explain what we did during the operation. you were under topical anesthesia with monitored anesthesia care. we made a small incision close to the limbus at the 1 o'clock position and injected xylocaine 1% preservative-free 0.25 ml into the anterior chamber. we then used a keratome to make another incision close to the limbus at the 9 o'clock position. anterior capsulorrhexis was performed with the utrata forceps, and the nucleus was broken up into 4 pieces with the phaco tip and the drysdale hook. after that, we polished the posterior capsule with a curette polisher and inserted the posterior chamber intraocular lens model sn60wf power +19.50 into the capsular bag. we then instilled some eye drops and covered the eye with a shield. there were no complications, and you tolerated the procedure well.

[patient] okay, what is the purpose of those injections?
[doctor] the purpose of the phenol neurolysis is to treat spasticity in your right hemiparetic cerebral palsy by blocking the nerve impulses. the botulinum toxin injections were also done to help with spasticity by weakening the muscles in the targeted areas.

[doctor] mm-hmm, that's normal. i just wanted to go over some details with you. so, we successfully performed a cataract extraction with phacoemulsification and posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation on your right eye. everything went smoothly and there were no complications during the procedure. 
[patient] oh, good to hear.
[doctor] we used a me 30, ac 25.0 diopter lens during the surgery. we used a local 2%, peribulbar lidocaine for anesthesia, and you were stable throughout the operation. 
[patient] got it.
[doctor] after prepping and draping your right eye in the normal sterile fashion, we used a 2.8 mm metal keratome blade to make a clear corneal beveled incision temporally. we then performed a circular capsulorrhexis and hydrodissection of the nucleus. we removed the nuclear material via phacoemulsification and then removed the residual cortex via irrigation and aspiration. the posterior capsule was clear and intact, and the capsular bag was filled with provisc solution. we secured the wound with one 10-0 nylon suture, and you had a patch placed on your eye. 
[patient] okay, got it.
[doctor] we placed one drop of 5% povidone-iodine prep into your eye, as well as a drop of vigamox and tobradex ointment. everything looks good, and the patch can be removed in a day or two. 
[patient] alright, sounds good.
[doctor] if you experience any unusual pain, redness, or vision changes, please contact us immediately. otherwise, we'll see you for your follow-up appointment in a few days. 
[patient] alright, thank you doctor.",1
"[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] i'm feeling okay, a bit groggy still.
[doctor] that's normal. i wanted to go over the details of your procedure. we performed a phacoemulsification with intraocular lens placement, using topical anesthesia drops to numb the eye. we also dilated the eye and prepped it with a betadine solution to ensure sterility. a wire speculum was placed in the eye, and a corneal incision was made to instill anesthetic drops and viscoelastic to fill the chamber.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] then, a 2.8-mm keratome was used to create a self-sealing corneal incision, and the utrata forceps were used to perform continuous tear capsulorrhexis. we used a quartering and cracking technique to remove the nucleus and then removed the residual cortex. the lens was then inserted into the capsular bag and was shown to center well.
[patient] wow, that sounds complicated.
[doctor] it can be, but it was a routine procedure. we also injected miochol to cause pupillary constriction, and the wound was shown to be watertight. we placed a suture across the incision, applied tobradex ointment, and a fox shield.
[patient] okay, got it.
[doctor] you tolerated the procedure well, and there were no complications. how is your vision right now?
[patient] it's a bit blurry, but i'm not in any pain.
[doctor] that's normal. we will monitor your vision and make sure everything heals up well. do you have any questions or concerns?
[patient] no, not at the moment.
[doctor] okay, well i will give you some discharge instructions to follow, and we will schedule a follow-up appointment to make sure everything is healing according to plan.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the procedure?

"[doctor] hi there. how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] hello. i feel pretty good, a little blurry in the right eye, but otherwise okay.
[doctor] that's to be expected, but the blurriness should subside over the next few days. the surgery went well, and we were able to successfully remove the cataract from your right eye.
[patient] that's great to hear.
[doctor] we used a technique called phacoemulsification with intraocular lens insertion. during the procedure, we made a small incision in your eye and used a special tool to break up and remove the cloudy lens. we then replaced it with a clear, artificial lens to help improve your vision. 
[patient] interesting. did everything go smoothly during the surgery?
[doctor] yes, everything went exactly as planned. there were no complications, and the wound was found to be watertight. you received a retrobulbar block anesthesia which numbed the area around your eye.
[patient] that's good to hear. what's next for me?
[doctor] for the next few days, you'll need to use eye drops to help prevent infection and reduce inflammation. you will also need to wear an eye shield while sleeping to protect the eye. we'll schedule a follow-up appointment in a week to check on your progress and make sure everything is healing well.
[patient] alright. thank you, doctor.
[doctor] of course, don't hesitate to contact us if you notice any changes in your vision or experience any pain.","[doctor] hey, how are you feeling after the procedure?

"[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after your cataract surgery?
[patient] i'm feeling alright, a little groggy still.
[doctor] that's understandable, you just had a procedure done. before we get into the details, did you experience any complications during the surgery or after?
[patient] no, everything seemed to go smoothly.
[doctor] great to hear. so during the surgery, we used a phacoemulsification technique to remove the cataract in your right eye, followed by implanting an alcon ma30ba lens. we used a topical 4% lidocaine with 1% nonpreserved intracameral lidocaine for anesthesia. you were counseled about the risks and benefits of the procedure beforehand and you understood them clearly. how has your vision been since the procedure?
[patient] my vision is still a little blurry, but i can already tell it's better than before the surgery.
[doctor] that's a good sign. we used viscoat solution and provisc solution during the procedure to assist with the removal and insertion of the lens. we also made sure to keep the posterior capsule intact, and the lens is well-centered in the capsular bag. we applied subconjunctival injections of ancef, dexamethasone and lidocaine and maxitrol ointment to aid in your recovery. we'll schedule a follow-up appointment for you tomorrow to make sure everything is healing properly.

[patient] it went well, thank you.
[doctor] great, i'm glad to hear that. can you tell me more about the reason why you had the surgery?
[patient] yes, i was having difficulty with my eyesight, especially with activities of daily living. my visual acuity had been gradually declining and it was believed to be related to the cataract in my right eye.
[doctor] i see. did you have any concerns or questions about the procedure beforehand?
[patient] well, i was aware of the risks involved, such as pain, bleeding, infection, and loss of vision or eye. the possibility of needing further surgery or prolonged eye drop use was also discussed. but i understood the risks and decided to proceed with the surgery.
[doctor] i'm glad that you were well-informed and comfortable with the decision. can you walk me through the procedure?
[patient] sure. i was given sedation and a retrobulbar block before the surgery. the surgeon made a clear corneal incision and used ultrasound to remove the cataract. an intraocular lens was then implanted into the capsular bag. afterward, the incision site was checked for leaks and i was given eye drops and a patch for protection.
[doctor] it sounds like everything went smoothly. were you given any instructions to follow after the surgery?
[patient] yes, the nurse gave me instructions on how to take care of my eye and avoid certain activities. i also have to use eye drops and wear the patch for a certain amount of time. and i have a follow-up appointment in 24 hours.

[patient] okay, that's good to hear.
[doctor] we used topical anesthesia, meaning we numbed the eye with drops instead of giving you general anesthesia. we made a small incision at the limbus and then used a keratome to enter the anterior chamber of the eye.
[patient] uh-huh.
[doctor] we filled the chamber with lidocaine and then with provisc to make it easier to remove the cataract. we used a cystotome to make a small opening in the front of the lens and then removed the cataract using phacoemulsification, which uses sound waves to break up the cataract and suction to remove it.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] we then polished the capsular bag, or the remaining part of the lens, and inserted an intraocular lens. after removing the viscoelastic, we checked the wound and it was watertight.
[patient] is there anything i need to do now?
[doctor] you'll need to use tobradex drops, which are an antibiotic and steroid eye drop, to help prevent infection and reduce inflammation. we'll also give you a shield to wear over your eye to protect it as it heals.
