Stick to the following rules:
1. Keep the conversation colloquial, without using abbreviations and medical jargon.
2. Make sure to include all relevant information from the note, but keep the tone conversational.
3. Add fillers like "um", "uh" and "mm-hmm" that would be normal in a casual conversation.
4. If any medical terms appear in the note, paraphrase them to lay mans terms. For example, the abbreviation "LBP" should be paraphrased to "lower back pain".
5. Do not include any false information in the conversation that is not mentioned in the input clinical note provided
