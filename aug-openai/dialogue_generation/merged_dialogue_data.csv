ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
The patient is suffering from multilevel lumbar internal disc disruption as well as an element of lumbar facet joint syndrome.  Her lumbar facet joints were denervated approximately 6 months ago.  The denervation procedure helped her axial back pain approximately 40% when standing.  With extension and rotation it helped her axial back pain approximately 70%.  She is now able to swing a golf club.  She was unable to swing a golf club due to the rotational movements before her rhizotomy.  She is currently playing golf.  Her L4 radicular symptoms have resolved since her therapeutic transforaminal injection.
I am going to have her fitted with a low profile back brace and I am starting her on diclofenac 75 mg p.o. b.i.d.  We will follow her up in 1 month's time.

This is a 62-year-old right-handed now left-handed white female with tremor since 5th grade.  She remembers that the tremors started in her right hand around that time subsequently later on in early 20s she was put on propranolol for the tremor and more recently within the last 10 years she has been put on primidone and clonazepam.  She thinks that her clonazepam is helping her a lot especially with anxiety and stress, and this makes the tremor better.  She has a lot of trouble with her writing because of tremor but does not report as much problem with other activities of daily living like drinking from a cup and doing her day-to-day activity.  Since around 6 to 7 years, she has had a head tremor, which is mainly ""no- no"" and occasional voice tremor also.

No facial swelling.  No tongue or lip swelling.  No shortness of breath, wheezing, or other associated symptoms.  He cannot think of anything that could have triggered this off.

VITAL SIGNS:  The patient was afebrile.  He is slightly tachycardic, 105, but stable blood pressure and respiratory rate.  GENERAL:  The patient is in no distress.  Sitting quietly on the gurney.  HEENT:  Unremarkable.  His oral mucosa is moist and well hydrated.  Lips and tongue look normal.  Posterior pharynx is clear.  NECK:  Supple.  His trachea is midline.  There is no stridor.

IMPRESSION:
ACUTE ALLERGIC REACTION WITH URTICARIA AND PRURITUS.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
The patient has what looks to be some type of allergic reaction, although the underlying cause is difficult to assess.  He will make sure he goes home to look around to see if there is in fact anything that changed recently that could have triggered this off.  In the meantime, I think he can be managed with some antihistamine over-the-counter.  He is responding already to Benadryl and the epinephrine that we gave him here.  He is told that if he develops any respiratory complaints, shortness of breath, wheezing, or tongue or lip swelling he will return immediately for evaluation.  He is discharged in stable condition.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling now?

[patient] um, yeah, that sounds good. thank you.
[doctor] you're welcome. just keep in mind that this isn't a quick fix, and it will require a lot of work from you. but i think it could help you achieve your goals and improve your health. let's work together to make it happen.",15
"CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Bladder cancer.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male with a history of gross hematuria.  The patient presented to the emergency room near his hometown on 12/24/2007 for evaluation of this gross hematuria.  CT scan was performed, which demonstrated no hydronephrosis or upper tract process; however, there was significant thickening of the left and posterior bladder wall.  Urology referral was initiated and the patient was sent to be evaluated by Dr. X. He eventually underwent a bladder biopsy on 01/18/08, which demonstrated high-grade transitional cell carcinoma without any muscularis propria in the specimen.  Additionally, the patient underwent workup for a right adrenal lesion, which was noted on the initial CT scan.  This workup involved serum cortisol analysis as well as potassium and aldosterone and ACTH level measurement.  All of this workup was found to be grossly negative.  Secondary to the absence of muscle in the specimen, the patient was taken back to the operating room on 02/27/08 by Dr. X and the tumor was noted to be very large with significant tumor burden as well as possible involvement of the bladder neck.  At that time, the referring urologist determined the tumor to be too large and risky for local resection, and the patient was referred to ABCD Urology for management and diagnosis.  The patient presents today for evaluation by Dr. Y.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Includes condyloma, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, undiagnosed COPD, peripheral vascular disease, and claudication.  The patient denies coronary artery disease.

The patient states that she began with right hip pain getting steadily worse over the last 2 years and has now developed some pain in the left hip.  The pain is located laterally as well as anteriorly into the groin.  She states that the pain is present during activities such as walking, and she does get some painful popping and clicking in the right hip.  She is here for evaluation for the first time.  She sought no previous medical attention for this.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Significant for depression and reflux disease.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
Cesarean section x 2.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
Listed in the chart and reviewed with the patient.
ALLERGIES:
The patient has no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient is married.  She is employed as an office manager.  She does smoke cigarettes, one pack per day for the last 20 years.  She consumes alcohol 3 to 5 drinks daily.  She uses no illicit drugs.  She exercises monthly mainly walking and low impact aerobics.  She also likes to play softball.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Significant for occasional indigestion and nausea as well as anxiety and depression.  The remainder of the systems negative.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
The patient is 5 foot, 2 inches tall, weighs 155 pounds.  The patient ambulates independently without an assist device with normal stance and gait.  Inspection of the hips reveals normal contour and appearance and good symmetry.  The patient is able to do an active straight leg raise against gravity and against resistance bilaterally.  She has no significant trochanteric tenderness.  She does, however, have some tenderness in the groin bilaterally.  There is no crepitus present with passive or active range of motion of the hips.  She is grossly neurologically intact in the bilateral lower extremities.
DIAGNOSTIC DATA:
X-rays performed today in the clinic include an AP view of the pelvis and a frog-leg lateral of the right hip.  There are no acute findings.  No fractures or dislocations.  There are minimal degenerative changes noted in the joint.  There is, however, the suggestion of an exostosis on the superior femoral neck, which could be consistent with femoroacetabular impingement.
IMPRESSION:
Bilateral hip pain, right worse than left, possibly suggesting femoroacetabular impingement based on x-rays and her clinical picture is also consistent with possible labral tear.
PLAN:
After discussing possible diagnoses with the patient, I have recommended that we get MRI arthrograms of the bilateral hips to evaluate the anatomy and especially concentrating on the labrum in the right hip.  We will get that done as soon as possible.  In the meantime, she is asked to moderate her activities.  She will follow up as soon as the MRIs are performed.","[doctor] hi there, how can i help you today?

"CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Here with a concern of possibly issues of short-term memory loss.  She is under exceeding amount of stress over the last 5 to 10 years.  She has been a widow over the last 11 years.  Her husband died in an MVA from a drunk driver accident.  She had previously worked at the bank in Conway Springs in Norwich and had several other jobs related to accounting or management services.  She does have an MBA in business.  Currently, she works at T-Mobile Customer Service, and there is quite a bit of technical knowledge, deadlines, and stress related to that job as well.  She feels she has trouble at times absorbing all that she needs to learn as far as the computer skills, protocols, customer service issues, etc.  She describes the job is very demanding and high stress.  She denies any history of weakness, lethargy, or dizziness.  No history of stroke.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Review of systems is otherwise negative.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Vital Signs:  Age:  60.  Weight:  192 pounds.  Blood pressure:  134/80.  Temperature:  97.8 degrees.

IMPRESSION:

2.  Anxiety stress issues.
PLAN:
Thirty-minute face-to-face appointment in counseling with the patient.  At length discussion on her numerous stress issues which can certainly cause a loss of concentration and inability to learn.  The current job she is at does sound extremely stressful and demanding.  I think her stress reactions to these as far as feeling frustrated are within normal limits.  We did complete a mini mental state exam including clock drawing, sentence writing, signature, etc.  She does score a maximum score of 30/30 and all other tasks were completed without difficulty or any hesitation.  I did spend quite a bit of time reassuring her as well.  She is currently on Zoloft 100 mg which I think is an appropriate dose.  We will have her continue on that.  She did verbalize understanding and that she actually felt better after our discussion concerning these issues.  At some point in time; however, I would possibly recommend job change if this one would persist as far as the stress levels.  She is going to think about that.","[doctor] hi, how are you doing today?

"CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Nausea.
PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 28-year-old, who is status post gastric bypass surgery nearly one year ago.  He has lost about 200 pounds and was otherwise doing well until yesterday evening around 7:00-8:00 when he developed nausea and right upper quadrant pain, which apparently wrapped around toward his right side and back.  He feels like he was on it but has not done so.  He has overall malaise and a low-grade temperature of 100.3.  He denies any prior similar or lesser symptoms.  His last normal bowel movement was yesterday.  He denies any outright chills or blood per rectum.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Significant for hypertension and morbid obesity, now resolved.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
Gastric bypass surgery in December 2007.
MEDICATIONS:
Multivitamins and calcium.
ALLERGIES:
None known.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Positive for diabetes mellitus in his father, who is now deceased.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
He denies tobacco or alcohol.  He has what sounds like a data entry computer job.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Otherwise negative.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
His temperature is 100.3, blood pressure 129/59, respirations 16, heart rate 84.  He is drowsy, but easily arousable and appropriate with conversation.  He is oriented to person, place, and situation.  He is normocephalic, atraumatic.  His sclerae are anicteric.  His mucous membranes are somewhat tacky.  His neck is supple and symmetric.  His respirations are unlabored and clear.  He has a regular rate and rhythm.  His abdomen is soft.  He has diffuse right upper quadrant tenderness, worse focally, but no rebound or guarding.  He otherwise has no organomegaly, masses, or abdominal hernias evident.  His extremities are symmetrical with no edema.  His posterior tibial pulses are palpable and symmetric.  He is grossly nonfocal neurologically.
STUDIES:
His white blood cell count is 8.4 with 79 segs.  His hematocrit is 41.  His electrolytes are normal.  His bilirubin is 2.8.  His AST 349, ALT 186, alk-phos 138 and lipase is normal at 239.
ASSESSMENT:
Choledocholithiasis, ? cholecystitis.
PLAN:
He will be admitted and placed on IV antibiotics.  We will get an ultrasound this morning.  He will need his gallbladder out, probably with intraoperative cholangiogram.  Hopefully, the stone will pass this way.  Due to his anatomy, an ERCP would prove quite difficult if not impossible unless laparoscopic assisted.  Dr. X will see him later this morning and discuss the plan further.  The patient understands.","[doctor]: hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient]: i'm feeling really nauseous and i have a lot of pain in my upper right quadrant.

"CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Recurrent nasal obstruction.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 5-year-old male, who was last evaluated by Dr. F approximately one year ago for suspected nasal obstruction, possible sleep apnea.  Dr. F's assessment at that time was the patient not had sleep apnea and did not truly even seem to have allergic rhinitis.  All of his symptoms had resolved when he had seen Dr. F, so no surgical plan was made and no further followup was needed.  However, the patient reports again today with his mother that they are now having continued symptoms of nasal obstruction and questionable sleep changes.  Again, the mother gives a very confusing sleep history but it does not truly sound like the child is having apneic events that are obstructive in nature.  It sounds like he is snoring loudly and does have some nasal obstruction at nighttime.  He also is sniffing a lot through his nose.  He has been tried on some nasal steroids but they only use this on a p.r.n. basis about one or two days every month and we are unsure if that has even helped at all, probably not.  The child is not having any problems with his ears including ear infections or hearing.  He is also not having any problems with strep throat.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Eczema.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
None.
MEDICATIONS:
None.
ALLERGIES:
No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:
No family history of bleeding diathesis or anesthesia difficulties.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  Weight 43 pounds, height 37 inches, temperature 97.4, pulse 65, and blood pressure 104/48.
GENERAL:  The patient is a well-nourished male in no acute distress.  Listening to his voice today in the clinic, he does not sound to have a hyponasal voice and has a wide range of consonant pronunciation.
NOSE:  Anterior rhinoscopy does demonstrate boggy turbinates bilaterally with minimal amount of watery rhinorrhea.
EARS:  The patient tympanic membranes are clear and intact bilaterally.  There is no middle ear effusion.
ORAL CAVITY:  The patient has 2+ tonsils bilaterally.  There are clearly nonobstructive.  His uvula is midline.
NECK:  No lymphadenopathy appreciated.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
This is a 5-year-old male, who presents for repeat evaluation of a possible nasal obstruction, questionable sleep apnea.  Again, the mother gives a confusing sleep history but it does not really sound like he is having apneic events.  They deny any actual gasping events.  It sounds like true obstructive events.  He clearly has some symptoms at this point that would suggest possible allergic rhinitis or chronic rhinitis.  I think the most appropriate way to proceed would be to first try this child on a nasal corticosteroid and use it appropriately.  I have given them prescription for Nasacort Aqua one spray to each nostril twice a day.  I instructed them on correct way to use this and the importance to use it on a daily basis.  They may not see any benefit for several weeks.  I would like to evaluate him in six weeks to see how we are progressing.  If he continues to have problems, I think at that point we may consider performing a transnasal exam in the office to examine his adenoid bed and that would really be the only surgical option for this child.  He may also need an allergy evaluation at that point if he continues to have problems.  However, I would like to be fairly conservative in this child.  Should the mother still have concerns regarding his sleeping at our next visit or should his symptoms worsen (I did instruct her call us if it worsens), we may even need to pursue a sleep study just to settle that issue once and for all.  We will see him back in six weeks.","[doctor] hi there, how are you?
[patient's mother] hi, i'm good. this is my son, he is having some nasal obstruction.
[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?
[patient] i'm okay.
[doctor] so, i see here that you were last evaluated by dr. f for this about a year ago. can you tell me more about what's been going on since then?
[patient's mother] yes, he's been having continued symptoms of nasal obstruction, and we're not sure if he's having sleep changes or not. he snores loudly and has some nasal obstruction at night.
[doctor] i see. has he been tried on any treatments for this?
[patient's mother] yes, we've tried nasal steroids but only on a p.r.n. basis, and we're not sure if it's helped at all.
[doctor] okay, i think the most appropriate course of action here would be to try him on a nasal corticosteroid and use it appropriately. i'll prescribe nasacort aqua, one spray to each nostril twice a day. make sure to use it on a daily basis, and you may not see any benefit for several weeks. i'd also like to evaluate him in six weeks to see how we're progressing. if he continues to have problems, we may consider performing a transnasal exam in the office to examine his adenoid bed, which would be the only surgical option for this child. he may also need an allergy evaluation at that point if he continues to have problems. however, i'd like to be fairly conservative in his treatment. if his symptoms worsen or if you have any concerns regarding his sleep, please call us and we may need to pursue a sleep study. does that sound good?

The patient appears to be an excellent candidate for surgery and would benefit greatly from surgical weight loss in the management of her obesity-related comorbidities.
PLAN:
In preparation for surgery, we will obtain the usual baseline laboratory values including baseline vitamin levels.  I recommended the patient undergo an upper GI series prior to surgery due to find her upper GI anatomy.  Also the patient will meet with the dietitian and psychologist as per her usual routine.  I have recommended approximately six to eight weeks of Medifast for the patient to obtain a 10% preoperative weight loss in preparation for surgery.","[doctor] hi, ms. a. how are you feeling today?
[patient] hello, doctor. i'm doing okay, thank you.
[doctor] so, i see that you've been trying to lose weight for a long time, but haven't been successful. is that right?
[patient] yes, that's correct. i've tried many different weight loss programs, but nothing has worked long-term.
[doctor] i understand. based on your medical history and current weight, i think you would be a good candidate for laparoscopic roux-en-y gastric bypass surgery. have you heard of this procedure before?
[patient] yes, i have. i've been considering it for a while now.
[doctor] great. in preparation for the surgery, we will need to get some baseline laboratory values and vitamin levels. we will also need to do an upper gi series to assess your upper gi anatomy. additionally, you will meet with a dietitian and a psychologist as part of your usual routine.
[patient] okay, that makes sense.
[doctor] i also recommend approximately six to eight weeks of the medifast program to help you lose 10% of your preoperative weight. this will help prepare your body for the surgery and reduce any potential complications.
[patient] okay, i can do that. is there anything else i need to know about the surgery?
[doctor] the surgery itself is minimally invasive and typically takes a few hours to complete. you will need to stay in the hospital for a few days afterwards, and your diet will need to be adjusted accordingly. we will closely monitor your progress and make sure you are healing properly.
[patient] okay, that sounds good. when can we schedule the surgery?
[doctor] we can schedule the surgery once we have completed all of the necessary evaluations and testing. in the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to me or my staff.
[patient] thank you, doctor. i appreciate your help.
[doctor] you're welcome. we will work together to help you achieve your weight loss goals and improve your overall health.","[doctor] hi, ms. a. how are you feeling today?

"PROBLEMS AND ISSUES:
1.  Headaches, nausea, and dizziness, consistent with a diagnosis of vestibular migraine, recommend amitriptyline for prophylactic treatment and Motrin for abortive treatment.
2.  Some degree of peripheral neuropathy, consistent with diabetic neuropathy, encouraged her to watch her diet and exercise daily.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient comes in for a neurology consultation regarding her difficult headaches, tunnel vision, and dizziness.  I obtained and documented a full history and physical examination.  I reviewed the new patient questionnaire, which she completed prior to her arrival today.  I also reviewed the results of tests, which she had brought with her.
Briefly, she is a 60-year-old woman initially from Ukraine, who had headaches since age 25.  She recalls that in 1996 when her husband died her headaches became more frequent.  They were pulsating.  She was given papaverine, which was successful in reducing the severity of her symptoms.  After six months of taking papaverine, she no longer had any headaches.  In 2004, her headaches returned.  She also noted that she had ""zig-zag lines"" in her vision.  Sometimes she would not see things in her peripheral visions.  She had photophobia and dizziness, which was mostly lightheadedness.  On one occasion she almost had a syncope.  Again she has started taking Russian medications, which did help her.  The dizziness and headaches have become more frequent and now occur on average once to twice per week.  They last two hours since she takes papaverine, which stops the symptoms within 30 minutes.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Her past medical history is significant for injury to her left shoulder, gastroesophageal reflux disorder, diabetes, anxiety, and osteoporosis.
MEDICATIONS:
Her medications include hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, glipizide, metformin, vitamin D, Centrum multivitamin tablets, Actos, lorazepam as needed, Vytorin, and Celexa.
ALLERGIES:
She has no known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:
There is family history of migraine and diabetes in her siblings.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
She drinks alcohol occasionally.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Her review of systems was significant for headaches, pain in her left shoulder, sleeping problems and gastroesophageal reflex symptoms.  Remainder of her full 14-point review of system was unremarkable.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
On examination, the patient was pleasant.  She was able to speak English fairly well.  Her blood pressure was 130/84.  Heart rate was 80.  Respiratory rate was 16.  Her weight was 188 pounds.  Her pain score was 0/10.  Her general exam was completely unremarkable.  Her neurological examination showed subtle weakness in her left arm due to discomfort and pain.  She had reduced vibration sensation in her left ankle and to some degree in her right foot.  There was no ataxia.  She was able to walk normally.  Reflexes were 2+ throughout.
She had had a CT scan with constant, which per Dr. X's was unremarkable.  She reports that she had a brain MRI two years ago which was also unremarkable.
IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
The patient is a delightful 60-year-old chemist from Ukraine who has had episodes of headaches with nausea, photophobia, and dizziness since her 20s.  She has had some immigration problems in recent months and has experienced increased frequency of her migraine symptoms.  Her diagnosis is consistent with vestibular migraine.  I do not see evidence of multiple sclerosis, Ménière's disease, or benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.
I talked to her in detail about the importance of following a migraine diet.  I gave her instructions including a list of foods times, which worsen migraine.  I reviewed this information for more than half the clinic visit.  I would like to start her on amitriptyline at a dose of 10 mg at time.  She will take Motrin at a dose of 800 mg as needed for her severe headaches.
She will make a diary of her migraine symptoms so that we can find any triggering food items, which worsen her symptoms.  I encouraged her to walk daily in order to improve her fitness, which helps to reduce migraine symptoms.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] not too good, doctor. i've been having headaches, nausea, and dizziness again.
[doctor] i understand. i reviewed your medical history and test results. it seems like you've been experiencing these symptoms for a while now. do you recall when they started?
[patient] yes, i've had these headaches since i was 25. they became more frequent after my husband passed away in 1996. the headaches were pulsating, and i also had ""zig-zag lines"" in my vision at times.
[doctor] i see. based on your symptoms, your diagnosis is consistent with vestibular migraine. i would like to start you on a prophylactic treatment, amitriptyline, at a low dose of 10 mg.  additionally, for abortive treatment, you can take motrin at a dose of 800 mg as needed for your severe headaches. this should provide you with some relief.
[patient] okay, thank you. 
[doctor] i also went over the importance of following a migraine diet with you. remember to avoid foods that worsen your symptoms. keep track of your migraine symptoms in a diary. this will help us identify any triggering food items. i also encouraged you to exercise daily to improve your fitness and reduce migraine symptoms. do you have any questions?

At this time, she complains of pain and instability in the knee.  The patient's past medical history is significant for having had an ACL injury to the knee in 2008.  She underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction by Dr. X at that time, subsequently in the same year she developed laxity of the graft due in part to noncompliance and subsequently, she sought attention from Dr. Y who performed a revision ACL reconstruction at the end of 2008.  The patient states she rehabbed the knee well after that and did fine with good stability of the knee until this recent injury.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
She claims no chronic illnesses.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
She had an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in 03/2008, and subsequently had a revision ACL reconstruction in 12/2008.  She has also had arm surgery when she was 6 years old.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,GENERAL:  The patient is 4 foot 10 inches tall, weighs 110 pounds.
EXTREMITIES:  She ambulates with some difficulty with a marked limp on the right side.  Inspection of the knee reveals a significant effusion in the knee.  She has difficulty with passive range of motion of the knee secondary to pain.  She does have tenderness to palpation at the medial joint line and has a positive Lachman's exam.
NEUROVASCULAR:  She is neurovascularly intact.
IMPRESSION:
Right knee injury suggestive of a recurrent anterior cruciate ligament tear, possible internal derangement.
PLAN:
The patient will be referred for an MRI of the right knee to evaluate the integrity of her revision ACL graft.  In the meantime, she will continue to use ice as needed.  Moderate her activities and use crutches.  She will follow up as soon as the MRI is performed.","[doctor] hi, i'm dr. x. how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, doctor. i'm not feeling too good, my right knee hurts.

[patient] okay.
[doctor] i see that you have some difficulty walking and a significant effusion in your knee. you also have tenderness to palpation at the medial joint line and a positive lachman's exam. based on your history and physical exam, it suggests that you may have a recurrent anterior cruciate ligament tear or other internal derangement. i'm going to order an mri of your right knee to evaluate the integrity of your revision acl graft. in the meantime, i advise you to use ice as needed, moderate your activities, and use crutches to reduce weight-bearing on the affected knee. you will follow up with me as soon as the mri is performed. do you have any questions or concerns?
[patient] no, i understand. thank you, doctor.","[doctor] hi, i'm dr. x. how are you feeling today?
[patient] um, hi, doctor. i'm not feeling too good, my right knee hurts.
[doctor] okay, can you tell me what happened to your knee?
[patient] so, i was playing tennis three days ago when i injured it. there was no contact, but i felt immediate pain and swelling.
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that. how is the pain now?
[patient] um, it still hurts and my knee feels unstable.
[doctor] okay. i see from your medical records that you had an acl injury to the same knee in 2008. did you receive treatment for it?
[patient] oh, yeah, i had an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction by dr. x at that time, but later on, i had a revision acl reconstruction by dr. y because of laxity of the graft due to noncompliance.
[doctor] i see. how has your knee been since then?
[patient] hmm, it was fine, i had good stability until this recent injury.
[doctor] i understand. i'm going to examine your knee now. please lie down and relax.

"CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Left elbow pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This 17-year-old male was fighting with some other kids in Juvenile Hall when he felt some pain in his left elbow, causing sudden pain.  He also has pain in his left ankle, but he is able to walk normally.  He has had previous pain in his left knee.  He denies any passing out, any neck pain at this time even though he did get hit in the head.  He has no chest or abdominal pain.  Apparently, no knives or guns were involved.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
He has had toe problems and left knee pain in the past.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
No coughing, sputum production, dyspnea or chest pain.  No vomiting or abdominal pain.  No visual changes.  No neurologic deficits other than some numbness in his left hand.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
He is in Juvenile Hall for about 25 more days.  He is a nonsmoker.
ALLERGIES:
MORPHINE.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
Abilify.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  Stable.  HEENT:  PERRLA.  EOMI.  Conjunctivae anicteric.  Skull is normocephalic.  He is not complaining of bruising.  HEENT:  TMs and canals are normal.  There is no Battle sign.  NECK:  Supple.  He has good range of motion.  Spinal processes are normal to palpation.  LUNGS:  Clear.  CARDIAC:  Regular rate.  No murmurs or rubs.  EXTREMITIES:  Left elbow is tender.  He does not wish to move it at all.  Shoulder and clavicle are within normal limits.  Wrist is normal to inspection.  He does have some pain to palpation.  Hand has good capillary refill.  He seems to have decreased sensation in all three dermatomes.  He has moderately good abduction of all fingers.  He has moderate opponens strength with his thumb.  He has very good extension of all of his fingers with good strength.
We did an x-ray of his elbow.  He has a spiral fracture of the distal one-third of the humerus, about 13 cm in length.  The proximal part looks like it is in good position.  The distal part has about 6 mm of displacement.  There is no significant angulation.  The joint itself appears to be intact.  The fracture line ends where it appears above the joint.  I do not see any extra blood in the joint.  I do not see any anterior or posterior Siegert sign.
I spoke with Dr. X.  He suggests we go ahead and splint him up and he will follow the patient up.  At this point, it does not seem like there needs to be any surgical revision.  The chance of a compartment syndrome seems very low at this time.
Using 4-inch Ortho-Glass and two assistants, we applied a posterior splint to immobilize his fingers, hand, and wrist all the way up to his elbow to well above the elbow.
He had much better comfort once this was applied.  There was good color to his fingers and again, much better comfort.
Once that was on, I took some 5-inch Ortho-Glass and put in extra reinforcement around the elbow so he would not be moving it, straightening it or breaking the fiberglass.
We then gave him a sling.
We gave him #2 Vicodin p.o. and #4 to go.  Gave him a prescription for #15 more and warned him to take it only at nighttime and use Tylenol or Motrin, and ice in the daytime.
I gave him the name and telephone number of Dr. X whom they can follow up with.  They were warned to come back here if he has increasing neurologic deficits in his hands or any new problems.
DIAGNOSES:
1.  Fracture of the humerus, spiral.
2.  Possible nerve injuries to the radial and median nerve, possibly neurapraxia.
3.  Psychiatric disorder, unspecified.
DISPOSITION:  The patient will follow up as mentioned above.  They can return here anytime as needed.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?

"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with carcinoma of the cervix metastatic to retroperitoneum, lung, which was diagnosed approximately two years ago.  There is a nodule in her lung, which was treated by excision in February of 2007 on the right side.  She had spread to her kidney.  She had right-sided nephrectomy and left-sided nephrostomy.  She also had invasion of the bladder.  Currently, all of her urine comes out through the renal nephrostomy.  She complains of burning vaginal pain, as well as chronic discharge, which has improved slightly recently.  She is not able to engage in intercourse because of the pain and bleeding.  She also has pain with bowel movements, as well as painful urgency.  The pain is at least 3-4/10 and is partially relieved with methadone rescues and interferes with her ability to sleep at night as she feels exhausted and tired.  She has some nausea and diminished appetite.  No hallucinations.  She is anxious frequently and this is helped with clonazepam, which she has taken chronically for her anxiety disorder and recently started Zyprexa.  She has occasional shortness of breath, which used to be helped with oxygen in the hospital.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Peptic ulcer disease, hypertension.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
She has constipation with hard bowel movements.
MEDICATIONS:
Norvasc 10 mg daily, isosorbide 60 mg every 24 hours, olanzapine at 2.5-5 mg in bedtime, clonazepam 1 mg every eight hours, Sorbitol 30 cc twice a day, Senna-S two tabs daily, methadone 60 mg every eight hours, and 30 mg every four hours p.r.n. pain.
ALLERGIES:
She has no known allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient lives with her common law husband and her daughter.  Code Status: DNR.  Religion.  Catholic.  She has a past history of heroin use and was enrolled in MMTP program for 12 hours.  She reports feeling discouraged from her symptoms and pain.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Blood pressure 120/80, pulse 80, and respirations 14.  General Appearance:  Mildly obese woman.  PERRLA, 3 mm.  Oral mucosa moist without lesions.  Lungs:  Clear.  Heart:  RRR without murmurs.  Abdomen:  Somewhat distended, but soft and nontender.  There is firmness found in the low abdomen bilaterally.  There is erythema in the intertriginous area and vulva, as well as some serous discharge from the vagina.  Neurological Exam:  Cranial nerves II through XII are grossly intact.  There is normal tone.  Power is 5-/5.  DTRs nonreactive.  Sensation intact to fine touch.  Mental Status:  The patient is alert, fully oriented, normal speech, and thought process.  Normal affect.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:

1.  Carcinoma of the cervix metastatic to the retroperitoneum, bladder, and lung with irritable obstruction and gradual decline in the performance status.  Given this, her prognosis is likely to be limited to six months and she will benefit from home hospice care.
2.  Pain, which is a combination of somatic nociceptive pain due to the retroperitoneal invasion, as well as a neuropathic component from pelvic and nerve involvement by the surgery as well as radiation therapy and disease itself.  We are going to increase methadone to 70 mg every eight hours and continue 30 mg for breakthrough.  We will add pregabalin 50 mg three times a day and titrate the dose up as needed.
3.  Nausea and poor appetite.  We will start Megace 200 mg daily.
4.  Shortness of breath.  We will provide oxygen p.r.n.

"SUBJECTIVE:
This is an 11-year-old female who comes in for two different things.  1.  She was seen by the allergist.  No allergies present, so she stopped her Allegra, but she is still real congested and does a lot of snorting.  They do not notice a lot of snoring at night though, but she seems to be always like that.  2.  On her right great toe, she has got some redness and erythema.  Her skin is kind of peeling a little bit, but it has been like that for about a week and a half now.

[patient] we are doing well, thank you.
[doctor] great to hear. so, i see that your child has a history of chronic otitis media and adenoid hypertrophy. can you tell me more about his symptoms?
[patient] yes, he has had persistent bouts of ear infections and has been having trouble breathing through his nose.
[doctor] i see. during my examination, i found that there is effusion present bilaterally in his middle ear and his tonsils were 2-3+. due to these findings, i recommend that your child undergoes adenoidectomy and bilateral myringotomy with insertion of pe tubes.
[patient] okay, what does that involve?
[doctor] adenoidectomy is the removal of the adenoids, which are located in the back of the nasal cavity and can become enlarged, causing breathing difficulties. myringotomy involves making a small incision in the eardrum to relieve pressure from fluid buildup and to insert a small tube to help with drainage. the procedure is done under general anesthesia and is typically done on an outpatient basis.
[patient] is there anything we need to do to prepare for the procedure?
[doctor] your child cannot eat or drink anything for a certain period of time before the procedure, so i will give you specific instructions on that. additionally, we will need to ensure that there are no infections present before the procedure, so we will likely conduct some tests.
[patient] okay, that makes sense. is there anything we should expect after the procedure?
[doctor] you can expect some discomfort and some drainage from the ears for a few days after the procedure. we will provide pain management and instructions on how to care for the tubes. we will also schedule a follow-up appointment to ensure that the tubes are functioning properly and that your child's symptoms have improved.
[patient] okay, thank you for explaining everything to us.
[doctor] of course, it's important to us that you understand the procedure and feel comfortable with it. if you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to ask.","[doctor] hi there, how are you and your little one doing today?

"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
A 71-year-old female who I am seeing for the first time.  She has a history of rheumatoid arthritis for the last 6 years.  She was followed by another rheumatologist.  She says she has been off and on, on prednisone and Arava.  The rheumatologist, as per the patient, would not want her to be on a long-term medicine, so he would give her prednisone and then switch to Arava and then switch her back to prednisone.  She says she had been on prednisone for the last 6 to 9 months.  She is on 5 mg a day.  She recently had a left BKA and there was a question of infection, so it had to be debrided.  I was consulted to see if her prednisone is to be continued.  The patient denies any joint pains at the present time.  She says when this started she had significant joint pains and was unable to walk.  She had pain in the hands and feet.  Currently, she has no pain in any of her joints.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Denies photosensitivity, oral or nasal ulcer, seizure, psychosis, and skin rashes.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Significant for hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and left BKA.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Noncontributory.

EXTREMITIES:  No edema.
NEUROLOGIC:  Deferred.
ARTICULAR:  She has swelling of bilateral wrists, but no significant tenderness.
LABORATORY DATA:
Labs in chart was reviewed.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
A 71-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, on longstanding prednisone.  She is not on DMARD, but as she recently had a surgery followed by a probable infection, I will hold off on that.  As she has no pain, I have decreased the prednisone to 2.5 mg a day starting tomorrow if she is to go back to her nursing home tomorrow.  If in a couple of weeks her symptoms stay the same, then I would discontinue the prednisone.  I would defer that to Dr. X.  If she flares up at that point, prednisone may have to be restarted with a DMARD, so that eventually she could stay off the prednisone.  I discussed this at length with the patient and she is in full agreement with the plan.  I explained to her that if she is to be discharged, if she wishes, she could follow up with me in clinic or if she goes back to Victoria, then see her rheumatologist over there.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?

[patient] currently, i have no pain in any of my joints.
[doctor] that's good to hear. during the physical exam, i noticed swelling in your bilateral wrists but no significant tenderness.

[patient] okay, that sounds like a good plan. i'm in full agreement with it.
[doctor] great. if you do experience a flare-up later on, we may need to restart prednisone with a dmard to eventually keep you off of prednisone. do you have any questions or concerns?

"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 91-year-old female who was brought in by family.  Apparently, she was complaining that she felt she might have been poisoned at her care facility.  The daughter who accompanied the patient states that she does not think anything is actually wrong, but she became extremely agitated and she thinks that is the biggest problem with the patient right now.  The patient apparently had a little bit of dry heaves, but no actual vomiting.  She had just finished eating dinner.  No one else in the facility has been ill.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for previous abdominal surgeries.  She has a pacemaker.  She has a history of recent collarbone fracture.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Very difficult to get from the patient herself.  She seems to deny any significant pain or discomfort, but really seems not particularly intent on letting me know what is bothering her.  She initially stated that everything was wrong, but could not specify any specific complaints.  Denies chest pain, back pain, or abdominal pain.  Denies any extremity symptoms or complaints.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a nonsmoker.  She is accompanied here with daughter who brought her over here.  They were visiting the patient when this episode occurred.
MEDICATIONS:  Please see list.
ALLERGIES:  NONE.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  The patient is afebrile, actually has a very normal vital signs including normal pulse oximetry at 99% on room air.  GENERAL:  The patient is an elderly frail looking little lady lying on the gurney.  She is awake, alert, and not really wanted to answer most of the questions I asked her.  She does have a tremor with her mouth, which the daughter states has been there for ""many years"".  HEENT:  Eye exam is unremarkable.  Oral mucosa is still moist and well hydrated.  Posterior pharynx is clear.  NECK:  Supple.  LUNGS:  Actually clear with good breath sounds.  There are no wheezes, no rales, or rhonchi.  Good air movement.  CARDIAC:  Without murmur.  ABDOMEN:  Soft.  I do not elicit any tenderness.  There is no abdominal distention.  Bowel sounds are present in all quadrants.  SKIN:  Skin is without rash or petechiae.  There is no cyanosis.  EXTREMITIES:  No evidence of any trauma to the extremities.
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  I had a long discussion with the family and they would like the patient receive something for agitation, so she was given 0.5 mg of Ativan intramuscularly.  After about half an hour, I came back to talk to the patient and the family, the patient states that she feels better.  Family states she seems more calm.  They do not want to pursue any further workup at this time.
IMPRESSION:  ACUTE EPISODE OF AGITATION.
PLAN:  At this time, I had reviewed the patient's records and it is not particularly enlightening as to what could have triggered off this episode.  The patient herself has good vital signs.  She does not seem to have any specific acute process going on and seemed to feel comfortable after the Ativan was given, a small quantity was given to the patient.  Family and daughter specifically did not want to pursue any workup at this point, which at this point I think is reasonable and we will have her follow up with ABC.  She is discharged in stable condition.","[doctor] hi, i'm dr. [name]. can you tell me what happened to you today?

[patient] yes, i've had it for many years.
[doctor] alright, it looks like everything is okay. i am going to give you something for the agitation and see if that helps. after a while, we can talk about your plan for follow up treatment.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] the medication i am going to give you is ativan. it will help you feel calmer, but might make you feel sleepy or dizzy. is that okay?

"CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Achilles ruptured tendon.
HISTORY:
Mr. XYZ is 41 years of age, who works for Chevron and lives in Angola.  He was playing basketball in Angola back last Wednesday, Month DD, YYYY, when he was driving toward the basket and felt a pop in his posterior leg.  He was seen locally and diagnosed with an Achilles tendon rupture.  He has been on crutches and has been nonweightbearing since that time.  He had no pain prior to his injury.  He has had some swelling that is mild.  He has just been on aspirin a day due to his traveling time.  Pain currently is minimal.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Denies diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or pulmonary disease.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
Malarone, which is an anti-malarial.
ALLERGIES:
NKDA,SOCIAL HISTORY:
He is a petroleum engineer for Chevron.  Drinks socially.  Does not use tobacco.
PHYSICAL EXAM:
Pleasant gentleman in no acute distress.  He has some mild swelling on the right ankle and hindfoot.  He has motion that is increased into dorsiflexion.  He has good plantarflexion.  Good subtalar, Chopart and forefoot motion.  His motor function is intact although weak into plantarflexion.  Sensation is intact.  Pulses are strong.  In the prone position, he has diminished tension on the affected side.  There is some bruising around the posterior heel.  He has a palpable defect about 6-8 cm proximal to the insertion site that is tender for him.  Squeezing the calf causes no plantarflexion of the foot.
RADIOGRAPHS:
Of his right ankle today show a preserved joint space.  I don't see any evidence of fracture noted.  Radiographs of the heel show no fracture noted with good alignment.
IMPRESSION:
Right Achilles tendon rupture.
PLAN:
I have gone over with Mr. XYZ the options available.  We have discussed the risks, benefits and alternatives to operative versus nonoperative treatment.  Based on his age and his activity level, I think his best option is for operative fixation.  We went over the risks of bleeding, infection, damage to nerves and blood vessels, rerupture of the tendon, weakness and the need for future surgery.  We have discussed doing this as an outpatient procedure.  He would be nonweightbearing in a splint for 10 days, nonweightbearing in a dynamic brace for 4 weeks, and then a walking boot for another six weeks with a lift until three months postop when we can get him into a shoe with a ¼"" lift.  He understands a 6-9 month return to sports overall.  He will also need to be on some Lovenox for a week after surgery and then on an aspirin as he is going to travel back to Angola.  Today we will put him in a high tide boot that he will need at six weeks, and we will put him in a 1"" lift also.  He can weight bear until surgery and we will have it set up this week.  His questions were all answered today.","[doctor] hi, mr. xyz. i see from the medical notes that you had a basketball injury and have been diagnosed with an achilles tendon rupture. how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, i am feeling okay. i have been on crutches since the injury and have had some swelling.
[doctor] i can see some mild swelling in your right ankle and hindfoot. can you tell me more about your pain?
[patient] i had no pain before the injury, but it is minimal now.
[doctor] that's good to hear. i have gone through your medical history and physical examination, and it looks like your best option is for operative fixation. we went over the potential risks, benefits, and alternatives to both operative and nonoperative treatment. do you have any questions about the procedure?
[patient] no, not really. what will the recovery process look like?
[doctor] after the surgery, you will need to be nonweightbearing in a splint for 10 days, followed by a dynamic brace for four weeks, and then a walking boot for another six weeks with a lift until three months post-op when we can get you into a shoe with a ¼"" lift. you will also need to be on some lovenox for a week after surgery and then on aspirin as you will be traveling back to angola. overall, it will take 6-9 months until you can return to sports.
[patient] okay, i understand. when would the surgery be?
[doctor] we can have it set up for this week. in the meantime, we will put you in a high tide boot with a 1"" lift that you can weight bear until the surgery. do you have any other questions or concerns?

IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
The patient is admitted with a diagnosis of acute on chronic renal insufficiency, rule out hepatorenal insufficiency could be secondary to congestive heart failure, cardiac cirrhosis, rule out possibility of ascites secondary to mesothelioma because the patient has got history of exposure to asbestos and has got pulmonary nodule, rule out diabetic nephropathy could be secondary to hypertensive nephrosclerosis.  The patient has hematuria could be secondary to benign prostatic hypertrophy, rule out malignancy.  We will do urine for cytology.  We will do a renal ultrasound, and 24-hour urine collection for protein/creatinine, creatinine clearance, immunofixation, serum electrophoresis, serum uric acid, serum iron, TIBC, and serum ferritin levels.

Significant only for asthma.  No history of chest pain normal MI.  He has hypertension.  He occasionally will develop colds especially with weather changes.  GI:  Negative.  GU:  Still making urine about 1-3 times per day.  Musculoskeletal:  Negative.  Skin:  He complains of dry skin.  Neurologic:  Negative.  Psychiatry:  Negative.  Endocrine:  Negative.  Hematology:  Negative.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
A pleasant 41-year-old African-American male who stands 5 feet 6 inches and weighs about 193 pounds.  HEENT:  Anicteric sclera, pink conjunctiva, no cervical lymphadenopathy.  Chest:  Equal chest expansion.  Clear breath sounds.  Heart:  Distinct heart sounds, regular rhythm with no murmur.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, flabby, no organomegaly.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
This is a 49-year old African-American male who was diagnosed with end-stage renal disease secondary to hypertension.  He is on hemodialysis since 02/2008.  Overall, I think that he is a reasonable candidate for a kidney transplantation and should undergo a complete pretransplant workup with pulmonary clearance because of his chronic asthma.  Other than that, I think that he is a reasonable candidate for transplant.
I would like to thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of your patient.  Please feel free to contact me if there are any questions regarding his case.","[doctor] hi there, how are you doing today?
[patient] i’m doing okay, thank you.
[doctor] good to hear. so, i’ve reviewed your medical history and it looks like you’ve been on hemodialysis since 02/2008 due to end-stage renal disease. is that correct?
[patient] yes, that’s correct.
[doctor] okay, and i see you’ve been on several medications, including advair and albuterol for asthma, and cardizem, coreg, hydralazine, lanoxin, crestor, lisinopril, and phoslo. have you been taking them as prescribed?
[patient] yes, i’ve been taking them regularly.
[doctor] great. i also saw that you’re interested in undergoing a kidney transplantation. i believe you’re a good candidate for it. however, before proceeding, we’ll need to perform a complete pretransplant workup and pulmonary clearance since you have chronic asthma. are you okay with that?

"CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Left breast cancer.
HISTORY:
The patient is a 57-year-old female, who I initially saw in the office on 12/27/07, as a referral from the Tomball Breast Center.  On 12/21/07, the patient underwent image-guided needle core biopsy of a 1.5 cm lesion at the 7 o'clock position of the left breast (inferomedial).  The biopsy returned showing infiltrating ductal carcinoma high histologic grade.  The patient stated that she had recently felt and her physician had felt a palpable mass in that area prior to her breast imaging.  She prior to that area, denied any complaints.  She had no nipple discharge.  No trauma history.  She has had been on no estrogen supplementation.  She has had no other personal history of breast cancer.  Her family history is positive for her mother having breast cancer at age 48.  The patient has had no children and no pregnancies.  She denies any change in the right breast.  Subsequent to the office visit and tissue diagnosis of breast cancer, she has had medical oncology consultation with Dr. X and radiation oncology consultation with Dr. Y.  I have discussed the case with Dr. X and Dr. Y, who are both in agreement with proceeding with surgery prior to adjuvant therapy.  The patient's metastatic workup has otherwise been negative with MRI scan and CT scanning.  The MRI scan showed some close involvement possibly involving the left pectoralis muscle, although thought to also possibly represent biopsy artifact.  CT scan of the neck, chest, and abdomen is negative for metastatic disease.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Previous surgery is history of benign breast biopsy in 1972, laparotomy in 1981, 1982, and 1984, right oophorectomy in 1984, and ganglion cyst removal of the hand in 1987.
MEDICATIONS:
She is currently on omeprazole for reflux and indigestion.
ALLERGIES:
SHE HAS NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Negative for any recent febrile illnesses, chest pains or shortness of breath.  Positive for restless leg syndrome.  Negative for any unexplained weight loss and no change in bowel or bladder habits.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Positive for breast cancer in her mother and also mesothelioma from possible asbestosis or asbestos exposure.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient works as a school teacher and teaching high school.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,GENERAL:  The patient is a white female, alert and oriented x 3, appears her stated age of 57.
HEENT:  Head is atraumatic and normocephalic.  Sclerae are anicteric.
NECK:  Supple.
CHEST:  Clear.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.
BREASTS:  Exam reveals an approximately 1.5 cm relatively mobile focal palpable mass in the inferomedial left breast at the 7 o'clock position, which clinically is not fixed to the underlying pectoralis muscle.  There are no nipple retractions.  No skin dimpling.  There is some, at the time of the office visit, ecchymosis from recent biopsy.  There is no axillary adenopathy.  The remainder of the left breast is without abnormality.  The right breast is without abnormality.  The axillary areas are negative for adenopathy bilaterally.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender without masses.  No gross organomegaly.  No CVA or flank tenderness.
EXTREMITIES:  Grossly neurovascularly intact.
IMPRESSION:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast, T1c, Nx, M0 left breast carcinoma.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
I have discussed with the patient in detail about the diagnosis of breast cancer and the surgical options, and medical oncologist has discussed with her issues about adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  We have decided to recommend to the patient breast conservation surgery with left breast lumpectomy with preoperative sentinel lymph node injection and mapping and left axillary dissection.  The possibility of further surgery requiring wider lumpectomy or even completion mastectomy was explained to the patient.  The procedure and risks of the surgery were explained to include, but not limited to extra bleeding, infection, unsightly scar formation, the possibility of local recurrence, the possibility of left upper extremity lymphedema was explained.  Local numbness, paresthesias or chronic pain was explained.  The patient was given an educational brochure and several brochures about the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancers.  She was certainly encouraged to obtain further surgical medical opinions prior to proceeding.  I believe the patient has given full informed consent and desires to proceed with the above.","[doctor] hello, how are you doing today?

"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:
Newly diagnosed cholangiocarcinoma.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a very pleasant 77-year-old female who is noted to have an increase in her liver function tests on routine blood work in December 2009.  Ultrasound of the abdomen showed gallbladder sludge and gallbladder findings consistent with adenomyomatosis.  Common bile duct was noted to be 10 mm in size on that ultrasound.  She then underwent a CT scan of the abdomen in July 2010, which showed intrahepatic ductal dilatation with the common bile duct size being 12.7 mm.  She then underwent an MRI MRCP, which was notable for stricture of the distal common bile duct.  She was then referred to gastroenterology and underwent an ERCP.  On August 24, 2010, she underwent the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.  She was noted to have a stricturing mass of the mid-to-proximal common bile duct consistent with cholangiocarcinoma.  A temporary biliary stent was placed across the biliary stricture.  Blood work was obtained during the hospitalization.  She was also noted to have an elevated CA99.  She comes in to clinic today for initial Medical Oncology consultation.  After she sees me this morning, she has a follow-up consultation with a surgeon.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  In July, she had eye surgery on her left eye for a muscle repair.  Other surgeries include left ankle surgery for a fractured ankle in 2000.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
Diovan 80/12.5 mg daily, Lipitor 10 mg daily, Lutein 20 mg daily, folic acid 0.8 mg daily and multivitamin daily.
ALLERGIES:
No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Notable for heart disease.  She had three brothers that died of complications from open heart surgery.  Her parents and brothers all had hypertension.  Her younger brother died at the age of 18 of infection from a butcher's shop.  He was cutting Argentinean beef and contracted an infection and died within 24 hours.  She has one brother that is living who has angina and a sister who is 84 with dementia.  She has two adult sons who are in good health.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient has been married to her second husband for the past ten years.  Her first husband died in 1995.  She does not have a smoking history and does not drink alcohol.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
The patient reports a change in her bowels ever since she had the stent placed.  She has noted some weight loss, but she notes that that is due to not eating very well.  She has had some mild fatigue, but prior to her diagnosis she had absolutely no symptoms.  As mentioned above, she was noted to have abnormal alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin, AST and ALT, which prompted the followup.  She has had some difficulty with her vision that has improved with her recent surgical procedure.  She denies any fevers, chills, night sweats.  She has had loose stools.  The rest of her review of systems is negative.

If he does not have it now then it should not be a significant risk in the future.  The indications and benefits of EGD, colonoscopy, and IRC were discussed.  The risks including sedation, bleeding, infection, and perforation were discussed.  The importance of a good bowel prep so as to minimize missing any lesions was discussed.  His questions were answered and informed consent obtained.  It was a pleasure to care for this nice patient.","[doctor] hi there, how are you?

Plan today is to make adjustments to her pump based on a total daily dose of 90 units of insulin.  Basal rate is as follows, 12 a.m. 1.5, 02:30 a.m. 1.75, and 6 a.m. 1.5.  Her correction factor is 19.  Her carb/insulin ratio is 6.  Her active insulin time is 5 and her targets are at 12 a.m. 110 and 6 a.m. to midnight is 100.  We made adjustments to her pump and the plan will be to see her back in approximately 2 months.
2.  Hyperlipidemia.  The patient is not taking statin, therefore, we will prescribe Lipitor 20 mg one p.o. once daily.  Have her watch for side effects from the medication and plan to do a fasting lipid panel and CMP approximately 8 weeks from now.
3.  We will get a hemoglobin A1c and spot urine for albumin in 8 weeks as well.","[doctor] hi there! so, you are here for follow-up management of your type 1 diabetes mellitus. how have you been feeling?
[patient] hi! generally, i have been feeling good. but, i had a pump malfunction a couple of weeks ago and had to get a new pump. since then, i have been having difficulty with glycemic control. 
[doctor] i see. are you experiencing any severe hypoglycemic events?
[patient] no, not really. but, i am having difficulty with hyperglycemia both fasting and postprandial.
[doctor] alright, i understand. are you experiencing any other symptoms like polyuria, polydipsia, or polyphagia?
[patient] no, i am not. 
[doctor] are you exercising regularly?
[patient] no, i have not been exercising lately. i have a busy work schedule and a young child to take care of.
[doctor] okay. how about your diet? are you making healthy choices?
[patient] not really. i eat on the run a lot and don't always make the best choices.
[doctor] i see. well, we will help you with that. let's take a look at your medications. you are currently taking zoloft, lisinopril, folic acid and novolog insulin via insulin pump. is that correct?
[patient] yes, that's right. 
[doctor] great. we need to make adjustments to your pump based on a total daily dose of 90 units of insulin. i have made some adjustments to your pump and will see you back in approximately 2 months. also, you have persistent hyperlipidemia with high ldl levels. therefore, i will prescribe lipitor 20 mg once daily. we will monitor your lipid levels and get a hemoglobin a1c and spot urine for albumin in 8 weeks. 
[patient] okay, sounds good. 
[doctor] do you have any questions for me?
[patient] no, i don't have any questions. 
[doctor] alright, then. i will see you in 2 months. take care!","[doctor] hey there! so, how are you feeling with your type 1 diabetes mellitus? 
[patient] hey! um, i've been feeling good mostly. but, my pump had a malfunction couple weeks ago and i had to get a new one. since then, my glycemic control has been a bit off. 
[doctor] mm-hmm. have you had any severe hypoglycemic events? 
[patient] uh, no, not really. but, i'm having trouble with hyperglycemia, both fasting and postprandial. 
[doctor] got it. are you experiencing any other symptoms like polyuria, polydipsia, or polyphagia? 
[patient] nope, not at all. 
[doctor] okay, gotcha. are you able to exercise regularly? 
[patient] um, no, not really. i have a busy work schedule and a young child to take care of.

"CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Chronic low back, left buttock and leg pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a pleasant 49-year-old gentleman post lumbar disc replacement from January 2005.  Unfortunately, the surgery and interventional procedures have not been helpful in alleviating his pain.  He has also tried acupuncture, TENS unit, physical therapy, chiropractic treatment and multiple neuropathic medications including Elavil, Topamax, Cymbalta, Neurontin, and Lexapro, which he discontinued either due to side effects or lack of effectiveness in decreasing his pain.  Most recently, he has had piriformis injections, which did give him a brief period of relief; however, he reports that the Botox procedure that was done on March 8, 2006 has not given him any relief from his buttock pain.  He states that approximately 75% of his pain is in his buttock and leg and 25% in his back.  He has tried to increase in his activity with walking and does note increased spasm with greater activity in the low back.  He rated his pain today as 6/10, describing it is shooting, sharp and aching.  It is increased with lifting, prolonged standing or walking and squatting, decreased with ice, reclining and pain medication.  It is constant but variable in degree.  It continues to affect activities and sleep at night as well as mood at times.  He is currently not satisfied completely with his level of pain relief.
MEDICATIONS:
Kadian 30 mg b.i.d.
Zanaflex one-half to one tablet p.r.n. spasm, and Advil p.r.n.
ALLERGIES:
No known drug allergies.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Complete multisystem review was noted and signed in the chart.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
Unchanged from prior visit.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Blood pressure 123/87, pulse 89, respirations 18, and weight 220 lbs.  He is a well-developed obese male in no acute distress.  He is alert and oriented x3, and displays normal mood and affect with no evidence of acute anxiety or depression.  He ambulates with normal gait and has normal station.  He is able to heel and toe walk.  He denies any sensory changes.
ASSESSMENT & PLAN:
This is a pleasant 49-year-old with chronic pain plus lumbar disk replacement with radiculitis and myofascial complaints.  We discussed treatment options at length and he is willing to undergo a trial of Lyrica.
He is sensitive to medications based on his past efforts and is given a prescription for 150 mg that he will start at bedtime.  We discussed the up taper schedule and he understands that he will have to be on this for some time before we can decide whether or not it is helpful to him.  We also briefly touched on the possibility of a spinal cord stimulator trial if this medication is not helpful to him.  He will call me if there are any issues with the new prescription and follow in four weeks for reevaluation.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?

"REASON FOR VISIT:
Kyphosis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 13-year-old new patient is here for evaluation of thoracic kyphosis.  The patient has a family history in a maternal aunt and grandfather of kyphosis.  She was noted by her parents to have round back posture.  They have previously seen another orthopedist who recommended observation at this time.  She is here for a second opinion in regards to kyphosis.  The patient denies any pain in her back or any numbness, tingling, or weakness in her upper or lower extremities.  No problems with her bowels or bladder.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
None.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
Bilateral pinning of her ears.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
She is currently an eighth grader at Middle School and is interested in basketball.  She lives with both of her parents and has a 9-year-old brother.  She had menarche beginning in September.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Of kyphosis in great grandmother and second cousin.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
She is in her usual state of health and is negative except otherwise as mentioned in the history of present illness.
MEDICATIONS:
She is currently on Zyrtec, Flonase, and Ceftin for an ear infection.
ALLERGIES:
No known drug allergies.
FINDINGS:
On physical exam, she is alert, oriented, and in no acute distress standing 63 inches tall.  In regards to her back, her skin is intact with no rashes, lesions, and/or no dimpling or hair spots.  No cafe au lait spots.  She is not tender to palpation from her occiput to her sacrum.  There is no evidence of paraspinal muscle spasm.  On forward bending, there is a mild kyphosis.  She is not able to touch her toes indicating her hamstring tightness.  She has a full 5 out of 5 in all muscle groups.  Her lower extremities including iliopsoas, quadriceps, gastroc-soleus, tibialis anterior, and extensor hallucis longus.  Her sensation intact to light touch in L1 through L2 dermatomal distributions.  She has symmetric limb lengths as well bilaterally from both the coronal and sagittal planes.
X-rays today included PA and lateral sclerosis series.  She has approximately 46 degree kyphosis.
ASSESSMENT:
Kyphosis.
PLANS:
The patient's kyphosis is quite mild.  While this is likely in the upper limits of normal or just it is normal for an adolescent and still within normal range as would be expected return at home.  At this time, three options were discussed with the parents including observation, physical therapy, and bracing.  At this juncture, given that she has continued to grow, they are Risser 0.  She may benefit from continued observation with physical therapy, bracing would be a more aggressive option certainly that thing would be lost with following at this time.  As such, she was given a prescription for physical therapy for extension based strengthening exercises, flexibility range of motion exercises, postural training with no forward bending.  We will see her back in 3 months' time for repeat radiographs at that time including PA and lateral standing of scoliosis series.  Should she show evidence of continued progression of her kyphotic deformity, discussions of bracing would be held at time.  We will see her back in 3 months' time for repeat evaluation.","[doctor] hi there, how are you and your parents doing today?
[patient] hi, we're doing okay, thanks.
[doctor] i understand you're here for a second opinion on your thoracic kyphosis, is that right?

"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:
Left hip fracture.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a pleasant 53-year-old female with a known history of sciatica, apparently presented to the emergency room due to severe pain in the left lower extremity and unable to bear weight.  History was obtained from the patient.  As per the history, she reported that she has been having back pain with left leg pain since past 4 weeks.  She has been using a walker for ambulation due to disabling pain in her left thigh and lower back.  She was seen by her primary care physician and was scheduled to go for MRI yesterday.  However, she was walking and her right foot got caught on some type of rug leading to place excessive weight on her left lower extremity to prevent her fall.  Since then, she was unable to ambulate.  The patient called paramedics and was brought to the emergency room.  She denied any history of fall.  She reported that she stepped the wrong way causing the pain to become worse.  She is complaining of severe pain in her lower extremity and back pain.  Denies any tingling or numbness.  Denies any neurological symptoms.  Denies any bowel or bladder incontinence.
X-rays were obtained which were remarkable for left hip fracture.  Orthopedic consultation was called for further evaluation and management.  On further interview with the patient, it is noted that she has a history of malignant melanoma, which was diagnosed approximately 4 to 5 years ago.  She underwent surgery at that time and subsequently, she was noted to have a spread to the lymphatic system and lymph nodes for which she underwent surgery in 3/2008.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Sciatica and melanoma.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
As discussed above, surgery for melanoma and hysterectomy.
ALLERGIES:
NONE.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
Denies any tobacco or alcohol use.  She is divorced with 2 children.  She lives with her son.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL:  The patient is well developed, well nourished in mild distress secondary to left lower extremity and back pain.
MUSCULOSKELETAL:  Examination of the left lower extremity, there is presence of apparent shortening and external rotation deformity.  Tenderness to palpation is present.  Leg rolling is positive for severe pain in the left proximal hip.  Further examination of the spine is incomplete secondary to severe leg pain.  She is unable to perform a straight leg raising.  EHL/EDL 5/5.  2+ pulses are present distally.  Calf is soft and nontender.  Homans sign is negative.  Sensation to light touch is intact.
IMAGING:
AP view of the hip is reviewed.  Only 1 limited view is obtained.  This is a poor quality x-ray with a lot of soft tissue shadow.  This x-ray is significant for basicervical-type femoral neck fracture.  Lesser trochanter is intact.  This is a high intertrochanteric fracture/basicervical.  There is presence of lytic lesion around the femoral neck, which is not well delineated on this particular x-ray.  We need to order repeat x-rays including AP pelvis, femur, and knee.
LABS:
Have been reviewed.
ASSESSMENT:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with probable pathological fracture of the left proximal femur.
DISCUSSION AND PLAN:
Nature and course of the diagnosis has been discussed with the patient.  Based on her presentation without any history of obvious fall or trauma and past history of malignant melanoma, this appears to be a pathological fracture of the left proximal hip.  At the present time, I would recommend obtaining a bone scan and repeat x-rays, which will include AP pelvis, femur, hip including knee.  She denies any pain elsewhere.  She does have a past history of back pain and sciatica, but at the present time, this appears to be a metastatic bone lesion with pathological fracture.  I have discussed the case with Dr. X and recommended oncology consultation.
With the above fracture and presentation, she needs a left hip hemiarthroplasty versus calcar hemiarthroplasty, cemented type.  Indication, risk, and benefits of left hip hemiarthroplasty has been discussed with the patient, which includes, but not limited to bleeding, infection, nerve injury, blood vessel injury, dislocation early and late, persistent pain, leg length discrepancy, myositis ossificans, intraoperative fracture, prosthetic fracture, need for conversion to total hip replacement surgery, revision surgery, DVT, pulmonary embolism, risk of anesthesia, need for blood transfusion, and cardiac arrest.  She understands above and is willing to undergo further procedure.  The goal and the functional outcome have been explained.  Further plan will be discussed with her once we obtain the bone scan and the radiographic studies.  We will also await for the oncology feedback and clearance.
Thank you very much for allowing me to participate in the care of this patient.  I will continue to follow up.","[doctor]: hello, how are you feeling today?
[patient]: hi, i'm in a lot of pain. my left leg is really hurting me.
[doctor]: i understand. so, i reviewed your x-rays and it seems like you have a fracture in your left hip. it's possible that it's a pathological fracture, which means it could be related to your history of melanoma. i would like to order a bone scan and some additional x-rays to get a better picture of what's going on.
[patient]: okay, what does that entail?
[doctor]: the bone scan involves the injection of a small amount of radioactive material into your bloodstream, which will help us to see any areas of increased bone activity. the x-rays will be of your pelvis, femur, and hip including knee. we will also consult with an oncologist to get their input.
[patient]: okay, i understand. what does this mean for me in terms of treatment?
[doctor]: based on the location and extent of the fracture, we will need to perform surgery. we will either do a left hip hemiarthroplasty or a calcar hemiarthroplasty, both of which involve replacing the broken bone with an artificial implant. i want to make you aware of the risks and benefits of these procedures, which include bleeding, infection, nerve injury, dislocation, persistent pain, leg length discrepancy, and more. we will go over these in more detail once we have a better understanding of the extent of the injury.
[patient]: okay, i appreciate you explaining everything to me. what happens next?
[doctor]: we will schedule the bone scan and x-rays, and i will consult with the oncologist. once we have all the information, we will discuss the treatment plan with you in more detail. in the meantime, i will prescribe pain medication to help manage your discomfort. is there anything else you would like to ask or discuss?
[patient]: no, that sounds good. thank you for your help.
[doctor]: of course, i will continue to follow up with you and keep you updated. take care.","[doctor]: hey there, how ya feelin' today?
[patient]: um, hi. i'm really hurting. my left leg is killin' me.
[doctor]: mm-hmm, i see. so, i took a look at your x-rays and it looks like you have a fracture in your left hip. it's possible that it's related to your history of melanoma. i wanna get a better picture of what's goin' on, so i'm gonna order a bone scan and some additional x-rays. 
[patient]: okay, what's that all about?
[doctor]: so, the bone scan involves injecting a small amount of radioactive material into your bloodstream. this will help us see any areas of increased bone activity. the x-rays will be of your pelvis, femur, and hip including knee. we will also consult with an oncologist to get their input.
[patient]: got it. so, what's the treatment plan?
[doctor]: well, based on the location and extent of the fracture, we will need to perform surgery. we will either do a left hip hemiarthroplasty or a calcar hemiarthroplasty. both involve replacing the broken bone with an artificial implant. but before we get to that, we need to understand the extent of the injury first. i wanna make you aware of the risks and benefits of these procedures.

The patient is a 45-year-old African-American female whose symptoms first started some one and a half years ago with pain in the left shoulder and some neck pain.  This has subsequently resolved.  She started vigorous workouts in November 2005.  In March of this year, she suddenly could not feel her right foot on the bathroom floor and subsequently went to her primary care physician.  By her report, she had a nerve conduction study and a diagnosis of radiculopathy was made.  She had an MRI of lumbosacral spine, which was within normal limits.  She then developed a tingling sensation in the right middle toe.  Symptoms progressed to sensory symptoms of her knees, elbows, and left middle toe.  She then started getting sensory sensations in the left hand and arm.  She states that she feels a little bit wobbly at the knees and that she is slightly dragging her left leg.  Symptoms have been mildly progressive.  She is unaware of any trigger other than the vigorous workouts as mentioned above.  She has no associated bowel or bladder symptoms.  No particular position relieves her symptoms.
Workup has included two MRIs of the C-spine, which were personally reviewed and are discussed below.  She saw you for consultation and the possibility of surgical decompression was raised.  At this time, she is somewhat reluctant to go through any surgical procedure.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Ocular migraines.
2.  Myomectomy.
3.  Infertility.
4.  Hyperglycemia.
5.  Asthma.
6.  Hypercholesterolemia.
MEDICATIONS:
Lipitor, Pulmicort, Allegra, Xopenex, Patanol, Duac topical gel, Loprox cream, and Rhinocort.
ALLERGIES:
Penicillin and aspirin.
Family history, social history, and review of systems are discussed above as well as documented in the new patient information sheet.  Of note, she does not drink or smoke.  She is married with two adopted children.  She is a paralegal specialist.  She used to exercise vigorously, but of late has been advised to stop exercising and is currently only walking.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
She does complain of mild blurred vision, but these have occurred before and seem associated with headaches.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
On examination, blood pressure 138/82, pulse 90, respiratory rate 14, and weight 176.5 pounds.  Pain scale is 0.  A full general and neurological examination was personally performed and is documented on the chart.  Of note, she has a normal general examination.  Neurological examination reveals normal cognition and cranial nerve examination including normal jaw jerk.  She has mild postural tremor in both arms.  She has mild decreased sensation in the right palm and mild decreased light touch in the right palm and decreased vibration sense in both distal lower extremities.  Motor examination reveals no weakness to individual muscle testing, but on gait she does have a very subtle left hemiparesis.  She has hyperreflexia in her lower extremities, worse on the left.  Babinski's are downgoing.
PERTINENT DATA:
MRI of the brain from 05/02/06 and MRI of the C-spine from 05/02/06 and 07/25/06 were personally reviewed.  MRI of the brain is broadly within normal limits.  MRI of the C-spine reveals large central disc herniation at C6-C7 with evidence of mild cord compression and abnormal signal in the cord suggesting cord edema.  There is also a fairly large disc at C3-C4 with cord deformity and partial effacement of the subarachnoid space.  I do not appreciate any cord edema at this level.
IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with cervical spondylosis with a large C6-C7 herniated disc with mild cord compression and signal change at that level.  She has a small disc at C3-C4 with less severe and only subtle cord compression.  History and examination are consistent with signs of a myelopathy.
Results were discussed with the patient and her mother.  I am concerned about progressive symptoms.  Although she only has subtle symptoms now, we made her aware that with progression of this process, she may have paralysis.  If she is involved in any type of trauma to the neck such as motor vehicle accident, she could have an acute paralysis.  I strongly recommended to her and her mother that she followup with you as soon as possible for surgical evaluation.  I agree with the previous physicians who have told her not to exercise as I am sure that her vigorous workouts and weight training since November 2005 have contributed to this problem.  I have recommended that she wear a hard collar while driving.  The results of my consultation were discussed with you telephonically.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i am doing okay, thank you for asking.
[doctor] i am dr. x, and i will be discussing your medical history, current condition and treatment plan. you were referred to me for cervical spondylosis, and i have personally reviewed your medical records and mri scans. based on my examination and review, it seems that you have a large herniated disc at c6-c7 and mild cord compression, and a smaller disc at c3-c4. this is causing the tingling sensation and some loss of sensation in your limbs that you have been experiencing.
[patient] yes, that is correct.
[doctor] i want to emphasize that this condition could lead to progressive symptoms, and if there is trauma to your neck, it could cause more severe paralysis. i strongly recommend that you follow up with me for surgical evaluation as soon as possible.
[patient] i am a bit reluctant to undergo surgery. is there any other treatment option available?
[doctor] i understand your concerns, but surgery is the best option for this condition. by wearing a hard collar while driving and avoiding vigorous workouts, you might manage your symptoms to some extent, but this will not cure the underlying condition. please do not worry, we will provide you with all the necessary information and support to make an informed decision about your treatment.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?

"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient comes in today because of feeling lightheaded and difficulty keeping his balance.  He denies this as a spinning sensation that he had had in the past with vertigo.  He just describes as feeling very lightheaded.  It usually occurs with position changes such as when he stands up from the sitting position or stands up from a lying position.  It tends to ease when he sits down again, but does not totally resolve for another 15 to 30 minutes and he feels shaky and weak all over.  Lorazepam did not help this sensation.  His blood pressure has been up lately and his dose of metoprolol was increased.  They feel these symptoms have gotten worse since metoprolol was increased.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Detailed on our H&P form.  Positive for elevated cholesterol, diabetes, glaucoma, cataracts, hypertension, heart disease, vertigo, stroke in May of 2005, congestive heart failure, CABG, and cataract removed right eye.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
Detailed on the H&P form.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
His blood pressure sitting down was 180/80 with a pulse rate of 56.  Standing up blood pressure was 160/80 with a pulse rate of 56.  His general exam and neurological exam were detailed on our H&P form.  Pertinent positives on his neurological exam were decreased sensation in his left face, and left arm and leg.
IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
This lightheaded, he exquisitely denies vertigo, the vertigo that he has had in the past.  He states this is more of a lightheaded type feeling.  He did have a mild blood pressure drop here in the office.  We are also concerned that bradycardia might be contributing to his feeling of lightheadedness.  We are going to suggest that he gets a Holter monitor and he should speak to his general practitioner as well as his cardiologist regarding the lightheaded feeling.
We will schedule him for the Holter monitor and refer him back to his cardiologist.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] not too good, i’ve been feeling lightheaded and having difficulty keeping my balance.
[doctor] okay, can you tell me more about it? is it the same sensation as the vertigo you've had in the past?
[patient] no, this feels different. it’s just a general feeling of lightheadedness. it usually happens when i stand up from sitting or lying down and takes about 15-30 minutes to ease off. i also feel weak and shaky during this time.
[doctor] i see. have you experienced this before?
[patient] no, this is new.
[doctor] i understand. i see here that your blood pressure has been up lately, and your dose of metoprolol was increased. do you think this could be contributing to your symptoms?
[patient] yes, i think it has gotten worse since my medication was increased.
[doctor] i see. your blood pressure is still high, and i'm also concerned that bradycardia might be contributing to your lightheadedness. we need to rule out any underlying heart conditions. we will suggest getting a holter monitor and refer you back to your cardiologist to further evaluate the lightheaded feeling. 
[patient] okay, i'll do that. thank you.
[doctor] you're welcome. let's get you scheduled for the holter monitor and make an appointment to see your cardiologist.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?

"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 74-year-old white woman who has a past medical history of hypertension for 15 years, history of CVA with no residual hemiparesis and uterine cancer with pulmonary metastases, who presented for evaluation of recent worsening of the hypertension.  According to the patient, she had stable blood pressure for the past 12-15 years on 10 mg of lisinopril.  In August of 2007, she was treated with doxorubicin and, as well as Procrit and her blood pressure started to go up to over 200s.  Her lisinopril was increased to 40 mg daily.  She was also given metoprolol and HCTZ two weeks ago, after she visited the emergency room with increased systolic blood pressure.  Denies any physical complaints at the present time.  Denies having any renal problems in the past.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
As above plus history of anemia treated with Procrit.  No smoking or alcohol use and lives alone.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Unremarkable.
PRESENT MEDICATIONS:
As above.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Cardiovascular:  No chest pain.  No palpitations.  Pulmonary:  No shortness of breath, cough, or wheezing.  Gastrointestinal:  No nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.  GU:  No nocturia.  Denies having gross hematuria.  Salt intake is minimal.  Neurological:  Unremarkable, except for history of old CVA.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Blood pressure today is 182/78.  Examination of the head is unremarkable.  Neck is supple with no JVD.  Lungs are clear.  There is no abdominal bruit.  Extremities 1+ edema bilaterally.
LABORATORY DATA:
Urinalysis done in the office shows 1+ proteinuria; same is shown by urinalysis done at Hospital.  The creatinine is 0.8.  Renal ultrasound showed possible renal artery stenosis and a 2 cm cyst in the left kidney.  MRA of the renal arteries was essentially unremarkable with no suspicion for renal artery stenosis.
IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
Accelerated hypertension.  No clear-cut etiology for recent worsening since renal artery stenosis was ruled out by negative MRA.  I could only blame Procrit initiation, as well as possible fluid retention as a cause of the patient's accelerated hypertension.  She was started on hydrochlorothiazide less than two weeks ago with some improvement in her hypertension.  At this point, I would not pursue a diagnosis of renal artery stenosis.  Since she is maxed out on lisinopril and her pulse is 60, I would not increase beta-blocker or ACE inhibitor.  I will continue HCTZ at 24 mg daily.  The patient was also given a sample of Tekturna, which would hopefully improve her systolic blood pressure.  The patient was told to be stick with her salt intake.  She will report to me in 10 days with the result of her blood pressure.  She will also repeat an SMA7 to rule out possible hyperkalemia due to Tekturna.","[doctor] hi there! how are you feeling today?
[patient] hello doctor. i am doing fine.
[doctor] good to know that. so, i see that you have a long history of hypertension. can you tell me about your recent blood pressure readings?
[patient] yes, my blood pressure has worsened lately despite being stable for the past 12-15 years on 10 mg of lisinopril. in august of 2007, my blood pressure started to go up to over 200s and my lisinopril was increased to 40 mg daily.
[doctor] i see. and have you experienced any physical complaints or discomfort recently?
[patient] no, i haven't felt any discomfort as of now.

"HISTORY:
A is a 55-year-old who I know well because I have been taking care of her husband.  She comes for discussion of a screening colonoscopy.  Her last colonoscopy was in 2002, and at that time she was told it was essentially normal.  Nonetheless, she has a strong family history of colon cancer, and it has been almost four to five years so she wants to have a repeat colonoscopy.  I told her that the interval was appropriate and that it made sense to do so.  She denies any significant weight change that she cannot explain.  She has had no hematochezia.  She denies any melena.  She says she has had no real change in her bowel habit but occasionally does have thin stools.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
On today's visit we reviewed her entire health history.  Surgically she has had a stomach operation for ulcer disease back in 1974, she says.  She does not know exactly what was done.  It was done at a hospital in California which she says no longer exists.  This makes it difficult to find out exactly what she had done.  She also had her gallbladder and appendix taken out in the 1970s at the same hospital.  Medically she has no significant problems and no true medical illnesses.  She does suffer from some mild gastroparesis, she says.
MEDICATIONS:
Reglan 10 mg once a day.
ALLERGIES:
She denies any allergies to medications but is sensitive to medications that cause her to have ulcers, she says.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
She still smokes one pack of cigarettes a day.  She was counseled to quit.  She occasionally uses alcohol.  She has never used illicit drugs.  She is married, is a housewife, and has four children.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Positive for diabetes and cancer.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Essentially as mentioned above.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL:  A is a healthy appearing female in no apparent distress.
VITAL SIGNS:  Her vital signs reveal a weight of 164 pounds, blood pressure 140/90, temperature of 97.6 degrees F.
HEENT:  No cervical bruits, thyromegaly, or masses.  She has no lymphadenopathy in the head and neck, supraclavicular, or axillary spaces bilaterally.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes, rubs, or rhonchi.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur, rub, or gallop.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.
EXTREMITIES:  No cyanosis, clubbing, or edema, with good pulses in the radial arteries bilaterally.
NEURO:  No focal deficits, is intact to soft touch in all four.
ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS:
In light of her history and physical, clearly the patient would be well served with an upper and lower endoscopy.  We do not know what the anatomy is, and if she did have an antrectomy, she needs to be checked for marginal ulcers.  She also complains of significant reflux and has not had an upper endoscopy in over five to six years as well.  I discussed the risks, benefits, and alternatives to upper and lower endoscopy, and these include over sedation, perforation, and dehydration, and she wants to proceed.
We will schedule her for an upper and lower endoscopy at her convenience.","[doctor] hi, a. how are you doing today?

"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:
Breast reconstruction post mastectomy.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 51-year-old lady, who had gone many years without a mammogram when she discovered a lump in her right breast early in February of this year.  She brought this to the attention of her primary care doctor and she soon underwent ultrasound and mammogram followed by needle biopsy, which revealed that there was breast cancer.  This apparently was positive in two separate locations within the suspicious area.  She also underwent MRI, which suggested that there was significant size to the area involved.  Her contralateral left breast appeared to be uninvolved.  She has had consultation with Dr. ABC and they are currently in place to perform a right mastectomy.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Positive for hypertension, which is controlled on medications.  She is a nonsmoker and engages in alcohol only moderately.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
Surgical history includes uterine fibroids, some kind of cyst excision on her foot, and cataract surgery.
ALLERGIES:
None known.
MEDICATIONS:
Lipitor, ramipril, Lasix, and potassium.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
On examination, the patient is a healthy looking 51-year-old lady, who is moderately overweight.  Breast exam reveals significant breast hypertrophy bilaterally with a double D breast size and significant shoulder grooving from her bra straps.  There are no any significant scars on the right breast as she has only undergone needle biopsy at this point.  Exam also reveals abdomen where there is moderate excessive fat, but what I consider a good morphology for a potential TRAM flap.
IMPRESSION:
A 51-year-old lady for mastectomy on the right side, who is interested in the possibility of breast reconstruction.  We discussed the breast reconstruction options in some detail including immediate versus delayed reconstruction and autologous tissue versus implant reconstruction.  I think for a lady of this physical size and breast morphology that the likelihood of getting a good result with a tissue expander reconstruction is rather slim.  A further complicating factor is the fact that she may well be undergoing radiation after her mastectomy.  I would think this would make a simple tissue expander reconstruction virtually beyond the balance of consideration.  I have occasionally gotten away with tissue expanders with reasonable results in irradiated patients when they are thinner and smaller breasted, but in a heavier lady with large breasts, I think it virtually deemed to failure.  We therefore, mostly confine our discussion to the relative merits of TRAM flap breast reconstruction and latissimus dorsi reconstruction with implant.  In either case, the contralateral breast reduction would be part of the overall plan.

The patient understands that the TRAM flap although not much more lengthy of a procedure is a little comfortable recovery.  Since we are sacrificing a rectus abdominus muscle that can be more discomfort and difficulties in healing both due to it being a respiratory muscle and to its importance in sitting up and getting out of bed.  In any case, she does prefer this option in order to avoid the need for an implant.  We discussed pros and cons of the surgery, including the risks such as infection, bleeding, scarring, hernia, or bulging of the donor site, seroma of the abdomen, and fat necrosis or even the skin slough in the abdomen.  We also discussed some of the potential flap complications including partial or complete necrosis of the TRAM flap itself.
PLAN:
The patient is definitely interested in undergoing TRAM flap reconstruction.  At the moment, we are planning to do it as an immediate reconstruction at the time of the mastectomy.  For this reason, I have made arrangements to do initial vascular delay procedure within the next couple of days.  We may cancel this if the chance of postoperative irradiation is high.  If this is the case, I think we can do a better job on the reconstruction if we defer it.  The patient understands this and will proceed according to the recommendations from Dr. ABC and from the oncologist.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, i'm feeling good, thank you.
[doctor] that's great to hear. i understand that you are interested in breast reconstruction post mastectomy?
[patient] yes, that's correct.
[doctor] okay, let's talk about your options for reconstruction. we can either do an autologous tissue reconstruction, such as a tram flap, or an implant reconstruction. based on your physical size and breast morphology, i would recommend a tram flap reconstruction for a better result. however, i must warn you that there are some risks associated with this procedure, such as infection, bleeding, scarring, hernia, or bulging of the donor site, seroma of the abdomen, and fat necrosis or even the skin slough in the abdomen. are you aware of these risks?
[patient] yes, i understand the risks and i still prefer the tram flap reconstruction.
[doctor] okay, that's good to know. we will plan to do it as an immediate reconstruction at the time of your mastectomy. however, if the chance of postoperative irradiation is high, we may need to defer the reconstruction. i will coordinate with dr. abc and your oncologist to ensure that we make the best decision for your case. in the meantime, we will do an initial vascular delay procedure within the next couple of days to prepare for the reconstruction. do you have any questions or concerns?
[patient] no, i don't have any questions or concerns at the moment. thank you for explaining everything to me.
[doctor] you're welcome. if you have any further questions, don't hesitate to ask.","[doctor] hey, how's it going? feeling good today?
[patient] um, yeah, i'm doing alright. thanks for asking.
[doctor] awesome. so, i heard you're interested in breast reconstruction after your mastectomy. is that right?
[patient] yeah, that's correct.
[doctor] alrighty, let's chat options. we could go for an autologous tissue reconstruction like a tram flap, or an implant reconstruction. based on your size and breast shape, i'm thinking a tram flap would be the better choice for you. however, i gotta give you the heads up that there are some risks involved, like infection, bleeding, scarring, hernia, or bulging of the donor site, seroma of the abdomen, and fat necrosis or even the skin slough in the abdomen. have you heard about these?
[patient] mm-hmm, yeah, i know about the risks. but i still think the tram flap is the way to go for me.
[doctor] alrighty, sounds good. we'll plan for an immediate reconstruction after your mastectomy. but if we think there might be a high chance of postoperative irradiation, we might have to hold off on the reconstruction. i'll chat with dr. abc and your oncologist to make the best call for your case. in the meantime, we'll get you set up with an initial vascular delay procedure in the next couple of days to prep for the reconstruction. any questions or concerns for me?
[patient] nope, i think i'm good for now. thanks for explaining everything to me.
[doctor] no problemo. just holler if you need anything else, okay?",11
"PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Her medical conditions driving her toward surgery include hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, varicose veins, prior history of stroke.  She denies any history of cancer.  She does have a history of hepatitis which I will need to further investigate.  She complains of multiple joint pains, and heavy snoring.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
Includes hysterectomy in 1995 for fibroids and varicose vein removal.  She had one ovary removed at the time of the hysterectomy as well.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
She is a single mother of one adopted child.
FAMILY HISTORY:
There is a strong family history of heart disease and hypertension, as well as diabetes on both sides of her family.  Her mother is alive.  Her father is deceased from alcohol.  She has five siblings.
MEDICATIONS:
As you know she takes the following medications for her diabetes, insulin 70 units/6 units times four years, aspirin 81 mg a day, Actos 15 mg, Crestor 10 mg and CellCept 500 mg two times a day.
ALLERGIES:
She has no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAM:
She is a 54-year-old obese female.  She does not appear to have any significant residual deficits from her stroke.  There may be slight left arm weakness.
ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
We will have her undergo routine nutritional and psychosocial assessment.  I suspect that we can significantly improve the situation with her insulin and oral hypoglycemia, as well as hypertension, with significant weight loss.  She is otherwise at increased risk for future complications given her history, and weight loss will be a good option.  We will see her back in the office once she completes her preliminary workup and submit her for approval to the insurance company.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?

This is a 7-year-old white male who has no history of systemic disease, who until 2 months ago, was doing well and 2 months ago, he started to complain of pain in his fingers, elbows, and neck.  At this moment, this is better and is almost gone, but for several months, he was having pain to the point that he would cry at some point.  He is not a complainer according to his mom and he is a very active kid.  There is no history of previous illness to this or had gastrointestinal problems.  He has problems with allergies, especially seasonal allergies and he takes Claritin for it.  Other than that, he has not had any other problem.

"XYZ, D.C.
Re:  ABC,Dear Dr. XYZ:
I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, ABC, today MM/DD/YYYY in consultation.  He is an unfortunate 19-year-old right-handed male who was injured in a motor vehicle accident on MM/DD/YYYY, where he was the driver of an automobile, which was struck on the front passenger's side.  The patient sustained impact injuries to his neck and lower back.  There was no apparent head injury or loss of consciousness and he denied any posttraumatic seizures.  He was taken to Hospital, x-rays were taken, apparently which were negative and he was released.
At the present time, he complains of neck and lower back pain radiating into his right arm and right leg with weakness, numbness, paraesthesia, and tingling in his right arm and right leg.  He has had no difficulty with bowel or bladder function.  He does experience intermittent headaches associated with his neck pain with no other associated symptoms.
PAST HEALTH:
He was injured in a prior motor vehicle accident on MM/DD/YYYY.  At the time of his most recent injuries, he was completely symptom free and under no active therapy.  There is no history of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, neurological disorders, ulcers or tuberculosis.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
He denies tobacco or alcohol consumption.
ALLERGIES:
No known drug allergies.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
None.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Otherwise noncontributory.
FUNCTIONAL INQUIRY:
Otherwise noncontributory.
REVIEW OF DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:
Includes an MRI scan of the cervical spine dated MM/DD/YYYY which showed evidence for disc bulging at the C6-C7 level.  MRI scan of the lumbar spine on MM/DD/YYYY, showed evidence of a disc herniation at the L1-L2 level as well as a disc protrusion at the L2-L3 level with disc herniations at the L3-L4 and L4-L5 level and disc protrusion at the L5-S1 level.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Reveals an alert and oriented male with normal language function.  Vital Signs:  Blood pressure was 105/68 in the left arm sitting.  Heart rate was 70 and regular.  Height was 5 feet 8 inches.  Weight was 182 pounds.  Cranial nerve evaluation was unremarkable.  Pupils were equal and reactive.  Funduscopic evaluation was clear.  There was no evidence for nystagmus.  There was decreased range of motion noted in both the cervical and lumbar regions to a significant degree, with tenderness and spasm in the paraspinal musculature.  Straight leg raising was limited to 45 degrees on the right and 90 degrees on the left.  Motor strength was 5/5 on the MRC scale.  Reflexes were 2+ symmetrical and active.  No pathological responses were noted.  Sensory examination showed a diffuse decreased sensation to pinprick in the right upper extremity.  Cerebellar function was normal.  There was normal station and gait.  Chest and cardiovascular evaluations were unremarkable.  Heart sounds were normal.  There were no extra sounds or murmurs.  Palpable trigger points were noted in the right trapezius and right cervical and lumbar paraspinal musculature.
CLINICAL IMPRESSION:
Reveals a 19-year-old male suffering from a posttraumatic cervical and lumbar radiculopathy, secondary to traumatic injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident on MM/DD/YYYY.  In view of the persistent radicular complaints associated with the weakness, numbness, paraesthesia, and tingling as well as the objective sensory loss noted on today's evaluation as well as the non-specific nature of the radiculopathy, I have scheduled him for an EMG study on his right upper and right lower extremity in two week's time to rule out any nerve root irritation versus any peripheral nerve entrapment or plexopathy as the cause of his symptoms.  Palpable trigger points were noted on today's evaluation.  He is suffering from ongoing myofascitis.  His treatment plan will consist of a series of trigger point injections to be initiated at his next follow up visit in two weeks' time.  I have encouraged him to continue with his ongoing treatment program under your care and supervision.  I will be following him in two weeks' time.  Once again, thank you kindly for allowing me to participate in this patient's care and management.
Yours sincerely,,","[doctor] hi abc, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi doctor, i'm not doing too well. i'm having neck and lower back pain with weakness, numbness, paraesthesia, and tingling in my right arm and right leg.
[doctor] i see, i reviewed the report from the doctor you saw earlier who referred you to me. it says here that you were in a motor vehicle accident on mm/dd/yyyy, where you were the driver of an automobile that was struck on the front passenger's side. is that correct?
[patient] yes, that's right.
[doctor] do you remember if you hit your head during the accident or if you lost consciousness?
[patient] no, i didn't hit my head, and i didn't lose consciousness.
[doctor] okay, that's good to know. i see that you went to the hospital and had x-rays taken, which were negative, and then you were released. do you have any difficulty with bowel or bladder function?
[patient] no, i don't.
[doctor] that's good. i also see that you had an mri scan of your cervical and lumbar spine, which showed evidence of disc bulging and herniation. i would like to perform an emg study on your right upper and right lower extremity in two weeks' time to rule out any nerve root irritation versus any peripheral nerve entrapment or plexopathy as the cause of your symptoms. additionally, i noticed some trigger points in your right trapezius and right cervical and lumbar paraspinal musculature, which suggest myofascitis. therefore, we will start a series of trigger point injections at your next follow-up visit in two weeks. in the meantime, i encourage you to continue your ongoing treatment program under your regular doctor's care and supervision. is there anything else that you would like to discuss with me?
[patient] no, i think that's all. thank you, doctor.
[doctor] you're welcome. i look forward to seeing you in two weeks.","[doctor] hey there abc, how are you feeling today?

"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 57-year-old female being seen today for evaluation of pain and symptoms related to a recurrent bunion deformity in bilateral feet, right greater than left.  The patient states she is having increasing symptoms of pain and discomfort associated with recurrence of bunion deformity on the right foot and pain localized to the second toe and MTP joint of the right foot as well.  The patient had prior surgery performed approximately 13 years ago.  She states that since the time of the original surgery the deformity has slowly recurred, and she has noticed progressive deformity in the lesser toes at the second and third toes of the left foot and involving the second toe of the right foot.  The patient is employed on her feet as a hospital employee and states that she does wear a functional orthotic which does provide some relief of forefoot pain although not complete.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, SOCIAL HISTORY & REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
See Patient History sheet, which was reviewed with the patient and is signed in the chart.  Past medical history on the patient, past surgical history, current medications, drug-related allergies and social history have all been updated and reviewed, and enclosed in the chart.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Physical exam reveals a pleasant, 57-year-old female who is 5 feet 4 inches and 150 pounds.  She has palpable pulses.  Neurologic sensation is intact.  Examination of the extremities shows the patient as having well-healed surgical sites from her arthroplasty, second digits bilaterally and prior bunionectomy.  There is a recurrence of bunion deformity noted on both great toes although the patient notes to have reasonably good range of movement.  She has particular pain in the second MTP joint of the right foot and demonstrates a mild claw-toe deformity of the second and third toes to the left foot, and to a lesser degree the second toe to the right.  Gait analysis:  The patient stands and walks with a rather severe pes planus and has generalized hypermobility noted in the feet.
X-RAY INTERPRETATION:
X-rays taken today; three views to the right foot shows presence of internal K-wire and wire from prior bunionectomy.  Biomechanical analysis shows 15 degree intermetatarsal angle and approximately 45 degree hallux abducto valgus angle.  No evidence of arthrosis in the joint is noted.  Significant shift to the fibular sesamoid is present.
ASSESSMENT:
1.  Recurrent bunion deformity, right forefoot.
2.  Pes planovalgus deformity, bilateral feet.
PLAN/TREATMENT:
1.  Today, we did review remaining treatment options with the patient including the feasibility of conservative versus surgical treatment.  The patient would require an open wedge osteotomy to reduce the intermetatarsal angle with the lateral release and a decompression osteotomy  at the second metatarsal.  Anticipated length of healing was noted for the patient as were potential risks and complications.  The patient ultimately would probably require surgery on her left foot at a later date as well.
2.  The patient will explore her ability to get out of work for the above-mentioned period of time and will be in touch with regards regarding scheduling at a later date.
3.  All questions were answered.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hello, i'm good, thank you.
[doctor] so, i see here that you're having pain and discomfort associated with a recurrent bunion deformity on your right foot and pain localized to the second toe and mtp joint of the right foot as well. how long have you been experiencing these symptoms?
[patient] it's been slowly recurring since my original surgery that was done around 13 years ago.
[doctor] okay, i see. and you've also noticed progressive deformity in the lesser toes of both feet. is that correct?

"CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Right shoulder pain.
HISTORY:
The patient is a pleasant, 31-year-old, right-handed, white female who injured her shoulder while transferring a patient back on 01/01/02.  She formerly worked for Veteran's Home as a CNA.  She has had a long drawn out course of treatment for this shoulder.  She tried physical therapy without benefit and ultimately came to a subacromion decompression in November 2002.  She had ongoing pain and was evaluated by Dr. X who felt that she had a possible brachial plexopathy.  He also felt she had a right superficial radial neuritis and blocked this with resolution of her symptoms.  He then referred her to ABCD who did EMG testing, demonstrating a right suprascapular neuropathy although a C5 radiculopathy could not be ruled out.  MRI testing on the cervical spine was then done which was negative for disk herniation and she underwent suprascapular nerve decompression of the scapular notch on 12/18/03.  She finally went to an anterior axillary nerve block because of ongoing pain in the anterior shoulder again by Dr. X.  She comes to me for impairment rating.  She has no chronic health problems otherwise, fevers, chills, or general malaise.  She is not working.  She is right-hand dominant.  She denies any prior history of injury to her shoulder.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Negative aside from above.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Noncontributory.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
Please see above.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Negative aside from above.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
A pleasant, age appropriate woman, moderately overweight, in no apparent distress.  Normal gait and station, normal posture, normal strength, tone, sensation and deep tendon reflexes with the exception of 4+/5 strength in the supraspinatus musculature on the right.  She has decreased motion in the right shoulder as follows.  She has 160 degrees of flexion, 155 degrees of abduction, 35 degrees of extension, 25 degrees of adduction, 45 degrees of internal rotation and 90 degrees of external rotation.  She has a positive impingement sign on the right.
ASSESSMENT:
Right shoulder impingement syndrome, right suprascapular neuropathy.
DISCUSSION:
With a reasonable degree of medical certainty, she is at maximum medical improvement and she does have an impairment based on AMA Guide to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fifth Edition.  The reason for this impairment is the incident of 01/01/02.  For her suprascapular neuropathy, she is rated as a grade IV motor deficit which I rate as a 13% motor deficit.  This is multiplied by a maximum upper extremity impairment for involvement of the suprascapular nerve of 16% which produces a 2% impairment of the upper extremity when the two values are multiplied together, 2% impairment of the upper extremity.  For her lack of motion in the shoulder she also has additional impairment on the right.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder flexion.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder abduction.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder adduction.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder extension.  There is no impairment for findings in shoulder external rotation.  She has a 3% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder internal rotation.  Thus the impairment due to lack of motion in her shoulder is a 6% impairment of the upper extremity.  This combines with the 2% impairment of the upper extremity due to weakness in the suprascapular nerve root distribution to produce an 8% impairment of the upper extremity which in turn is a 5% impairment of the whole person based on the AMA Guide to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fifth Edition, stated with a reasonable degree of medical certainty.","[doctor] hi, can you tell me a bit about your shoulder pain?
[patient] hi, i injured my shoulder while transferring a patient back in 2002. i've had a long course of treatment including physical therapy and surgery, but the pain persists.
[doctor] i see. have you had any other health problems or injuries in the past?
[patient] no, aside from this shoulder pain, i haven't had any chronic health problems or injuries.
[doctor] alright. during the physical examination, i noticed some decreased motion in your right shoulder and a positive impingement sign. based on your history and examination, i believe you have right shoulder impingement syndrome and right suprascapular neuropathy. 
[patient] okay.
[doctor] i would recommend an impairment rating based on ama guide to the evaluation of permanent impairment, fifth edition. with a reasonable degree of medical certainty, you have a 5% whole person impairment due to the lack of motion in your shoulder and weakness in the suprascapular nerve root distribution.
[patient] okay, thank you. what are my treatment options?
[doctor] at this point, i recommend further physical therapy and possibly a corticosteroid injection to help manage the pain. it's important to keep the shoulder moving to prevent further stiffness.","[doctor] hi, can you tell me a bit about your shoulder pain?

"The patient states that she has been doing fairly well at home.  She balances her own checkbook.  She does not do her own taxes, but she has never done so in the past.  She states that she has no problems with cooking meals, getting her own meals, and she is still currently driving.  She denies burning any dishes because she forgot them on the stove or forgetting what she is doing in the middle of a task or getting lost while she is driving around or getting lost in her own home.  She states that she is very good remembering the names of her family members and does not forget important birthdays such as the date of birth of her grandchildren.  She is unfortunately living alone, and although she seems to miss her grandchildren and is estranged from her son, she denies any symptoms of frank depression.  There is unfortunately no one available to us to corroborate how well she is doing at home.  She lives alone and takes care of herself and does not communicate very much with her brother and sister.  She also does not communicate very much with her son who lives in Santa Cruz or her grandchildren.  She denied any sort of personality change, paranoid ideas or hallucinations.  She does appear to have headaches that can be severe about four times a month and have primarily photophobia and some nausea and occasionally emesis associated with it.  When these headaches are very severe, she goes to the emergency room to get a single shot.  She is unclear if this is some sort of a migraine medication or just a primary pain medication.  She takes Fiorinal for these headaches and she states that this helps greatly.  She denies visual or migraine symptoms.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Negative for any sort of focal neurologic deficits such as weakness, numbness, visual changes, dysarthria, diplopia or dysphagia.  She also denies any sort of movement disorders, tremors, rigidities or clonus.  Her personal opinion is that some of her memory problems may be due to simply to her age and/or nervousness.  She is unclear as if her memory is any worse than anyone else in her age group.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Significant for mesothelioma, which was diagnosed seemingly more than 20 to 25 years ago.  The patient was not sure of exactly when it was diagnosed.  This has been treated surgically by debulking operations for which she states that she has undergone about 10 operations.  The mesothelioma is in her abdomen.  She does not know of any history of having lung mesothelioma.  She states that she has never gotten chemotherapy or radiation for her mesothelioma.  Furthermore, she states that her last surgical debulking was more than 10 years ago and her disease has been fairly stable.  She does have a history of three car accidents that she says were all rear-enders where she was hit while essentially in a stopped position.  These have all occurred over the past five years.  She also has a diagnosis of dementing illness, possibly Alzheimer disease from her previous neurology consultation.  This diagnosis was given in March 2006.
MEDICATIONS:
Fiorinal, p.r.n. aspirin, unclear if baby or full sized, Premarin unclear of the dose.
ALLERGIES:
NONE.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
Significant for her being without a companion at this point.  She was born in Munich, Germany.  She immigrated to of America in 1957 after her family had to move to Eastern Germany, which was under Russian occupation at that time.  She is divorced.  She used to work as a secretary and later worked as a clerical worker at IBM.  She stopped working more than 20 years ago due to complications from her mesothelioma.  She denies any significant tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs.  She is bilingual speaking, German and English.  She has known English from before her teens.  She has the equivalent of a high school education in Germany.  She has one brother and one sister, both of whom are healthy and she does not spend much time communicating with them.  She has one son who lives in Santa Cruz.  He has grandchildren.  She is trying to contact with her grandchildren.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Significant for lung, liver, and prostate cancer.  Her mother died in her 80s of ""old age,"" but it appears that she may have had a mild dementing illness at that time.  Whatever that dementing illness was, appears to have started mostly in her 80s per the patient.  No one else appears to have Alzheimer disease including her brother and sister.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Her blood pressure is 152/92, pulse 80, and weight 80.7 kg.  She is alert and well nourished in no apparent distress.  She occasionally fumbles with questions of orientation, missing the day and the date.  She also did not know the name of the hospital, she thought it was O'Connor and she thought she was in Orange County and also did not know the floor of the hospital that we are in.  She lost three points for recall.  Even with prompting, she could not remember the objects that she was given to remember.  Her Mini Mental Score was 22/30.  There were no naming problems or problems with repetition.  There were also no signs of dysarthria.  Her pupils were bilaterally reactive to light and accommodation.  Her extraocular movements were intact.  Her visual fields were full to confrontation.  Her sensations of her face, arm, and leg were normal.  There were no signs of neglect with double simultaneous stimulation.  Tongue was midline.  Her palate was symmetric.  Her face was symmetric as well.  Strength was approximately 5/5.  She did have some right knee pain and she had a mildly antalgic gait due to her right knee pain.  Her reflexes were symmetric and +2 except for her toes, which were +1 to trace.  Her plantar reflexes were mute.  Her sensation was normal for pain, temperature, and vibration.  There were no signs of ataxia on finger-to-nose and there was no dysdiadochokinesia.  Gait was narrow and she could toe walk briefly and heel walk without difficulty.
SUMMARY:
Ms. A is a pleasant 72-year-old right-handed woman with a history of mesothelioma that appears stable at this time and likely mild dementia, most likely Alzheimer type.  We tactfully discussed the patient's diagnosis with her, and she felt reassured.  We told her that this most likely was in the earlier stages of disease and she would benefit from trying Aricept.  She stated that she did not have the prescription anymore from her outpatient neurology consult for the Aricept, so we wrote her another prescription for Aricept.  The patient herself seemed very concerned about the stigma of the disease, but our lengthy discussion, expressed genuine understanding as to why her outpatient physician had reported her to DMV.  It was explicitly told to not drive by her outpatient neurologist and we concur with this assessment.  She will follow up with us in the next six months and will call us if she has any problems with the Aricept.  She was written for Aricept to start at 5 mg for three weeks, and if she has no side effects which typically are GI side effects, then she can go up to 10 mg a day.  We also reviewed with Ms. A the findings for outpatient MRI, which showed some mild atrophy per report and also that her metabolic workup, which included an RPR, TSH, and B12 were all within normal limits.

[doctor] that's good to hear. as you know, you have had a cerebrovascular accident involving the right upper pons extending into the right cerebral peduncle. i recommend that you continue with antiplatelet and statin therapy to reduce the risk of future strokes. you should also continue to follow up with endocrinology for your diabetes and thyroid problems. i suggest strict control of your blood sugar, optimizing cholesterol and blood pressure control, regular exercise, and a healthy diet. finally, i would like you to contact us for post-surgical recovery after your internal carotid artery surgery. do you have any questions for me?
[patient] no, i think i understand everything.
[doctor] alright, i will see you back in four months or sooner if needed. take care of yourself.",10
"CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Newly diagnosed T-cell lymphoma.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a very pleasant 40-year-old gentleman who reports swelling in his left submandibular region that occurred all of a sudden about a month and a half ago.

"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:
I was asked by Dr. X to see the patient in regard to his likely recurrent brain tumor.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient was admitted for symptoms that sounded like postictal state.  He was initially taken to Hospital.  CT showed edema and slight midline shift, and therefore he was transferred here.  He has been seen by Hospitalists Service.  He has not had a recurrent seizure.  Electroencephalogram shows slowing.  MRI of the brain shows large inhomogeneous infiltrating right frontotemporal neoplasm surrounding the right middle cerebral artery.  There is inhomogeneous uptake consistent with potential necrosis.  He also has had a SPECT image of his brain, consistent with neoplasm, suggesting relatively high-grade neoplasm.  The patient was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 1999.  All details are still not available to us.  He underwent a biopsy by Dr. Y. One of the notes suggested that this was a glioma, likely an oligodendroglioma, pending a second opinion at Clinic.  That is not available on the chart as I dictate.
After discussion of treatment issues with radiation therapist and Dr. Z (medical oncologist), the decision was made to treat him primarily with radiation alone.  He tolerated that reasonably well.  His wife says it's been several years since he had a scan.  His behavior had not been changed, until it changed as noted earlier in this summary.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
He has had a lumbar fusion.  I believe he's had heart disease.  Mental status changes are either due to the tumor or other psychiatric problems.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
He is living with his wife, next door to one of his children.  He has been disabled since 2001, due to the back problems.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
No headaches or vision issues.  Ongoing heart problems, without complaints.  No weakness, numbness or tingling, except that related to his chronic neck pain.  No history of endocrine problems.  He has nocturia and urinary frequency.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Blood pressure 146/91, pulse 76.  Normal conjunctivae.  Ears, nose, throat normal.  Neck is supple.  Chest clear.  Heart tones normal.  Abdomen soft.  Positive bowel sounds.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  No adenopathy in the neck, supraclavicular or axillary regions.  Neurologically alert.  Cranial nerves are intact.  Strength is 5/5 throughout.
LABORATORY WORK:
White blood count 10.4, hemoglobin 16, platelets not noted.  Sodium 137, calcium 9.1.
IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
Likely recurrent low-grade tumor, possibly evolved to a higher grade, given the MRI and SPECT findings.  Dr. X's note suggests discussing the situation in the tumor board on Wednesday.  He is stable enough.  The pause in his care would not jeopardize his current status.  It would be helpful to get old films and pathology from Abbott Northwestern.  However, he likely will need a re-biopsy, as he is highly suspicious for recurrent tumor and radiation necrosis.  Optimizing his treatment would probably be helped by knowing his current grade of tumor.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm feeling okay. a little tired, but alright.
[doctor] i understand you've been admitted for some symptoms that seemed postictal. can you tell me more about that?
[patient] yes, i was initially taken to a hospital where they did a ct scan. the scan showed edema and slight midline shift so they transferred me here. i haven't had a recurrent seizure but the eeg shows slowing. mri of the brain shows a large inhomogeneous infiltrating right frontotemporal neoplasm surrounding the right middle cerebral artery.
[doctor] i see. do you have a history of brain tumors?
[patient] yes, i was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 1999. i had a biopsy done and the notes suggested it was a glioma, likely an oligodendroglioma, pending a second opinion at a clinic. i was treated primarily with radiation alone and it went well. i haven't had a scan in several years until now.
[doctor] i see. from the mri and spect images, it is likely that the tumor has recurred and it is possible that it has evolved to a higher grade. your case will be discussed with the tumor board on wednesday. in the meantime, we might need to get old films and pathology from abbott northwestern, and you may need a re-biopsy to determine the current grade of your tumor. how have you been feeling lately?
[patient] i've been feeling okay. my behavior changed recently, which led me to come back to the hospital. other than that, i haven't had any headaches or vision issues. i do have ongoing heart problems and urinary frequency.
[doctor] i see. how have you been managing your heart problems and urinary frequency?
[patient] my heart problems have been ongoing, but i don't have any complaints as of now. as for my urinary frequency, i have to go to the bathroom quite often at night.
[doctor] alright. we will make sure to take care of that. thank you for letting me know.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?

"SUBJECTIVE:
The patient is well-known to me.  He comes in today for a comprehensive evaluation.  Really, again he borders on health crises with high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity.  He states that he has reached a critical decision in the last week that he understands that he cannot continue with his health decisions as they have been made, specifically the lack of exercise, the obesity, the poor eating habits, etc.  He knows better and has been through some diabetes training.  In fact, interestingly enough, with his current medications which include the Lantus at 30 units along with Actos, glyburide, and metformin, he achieved ideal blood sugar control back in August 2004.  Since that time he has gone off of his regimen of appropriate eating, and has had sugars that are running on average too high at about 178 over the last 14 days.  He has had elevated blood pressure.  His other concerns include allergic symptoms.  He has had irritable bowel syndrome with some cramping.  He has had some rectal bleeding in recent days.  Also once he wakes up he has significant difficulty in getting back to sleep.  He has had no rectal pain, just the bleeding associated with that.
MEDICATIONS/ALLERGIES:
As above.
PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY:
Reviewed and updated - see Health Summary Form for details.
FAMILY AND SOCIAL HISTORY:
Reviewed and updated - see Health Summary Form for details.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Constitutional, Eyes, ENT/Mouth, Cardiovascular, Respiratory, GI, GU, Musculoskeletal, Skin/Breasts, Neurologic, Psychiatric, Endocrine, Heme/Lymph, Allergies/Immune all negative with the following exceptions:  None.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  As above.
GENERAL:  The patient is alert, oriented, well-developed, obese male who is in no acute distress.
HEENT:  PERRLA.  EOMI.  TMs clear bilaterally.  Nose and throat clear.
NECK:  Supple without adenopathy or thyromegaly.  Carotid pulses palpably normal without bruit.
CHEST:  No chest wall tenderness or breast enlargement.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur, clicks, or rubs.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation and percussion.
ABDOMEN:  Significantly obese without any discernible organomegaly.  GU:  Normal male genitalia without testicular abnormalities, inguinal adenopathy, or hernia.
RECTAL:  Smooth, nonenlarged prostate with just some irritation around the rectum itself.  No hemorrhoids are noted.
EXTREMITIES:  Some slow healing over the tibia.  Without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Peripheral pulses within normal limits.
NEUROLOGIC:  Cranial nerves II-XII intact.  Strength, sensation, coordination, and reflexes all within normal limits.
SKIN:  Noted to be normal.  No subcutaneous masses noted.
LYMPH SYSTEM:  No lymphadenopathy noted.
BACK:  He has pain in his back in general.
ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
1.  Diabetes and hypertension, both under less than appropriate control.  In fact, we discussed increasing the Lantus.  He appears genuine in his desire to embark on a substantial weight-lowering regime, and is going to do that through dietary control.  He knows what needs to be done with the absence of carbohydrates, and especially simple sugar.  He will also check a hemoglobin A1c, lipid profile, urine for microalbuminuria and a chem profile.  I will need to recheck him in a month to verify that his sugars and blood pressure have come into the ideal range.  He has allergic rhinitis for which Zyrtec can be used.
2.  He has irritable bowel syndrome.  We will use Metamucil for that which also should help stabilize the stools so that the irritation of the rectum is lessened.  For the bleeding I would like to obtain a sigmoidoscopy.  It is bright red blood.
3.  For his insomnia, I found there is very little in the way of medications that are going to fix that, however I have encouraged him in good sleep hygiene.  I will look forward to seeing him back in a month.  I will call him with the results of his lab.  His medications were made out.  We will use some Elocon cream for his seborrheic dermatitis of the face.  Zyrtec and Flonase for his allergic rhinitis.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?

"PROBLEM LIST:
1.  Refractory hypertension, much improved.
2.  History of cardiac arrhythmia and history of pacemaker secondary to AV block.
3.  History of GI bleed in 1995.
4.  History of depression.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a return visit to the renal clinic for this patient.  She is an 85-year-old woman with history as noted above.  Her last visit was approximately four months ago.  Since that time, the patient has been considerably more compliant with her antihypertensive medications and actually had a better blood pressure reading today than she had had for many visits previously.  She is not reporting any untoward side effect.  She is not having weakness, dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.  She has no orthopnea.  Her exercise capacity is about the same.  The only problem she has is musculoskeletal and that pain in the right buttock, she thinks originating from her spine.  No history of extremity pain.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
1.  Triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide 37.5/25 mg.
2.  Norvasc 10 mg daily.
3.  Atenolol 50 mg a day.
4.  Atacand 32 mg a day.
5.  Cardura 4 mg a day.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 36.2, pulse 47, respirations 16, and blood pressure 157/56.  THORAX:  Revealed lungs that are clear, PA and lateral without adventitious sounds.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Demonstrated regular rate and rhythm.  S1 and S2 without murmur.  No S3.  I could not hear murmur today.  ABDOMEN:  Above plane, but nontender.  EXTREMITIES:  Revealed no edema.
ASSESSMENT:
This is a return visit for this patient who has refractory hypertension.  This seems to be doing very well given her current blood pressure reading, at least much improved from what she had been previously.  We had discussed with her in the past beginning to see an internist at the senior center.  She apparently had an appointment scheduled and it was missed.  We are going to reschedule that today given her overall state of well-being and the fact that she has no evidence of GFR that is greater than 60%.
PLAN:
The plan will be for her to follow up at the senior center for her routine health care, and should the need arise for further management of blood pressure, a referral back to us.  In the meantime, we will discharge her from our practice.  Should there be confusion or difficulty getting in the senior center, we can always see her back in followup","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm doing okay, thank you.
[doctor] great. so, you're here today for a follow-up on your hypertension. i see that since your last visit, you've been more compliant with your medications and your blood pressure is actually better today than it has been for a while. that's good news.
[patient] yes, i've been taking my medication regularly and haven't had any side effects.
[doctor] that's great to hear. are you experiencing any other symptoms like weakness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing?
[patient] no, i'm not having any of those symptoms.
[doctor] okay. i see that the only issue you're having is musculoskeletal pain in your right buttock, which you believe is originating from your spine. is that correct?
[patient] yes, that's correct. i don't have any history of extremity pain.
[doctor] i understand. i'll make a note of that. can you give me an idea of the pain level on a scale of 1-10?
[patient] it's about a 6 or 7.
[doctor] okay. i'll make a note of that as well. i'd like to do a physical exam if that's okay with you.
[patient] yes, that's fine.

[patient] no, i'm not having any of those symptoms.
[doctor] okay. i see that the only issue you're having is musculoskeletal pain in your right buttock, which you believe is originating from your spine. is that correct?
[patient] yes, that's correct. i don't have any history of extremity pain.
[doctor] alright, got it. can you give me an idea of the pain level on a scale of 1-10?
[patient] um, it's about a 6 or 7.

"SUBJECTIVE:
This is a 6-year-old male who comes in rechecking his ADHD medicines.  We placed him on Adderall, first time he has been on a stimulant medication last month.  Mother said the next day, he had a wonderful improvement, and he has been doing very well with the medicine.  She has two concerns.  It seems like first thing in the morning after he takes the medicine and it seems like it takes a while for the medicine to kick in.  It wears off about 2 and they have problems in the evening with him.  He was initially having difficulty with his appetite but that seems to be coming back but it is more the problems early in the morning after he takes this medicine than in the afternoon when the thing wears off.  His teachers have seen a dramatic improvement and she did miss a dose this past weekend and said he was just horrible.  The patient even commented that he thought he needed his medication.
PAST HISTORY:
Reviewed from appointment on 08/16/2004.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
He is on Adderall XR 10 mg once daily.
ALLERGIES:
To medicines are none.
FAMILY AND SOCIAL HISTORY:
Reviewed from appointment on 08/16/2004.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
He has been having problems as mentioned in the morning and later in the afternoon but he has been eating well, sleeping okay.  Review of systems is otherwise negative.
OBJECTIVE:
Weight is 46.5 pounds, which is down just a little bit from his appointment last month.  He was 49 pounds, but otherwise, fairly well controlled, not all that active in the exam room.  Physical exam itself was deferred today because he has otherwise been very healthy.
ASSESSMENT:
At this point is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, doing fairly well with the Adderall.
PLAN:
Discussed with mother two options.  Switch him to the Ritalin LA, which I think has better release of the medicine early in the morning or to increase his Adderall dose.  As far as the afternoon, if she really wanted him to be on the medication, we will do a small dose of the Adderall, which she would prefer.  So I have decided at this point to increase him to the Adderall XR 15 mg in the morning and then Adderall 5 mg in the afternoon.  Mother is to watch his diet.  We would like to recheck his weight if he is doing very well, in two months.  But if there are any problems, especially in the morning then we would do the Ritalin LA.  Mother understands and will call if there are problems.  Approximately 25 minutes spent with patient, all in discussion.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?

"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a followup for this 69-year-old African American gentleman with stage IV chronic kidney disease secondary to polycystic kidney disease.  His creatinine has ranged between 4 and 4.5 over the past 6 months, since I have been following him.  I have been trying to get him educated about end-stage kidney disease and we have been unsuccessful in getting him into classes.  On his last visit, I really stressed the importance of him taking his medications adequately and not missing some of the doses, and he returns today with much better blood pressure control.  He has also brought a machine at home, and states his blood pressure readings have been better.  He has not gone to the transplant orientation class yet and has not been to dialysis education yet, and both of these I have discussed with him in the past.  He also needs followup for his elevated PSA in the past, which has not been done for over 2 years and will likely need cardiac clearance if we ever are able to evaluate him for transplant.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Really negative.  He continues to feel well.  He denies any problems with shortness of breath, chest pain, swelling in his legs, nausea or vomiting, and his appetite remains good.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
1.  Vytorin 10/40 mg one a day.
2.  Rocaltrol 0.25 micrograms a day.
3.  Carvedilol 12.5 mg twice a day.
4.  Cozaar 50 mg twice a day.
5.  Lasix 40 mg a day.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  On exam, his blood pressure is 140/57, pulse 58, current weight is 67.1 kg, and again his blood pressure is markedly improved over his previous readings.  GENERAL:  He is a thin African American gentleman in no distress.  LUNGS:  Clear.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  Normal S1 and S2.  I did not appreciate a murmur.  ABDOMEN:  Soft.  He has a very soft systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border.  No rubs or gallops.  EXTREMITIES:  No significant edema.
LABORATORY DATA:
Today indicates that his creatinine is 4.5 and stable, ionized calcium 8.5, intact PTH 458, and hemoglobin stable at 10.9.  He is not on EPO yet.  His UA has been negative.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Chronic kidney disease, stage IV, secondary to polycystic kidney disease.  His estimated GFR is 16 mL per minute.  He has no uremic symptoms.
2.  Hypertension, which is finally better controlled.
3.  Metabolic bone disease.
4.  Anemia.
RECOMMENDATION:
He needs a number of things done in terms of followup and education.  I gave him more information again about dialysis education and transplant, and instructed him he needs to go to these classes.  I also gave him websites that he can get on to find out more information.  I have not made any changes in his medications.  He is getting blood work done prior to his next visit with me.  I will check a PSA on him but he needs to get back into see urology, as his last PSA that I see was 37 and this was from 02/05.  He will see me back in about 4 to 6 weeks.","[doctor] hi, how are you doing today?

"Mr. XYZ forgot his hearing aids at home today and is severely hearing impaired and most of the interview had to be conducted with me yelling at him at the top of my voice.  For all these reasons, this was not really under the best circumstances and I had to curtail the amount of time I spent trying to get a history because of the physical effort required in extracting information from this patient.  The patient was seen late because he had not filled in the patient questionnaire.  To summarize the history here, Mr. XYZ who is not very clear on events from the past, sustained a work-related injury some time in 1998.  At that time, he was driving an 18-wheeler truck.  The patient indicated that he slipped off the rear of his truck while loading vehicles to his trailer.  He experienced severe low back pain and eventually a short while later, underwent a fusion of L4-L5 and L5-S1.  The patient had an uneventful hospital course from the surgery, which was done somewhere in Florida by a surgeon, who he does not remember.  He was able to return to his usual occupation, but then again had a second work-related injury in May of 2005.  At that time, he was required to boat trucks to his rig and also to use a chain-pulley system to raise and lower the vehicles.  Mr. XYZ felt a popping sound in his back and had excruciating low back pain and had to be transported to the nearest hospital.  He was MRI'ed at that time, which apparently showed a re-herniation of an L5-S1 disc and then, he somehow ended up in Houston, where he underwent fusion by Dr. W from L3 through S2.  This was done on 12/15/2005.  Initially, he did fairly well and was able to walk and move around, but then gradually the pain reappeared and he started getting severe left-sided leg pain going down the lateral aspect of the left leg into his foot.  He is still complaining of the severe pain right now with tingling in the medial two toes of the foot and significant weakness in his left leg.  The patient was referred to Dr. A, pain management specialist and Dr. A has maintained him on opioid medications consisting of Norco 10/325 mg for breakthrough pain and oxycodone 30 mg t.i.d. with Lunesta 3 mg q.h.s. for sleep, Carisoprodol 350 mg t.i.d.
and Lyrica 100 mg q.daily.  The patient states that he is experiencing no side effects from medications and takes medications as required.  He has apparently been drug screened and his drug screening has been found to be normal.  The patient underwent an extensive behavioral evaluation on 05/22/06 by TIR Rehab Center.  At that time, it was felt that Mr. XYZ showed a degree of moderate level of depression.  There were no indications in the evaluation that Mr. XYZ showed any addictive or noncompliant type behaviors.  It was felt at that time that Mr. XYZ would benefit from a brief period of individual psychotherapy and a course of psychotropic medications.  Of concern to the therapist at that time was the patient's untreated and unmonitored hypertension and diabetes.  Mr. XYZ indicated at that time, they had not purchased any prescription medications or any of these health-related issues because of financial limitations.  He still apparently is not under really good treatment for either of these conditions and on today's evaluation, he actually denies that he had diabetes.  The impression was that the patient had axis IV diagnosis of chronic functional limitations, financial loss, and low losses with no axis III diagnosis.  This was done by Rhonda Ackerman, Ph.D.
a psychologist.  It was also suggested at that time that the patient should quit smoking.  Despite these evaluations, Mr. XYZ really did not get involved in psychotherapy and there was poor attendance of these visits, there was no clearance given for any surgical interventions and it was felt that the patient has benefited from the use of SSRIs.  Of concern in June of 2006 was that the patient had still not stopped smoking despite warnings.  His hypertension and diabetes were still not under good control and the patient was assessed at significant risk for additional health complications including stroke, reduced mental clarity, and future falls.  It was felt that any surgical interventions should be put on hold at that time.  In September of 2006, the patient was evaluated at Baylor College of Medicine in the Occupational Health Program.  The evaluation was done by a physician at that time, whose report is clearly documented in the record.  Evaluation was done by Dr. B.  At present, Mr. XYZ continues on with his oxycodone and Norco.  These were prescribed by Dr. A two and a half weeks ago and the patient states that he has enough medication left to last him for about another two and a half weeks.  The patient states that there has been no recent change in either the severity or the distribution of his pain.  He is unable to sleep because of pain and his activities of daily living are severely limited.  He spends most of his day lying on the floor, watching TV and occasionally will walk a while.  ***** from detailed questioning shows that his activities of daily living are practically zero.  The patient denies smoking at this time.  He denies alcohol use or aberrant drug use.  He obtains no pain medications from no other sources.  Review of MRI done on 02/10/06 shows laminectomies at L3 through S1 with bilateral posterior plates and pedicle screws with granulation tissue around the thecal sac and around the left L4-5 and S1 nerve roots, which appear to be retracted posteriorly.  There is a small right posterior herniation at L1-L2.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Significant for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.  The patient does not know what medications he is taking for diabetes and denies any diabetes.

Hair distribution normal.  Skin temperature normal in both the upper and lower extremities.  The lumbar spine curvature is markedly flattened.  There is a well-healed central scar extending from T12 to L1.  The patient exhibits numerous positive Waddell's signs on exam of the low back with inappropriate flinching and wincing with even the lightest touch on the paraspinal muscles.  Examination of the paraspinal muscles show a mild to moderate degree of spasm with a significant degree of tenderness and guarding, worse on the left than the right.  Range of motion testing of the lumbar spine is labored in all directions.  It is interesting that the patient cannot flex more than 5  in the standing position, but is able to sit without any problem.  There is a marked degree of sciatic notch tenderness on the left.  No abnormal muscle spasms or muscle movements were noted.  Patrick's test is negative bilaterally.  There are no provocative facetal signs in either the left or right quadrants of the lumbar area.

1.  Post-laminectomy low back syndrome.
2.  Left L5-S1 radiculopathy.
3.  Severe cognitive impairment with minimal ***** for rehabilitation or return to work.
4.  Opioid dependence for pain control.
TREATMENT PLAN:
The patient will continue on with his medications prescribed by Dr. Chang and I will see him in two weeks' time and probably suggest switching over from OxyContin to methadone.  I do not think this patient is a good candidate for spinal cord stimulation due to his grasp of exactly what is happening and his cognitive impairment.  I will get a behavioral evaluation from Mr. Tom Welbeck and refer the patient for ongoing physical therapy.  The prognosis here for any improvement or return to work is zero.","[doctor] hi, mr. xyz. how are you feeling today?

"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Patient is a 50-year-old white male complaining of continued lower back pain.  Patient has a history of chronic back pain, dating back to an accident that he states he suffered two years ago.  He states he helped a friend unload a motorcycle from a vehicle two-and-a-half days ago, after which he ""felt it"" in his lower back.  The following day (two days ago), he states he rode to Massachusetts and Maine to pick up clients.  He feels that this aggravated his chronic back pain as well.  He also claims to have a screw in his right hip from a previous surgery to repair a pelvic fracture.  He is being prescribed Ultram, Celebrex, gabapentin, and amitriptyline by his PCP for his chronic back pain.  He states that his PCP has informed him that he does not prescribe opiate medications for chronic back pain.
The patient did self-refer to another physician, who suggested that he follow up at a pain clinic for his chronic back pain to discuss other alternatives, particularly the medications that the patient feels that he needs.  Patient states he did not do this because he was feeling well at that time.
The patient did present to our emergency room last night, at which time he saw Dr. X.  He was given a prescription for 12 Vicodin as well as some to take home last night.  The patient has not picked up his prescription as of yet and informed the triage nurse that he was concerned that he would not have enough to last through the weekend.  Patient states he also has methadone and Darvocet at home from previous prescription and is wondering if he should restart these medicines.  He is on several medications, the list of which is attached to the chart.
MEDICATIONS:
In addition to the aforementioned medications, he is on Cymbalta, pantoprazole, and a multivitamin.
ALLERGIES:
HE IS ALLERGIC TO RELAFEN (ITCHING).
SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient is married and lives with his wife.
Nursing notes were reviewed with which I agree.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,VITAL SIGNS:  Pulse is elevated at 105.  Temp and other vitals signs are all within normal limits.
GENERAL:  Patient is a middle-aged white male who is sitting on the stretcher in no acute distress.
BACK:  Exam of the back shows some generalized tenderness on palpation of the musculature surrounding the lumbar spine, more so on the right than on the left.  There is a well-healed upper lumbar incision from his previous L1-L2 fusion.  There is no erythema, ecchymosis, or soft-tissue swelling.  Mobility is generally very good without obvious signs of discomfort.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
LUNGS:  Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes.
MUSCULOSKELETAL:  With the patient supine, there is some discomfort in the lower back with bent-knee flexion of both hips as well as with straight leg abduction of the left leg.  There is some mild discomfort on internal and external rotation of the hips as well.  DTRs are 1+ at the knees and trace at the ankles.
I explained to the patient that he is suffering from a chronic condition and as his PCP has made it clear that he is unwilling to prescribe opiate medication, which the patient feels that he needs, and he is obligated to follow up at the pain clinic as suggested by the other physician even if he is having a ""good day.""  I explained to him that if he did not investigate other alternatives to what his PCP is willing to prescribe, then on a ""bad day,"" he will have nowhere else to turn.  I explained to him that some emergency physicians do chose to use opiates for a short term as Dr. X did last night.  It is unclear if the patient is looking for a different opiate medication, but I do not think it is wise to give him more, particularly as he has not even filled the prescription that was given to him last night.  I did suggest that he not restart his methadone and Darvocet at this time as he is already on five different medications for his back (Celebrex, tramadol, amitriptyline, gabapentin, and the Vicodin that he was given last night).  I did suggest that we could try a different anti-inflammatory if he felt that the Celebrex is not helping.  The patient is agreeable to this.
ASSESSMENT,1.  Lumbar muscle strain.
2.  Chronic back pain.
PLAN:
At this point in time, I felt that it was safe for the patient to transition to heat to his back which he may use as often as possible.  Rx for Voltaren 75 mg tabs, dispensed 20, sig. one p.o. q.12h. for pain instead of Celebrex.  He may continue with his other medications as directed but not the methadone or Darvocet.  I did urge him to reschedule his pain clinic appointment as he was urged to do originally.  If unimproved this week, he should follow up with Dr. Y.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi. i'm still having lower back pain.
[doctor] i see that you've had chronic back pain for some time now, and that you recently felt it flare up after unloading a motorcycle and taking a long ride. you also have a screw in your right hip from a previous surgery. is that correct?
[patient] yes, that's right. my pcp has prescribed me ultram, celebrex, gabapentin, and amitriptyline, but i'm still experiencing a lot of pain.

[doctor] i understand, but it's important to consider other options now so that you have somewhere to turn on a bad day. it's possible to use opiates for short-term pain relief, but it's not wise to rely on them long-term. instead, we can try a different anti-inflammatory medication if you feel that celebrex isn't helping. how do you feel about that?
[patient] i'm willing to try it.
[doctor] great. i'm going to prescribe you voltaren 75 mg tablets to take every 12 hours for pain relief. you can also continue with your other medications as directed, but it's important not to restart methadone or darvocet. if you're still experiencing pain after this week, please follow up with dr. y.

"REASON FOR VISIT:
New patient visit for right hand pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 28-year-old right-hand dominant gentleman, who punched the wall 3 days prior to presentation.  He complained of ulnar-sided right hand pain and was seen in the emergency room.  Reportedly, he had some joints in his hand pushed back and placed by somebody in emergency room.  Today, he admits that his pain is much better.  Currently, since that time he has been in the splint with minimal pain.  He has had no numbness, tingling or other concerning symptoms.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Negative.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient is a nonsmoker and does not use illegal drugs.  Occasionally drinks.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
A 12-point review of systems is negative.
MEDICATIONS:
None.
ALLERGIES:
No known drug allergies.
FINDINGS:
On physical exam, he has swelling and tenderness over the ulnar dorsum of his hand.  He has a normal cascade.  He has 70 degrees of MCP flexion and full IP flexion and extension.  He has 3 to 5 strength in his grip and intrinsics.  He has intact sensation to light touch in the radial, ulnar, and median nerve distribution.  Two plus radial pulse.
X-rays taken from today were reviewed, include three views of the right hand.  They show possible small fractures of the base of the fourth and third metacarpals.  Joint appears to be located.  A 45-degree oblique view was obtained and confirmed adduction of the CMC joints of the fourth and fifth metacarpals.  His injury films from 09/15/07 were reviewed and demonstrated what appears to be CMC dislocations of the third and fourth metacarpals.
ASSESSMENT:
Status post right third and fourth metacarpal carpometacarpal dislocations.
PLANS:
The patient was placed into a short-arm cast and intrinsic plus.  I would like him to wear this for 2 weeks and then follow up with us.  At that time, we will transition him to an OT splint and begin range of motion activities of the fingers and wrist.  We should see him back in 2 weeks' time at which time he should obtain three views of the right hand and a 45-degree oblique view out of cast.","[doctor] hi, how are you doing today?
[patient] i'm doing okay, thanks.
[doctor] so, i see that you punched a wall three days ago which caused pain in your right hand. can you tell me a little more about it?
[patient] yes, i went to the emergency room and they pushed some joints in my hand back in place. since then, i've been wearing a splint and the pain has been minimal.
[doctor] that's good to hear. do you have any numbness or tingling in your hand?
[patient] no, i don't have any numbness or tingling, just some swelling and tenderness over the ulnar dorsum of my hand.
[doctor] i see. on physical examination, i can see that there is some swelling and tenderness in that area. i also reviewed the x-ray and it appears that there might be small fractures of the base of the fourth and third metacarpals. there is also a dislocation of the third and fourth metacarpals. 
[patient] oh, okay.
[doctor] yes, we will place you in a short-arm cast and intrinsic plus for two weeks. after that, we will transition you to an ot splint and begin range of motion activities of the fingers and wrist. we should see you back in two weeks' time, and then obtain three views of your right hand and a 45-degree oblique view without the cast.

She states that the knee is 35% to 40 % better, but continues to have a constant pinching pain when she full weight bears, cannot handle having her knee in flexion, has decreased range of motion with extension.  Rates her pain in her knee as a 10/10.  She does alternate ice and heat.  She is using Tylenol No. 3 p.r.n. and ibuprofen OTC p.r.n. with minimal relief.
ALLERGIES,1.  PENICILLIN.
2.  KEFLEX.
3.  BACTRIM.
4.  SULFA.
5.  ACE BANDAGES.
MEDICATIONS,1.  Toprol.
2.  Xanax.
3.  Advair.
4.  Ventolin.
5.  Tylenol No.  3.
6.  Advil.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Will be starting the Medifast diet, has discussed this with her PCP, who encouraged her to have gastric bypass, but the patient would like to try this Medifast diet first.  Other than this, denies any further problems with her eyes, ears, nose, throat, heart, lungs, GI, GU, musculoskeletal, nervous system, except what is noted above and below.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,VITAL SIGNS:  Pulse 72, blood pressure 130/88, respirations 16, height 5 feet 6.5 inches.
GENERAL:  This is a 36-year-old white female who is A&O x3, in no apparent distress with a pleasant affect.  She is well developed, well nourished, appears her stated age.
EXTREMITIES:  Orthopedic evaluation of the left knee reveals there to be well-healed portholes.  She does have some medial joint line swelling.  Negative ballottement.  She has significant pain to palpation of the medial joint line, none of the lateral joint line.  She has no pain to palpation on the popliteal fossa.  Range of motion is approximately -5 degrees to 95 degrees of flexion.  It should be noted that she has extreme hyperextension on the right with 95+ degrees of flexion on the right.  She has a click with McMurray.  Negative anterior-posterior drawer.  No varus or valgus instability noted.  Positive patellar grind test.  Calf is soft and nontender.  Gait is stable and antalgic on the left.
ASSESSMENT,1.  Osteochondral defect, torn meniscus, left knee.
2.  Obesity.
PLAN:
I have encouraged the patient to work on weight reduction, as this will only benefit her knee.  I did discuss treatment options at length with the patient, but I think the best plan for her would be to work on weight reduction.  She questions whether she needs a total knee; I don't believe she needs total knee replacement.  She may, however, at some point need an arthroscopy.  I have encouraged her to start formal physical therapy and a home exercise program.  Will use ice or heat p.r.n.  I have given her refills on Tylenol No.  3, Flector patch, and Relafen not to be taken with any other anti-inflammatory.  She does have some abdominal discomfort with the anti-inflammatories, was started on Nexium 20 mg one p.o. daily.  She will follow up in our office in four weeks.  If she has not gotten any relief with formal physical therapy and the above-noted treatments, we will discuss with Dr. X whether she would benefit from another knee arthroscopy.  The patient shows a good understanding of this treatment plan and agrees.","[doctor] hi there, how can i help you today?

"REASON FOR ADMISSION:
Intraperitoneal chemotherapy.
HISTORY:
A very pleasant 63-year-old hypertensive, nondiabetic, African-American female with a history of peritoneal mesothelioma.  The patient has received prior intravenous chemotherapy.  Due to some increasing renal insufficiency and difficulties with hydration, it was elected to change her to intraperitoneal therapy.  She had her first course with intraperitoneal cisplatin, which was very difficultly tolerated by her.  Therefore, on the last hospitalization for IP chemo, she was switched to Taxol.  The patient since her last visit has done relatively well.  She had no acute problems and has basically only chronic difficulties.  She has had some decrease in her appetite, although her weight has been stable.  She has had no fever, chills, or sweats.  Activity remains good and she has continued difficulty with depression associated with type 1 bipolar disease.  She had a recent CT scan of the chest and abdomen.  The report showed the following findings.  In the chest, there was a small hiatal hernia and a calcification in the region of the mitral valve.  There was one mildly enlarged mediastinal lymph node.  Several areas of ground-glass opacity were noted in the lower lungs, which were subtle and nonspecific.  No pulmonary masses were noted.  In the abdomen, there were no abnormalities of the liver, pancreas, spleen, and left adrenal gland.  On the right adrenal gland, a 17 x 13 mm right adrenal adenoma was noted.  There were some bilateral renal masses present, which were not optimally evaluated due to noncontrast study.  A hyperdense focus in the lower pole of the left kidney was felt to most probably represent a hemorrhagic renal cyst.  It was unchanged from February and measured 9 mm.  There was again minimal left pelvic/iliac _______ with right and left peritoneal catheters noted and were unremarkable.  Mesenteric nodes were seen, which were similar in appearance to the previous study that was felt somewhat more conspicuous due to opacified bowel adjacent to them.  There was a conglomerate omental mass, which had decreased in volume when compared to previous study, now measuring 8.4 x 1.6 cm.  In the pelvis, there was a small amount of ascites in the right pelvis extending from the inferior right paracolic gutter.  No suspicious osseous lesions were noted.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
Norco 10 per 325 one to two p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain, atenolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
Levoxyl 75 mcg p.o. daily, Phenergan 25 mg p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. nausea, lorazepam 0.5 mg every 8 hours as needed for anxiety, Ventolin HFA 2 puffs q.6h. p.r.n.
Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily, Norvasc 10 mg p.o. daily, Cymbalta 60 mg p.o. daily, and Restoril 30 mg at bedtime as needed for sleep.
ALLERGIES:
THE PATIENT STATES THAT ON OCCASION LORAZEPAM DOSE PRODUCE HALLUCINATIONS, AND SHE HAD DIFFICULTY TOLERATING ATIVAN.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,VITAL SIGNS:  The patient's height is 165 cm, weight is 77 kg.  BSA is 1.8 sq m.  The vital signs reveal blood pressure to be 158/75, heart rate 61 per minute with a regular sinus rhythm, temperature of 96.6 degrees, respiratory rate 18 with an SpO2 of 100% on room air.
GENERAL:  She is normally developed; well nourished; very cooperative; oriented to person, place, and time; and in no distress at this time.  She is anicteric.
HEENT:  EOM is full.  Pupils are equal, round, reactive to light and accommodation.  Disc margins are unremarkable as are the ocular fields.  Mouth and pharynx within normal limits.  The TMs are glistening bilaterally.  External auditory canals are unremarkable.
NECK:  Supple, nontender without adenopathy.  Trachea is midline.  There are no bruits nor is there jugular venous distention.
CHEST:  Clear to percussion and auscultation bilaterally.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur, gallop, or rub.
BREASTS:  Unremarkable.
ABDOMEN:  Slightly protuberant.  Bowel tones are present and normal.  She has no palpable mass, and there is no hepatosplenomegaly.
EXTREMITIES:  Within normal limits.
NEUROLOGICAL:  Nonfocal.
DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION,1.  Intraperitoneal mesothelioma, partial remission, as noted by CT scan of the abdomen.
2.  Presumed left lower pole kidney hemorrhagic cyst.
3.  History of hypertension.
4.  Type 1 bipolar disease.
PLAN:
The patient will have appropriate laboratory studies done.  A left renal ultrasound is requested to further delineate the possible hemorrhagic cyst in the lower left pole of the left kidney.  Interventional radiology will access for ports in the abdomen.  She will receive chemotherapy intraperitoneally.  The plan will be to use intraperitoneal Taxol.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?

"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension, mild aortic stenosis, and previously moderate mitral regurgitation although not seen recently and I was asked to perform cardiology consultation for her because there was concern for atrial fibrillation after a fall.  Basically the patient states that yesterday she fell and she is not certain about the circumstances, on her driveway, and on her left side hit a rock.  When she came to the emergency room, she was found to have a rapid atrial tachyarrhythmia, and was put on Cardizem with reportedly heart rate in the 50s, so that was stopped.  Review of EKGs from that time shows what appears to be multifocal atrial tachycardia with followup EKG showing wandering atrial pacemaker.  An ECG this morning showing normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs.  Her potassium at that time was 3.1.  She does recall having palpitations because of the pain after the fall, but she states she is not having them since and has not had them prior.  She denies any chest pain nor shortness of breath prior to or since the fall.  She states clearly she can walk and she would be able to climb 2 flights of stairs without problems.
PAST CARDIAC HISTORY:
She is followed by Dr. X in our office and has a history of severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild elevation and PA pressure.  On 05/12/08, preserved left and right ventricular systolic function, aortic sclerosis with apparent mild aortic stenosis, and bi-atrial enlargement.  She has previously had a Persantine Myoview nuclear rest-stress test scan completed at ABCD Medical Center in 07/06 that was negative.  She has had significant mitral valve regurgitation in the past being moderate, but on the most recent echocardiogram on 05/12/08, that was not felt to be significant.  She has a history of hypertension and EKGs in our office show normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs versus wandering atrial pacemaker.  She does have a history of significant hypertension in the past.  She has had dizzy spells and denies clearly any true syncope.  She has had bradycardia in the past from beta-blocker therapy.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Multivitamin p.o. daily.
2.  Aspirin 325 mg once a day.
3.  Lisinopril 40 mg once a day.
4.  Felodipine 10 mg once a day.
5.  Klor-Con 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d.
6.  Omeprazole 20 mg p.o. daily presumably for GERD.
7.  MiraLax 17 g p.o. daily.
8.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. daily.
ALLERGIES:
PENICILLIN.  IT IS LISTED THAT TOPROL HAS CAUSED SHORTNESS OF BREATH IN HER OFFICE CHART AND I BELIEVE SHE HAS HAD SIGNIFICANT BRADYCARDIA WITH THAT IN THE PAST.
FAMILY HISTORY:
She states her brother died of an MI suddenly in his 50s.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
She does not smoke cigarettes, abuse alcohol, nor use any illicit drugs.  She is retired from Morse Chain and delivering newspapers.  She is widowed.  She lives alone but has family members who live either on her property or adjacent to it.

She is not aware of prior history of MI.  She denies diabetes.  She does have a history of GERD.  She notes feeling depressed at times because of living alone.  She denies rheumatologic conditions including psoriasis or lupus.  Remainder of review of systems is negative times 15 except as described above.
PHYSICAL EXAM:
Height 5 feet 0 inches, weight 123 pounds, temperature 99.2 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure has ranged from 160/87 with pulses recorded at being 144, and currently ranges 101/53 to 147/71, pulse 64, respiratory rate 20, O2 saturation 97%.  On general exam, she is a pleasant elderly woman who is hard of hearing, but is alert and interactive.  HEENT:  Shows cranium is  normocephalic and atraumatic.  She has moist mucosal membranes.  Neck veins were not distended.  There are no carotid bruits.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation anteriorly without wheezes.  She is relatively immobile because of her left hip fracture.  Cardiac Exam:  S1, S2, regular rate, frequent ectopic beats, 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, preserved aortic component of the second heart sound.  There is also a soft holosystolic murmur heard.  There is no rub or gallop.  PMI is nondisplaced.  Abdomen is soft and nondistended.  Bowel sounds present.  Extremities without significant clubbing, cyanosis, and there is trivial to 1+ peripheral edema.  Pulses appear grossly intact.  Affect is appropriate.  Visible skin warm and perfused.  She is not able to move because of left hip fracture easily in bed.
DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES/LAB DATA:
Pertinent labs include chest x-ray with radiology report pending but shows only a calcified aortic knob.  No clear pulmonary vascular congestion.  Sodium 140, potassium 3.7, it was 3.1 on admission, chloride 106, bicarbonate 27, BUN 17, creatinine 0.9, glucose 150, magnesium was 2 on 07/13/06.  Troponin was 0.03 followed by 0.18.  INR is 0.93, white blood cell count 10.2, hematocrit 36, platelet count 115,000.
EKGs are reviewed.  Initial EKG done on 08/19/08 at 1832 shows MAT, heart rate of 104 beats per minute, no ischemic changes.  She had a followup EKG done at 20:37 on 08/19/08, which shows wandering atrial pacemaker and some lateral T-wave changes, not significantly changed from prior.  Followup EKG done this morning shows normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs.
IMPRESSION:
She is an 84-year-old female with a history of hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension and mild aortic stenosis admitted after a fall with left hip fracture and she will require surgery.  Telemetry now reviewed, shows predominantly normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs _____ earlier yesterday evening showed burst of multifocal atrial tachycardia and I suspect that was exacerbated by prior hypokalemia, which has been corrected.  There has been no atrial fibrillation documented.  I do not feel these troponins are significant given the stress or fall in prior multifocal atrial tachycardia with increased rate especially in the absence of chest pain or shortness of breath.  She actually describes feeling good exercise capacity prior to this fall.  Given favorable risk to benefit ratio for needed left hip surgery, I feel she may proceed with needed left hip surgery from a cardiac standpoint with continued verapamil, which has been started, which should help control the multifocal atrial tachycardia, which she had and would watch for heart rate with that.  Continued optimization of electrolytes.  The patient cannot take beta-blockers as previously Toprol reportedly caused shortness of breath, although, there was some report that it caused bradycardia so we would watch her heart rate on the verapamil.  The patient is aware of the cardiac risks, certainly it is moderate, and wishes to proceed with needed surgery.  I do not feel any further cardiac evaluation is needed at this time and the patient may followup with Dr. X after discharge.  Regarding her mild thrombocytopenia, I would defer that to hospitalist and continue proton pump inhibitors for history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, management of left hip fracture as per orthopedist.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm feeling okay, thank you.
[doctor] so, i went through your medical history and i see that you fell yesterday and were found to have rapid atrial tachyarrhythmia. how are you feeling now?
[patient] i've been feeling fine since then.
[doctor] great. your potassium level was found to be low at that time, which could have contributed to the atrial tachycardia. but your ekgs today show normal sinus rhythm with frequent apcs. 
[patient] okay.
[doctor] additionally, your chest x-ray showed only a calcified aortic knob, and your labs have been within normal limits except for mild thrombocytopenia. given the favorable risk to benefit ratio, i think it's safe for you to proceed with the needed left hip surgery. we'll continue to monitor your heart rate with the verapamil and optimize your electrolytes.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] you should continue taking your proton pump inhibitors for your history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, and the hospitalist will manage your mild thrombocytopenia. do you have any questions or concerns?
[patient] no, i think i understand.

When the Adult Protective Services actually went to the patient's house, he was found to be having decreased consciousness for a whole day by his wife.  Actually the night before, he fell off his wheelchair and had lacerations on the face.  As per his wife, she states that the patient was given an entire mg of Xanax rather than 0.125 mg of Xanax, and that is why he has had decreased mental status since then.  The patient's wife is not able to give a history.  The patient has not been getting Sinemet and his other home medications in the last 2 days.

"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Patient is a 72-year-old white male complaining of a wooden splinter lodged beneath his left fifth fingernail, sustained at 4 p.m. yesterday.  He attempted to remove it with tweezers at home, but was unsuccessful.  He is requesting we attempt to remove this for him.
The patient believes it has been over 10 years since his last tetanus shot, but states he has been allergic to previous immunizations primarily with ""horse serum.""  Consequently, he has declined to update his tetanus immunization.
MEDICATIONS:
He is currently on several medications, a list of which is attached to the chart, and was reviewed.  He is not on any blood thinners.
ALLERGIES:
HE IS ALLERGIC ONLY TO TETANUS SERUM.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
Patient is married and is a nonsmoker and lives with his wife.
Nursing notes were reviewed with which I agree.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,VITAL SIGNS:  Temp and vital signs are all within normal limits.
GENERAL:  The patient is a pleasant elderly white male who is sitting on the stretcher in no acute distress.
EXTREMITIES:  Exam of the left fifth finger shows a 5- to 6-mm splinter lodged beneath the medial aspect of the nail plate.  It does not protrude beyond the end of the nail plate.  There is no active bleeding.  There is no edema or erythema of the digit tip.  Flexion and extension of the DIP joint is intact.  The remainder of the hand is unremarkable.
TREATMENT:
I did attempt to grasp the end of the splinter with splinter forceps, but it is brittle and continues to break off.  In order to better grasp the splinter, will require penetration beneath the nail plate, which the patient cannot tolerate due to pain.  Consequently, the base of the digit tip was prepped with Betadine, and just distal to the DIP joint, a digital block was applied with 1% lidocaine with complete analgesia of the digit tip.  I was able to grasp the splinter and remove this.  No further foreign body was seen beneath the nail plate and the area was cleansed and dressed with bacitracin and bandage.
ASSESSMENT:
Foreign body of the left fifth fingernail (wooden splinter).
PLAN:
Patient was urged to clean the area b.i.d. with soap and water and to dress with bacitracin and a Band-Aid.  If he notes increasing redness, pain, or swelling, he was urged to return for re-evaluation.","[doctor] hi there, how can i assist you today?

"REASON FOR VISIT:
This is a cosmetic consultation.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a very pleasant 34-year-old white female who is a nurse in the operating room.  She knows me through the operating room and has asked me to possibly perform cosmetic surgery on her.  She is very bright and well informed about cosmetic surgery.  She has recently had some neck surgery for a re-fusion of her neck and is currently on methadone for chronic pain regarding this.  Her current desires are that she obtain a breast augmentation and liposuction of her abdomen, and she came to me mostly because I offer transumbilical breast augmentation.  Her breasts are reportedly healthy without any significant problems.  Her weight is currently stable.
PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY:
Negative.  Past surgical history is significant for a second anterior cervical fusion and diskectomy in 02/05 and in 09/06.  She has had no previous cosmetic or aesthetic surgery.
FAMILY HISTORY AND SOCIAL HISTORY:
Significant for Huntington disease in her mother and diabetes in her father.  Her brother has an aneurysm.  She does occasionally smoke and has been trying to quit recently.  She is currently smoking about a pack a day.  She drinks about once a week.  She is currently a registered nurse, circulator, and scrub technician in the operating room at Hopkins.  She has no children.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
A 12-system review is significant for some musculoskeletal pain, mostly around her neck and thoracic region.  She does have occasional rash on her chest and problems with sleep and anxiety that are related to her chronic pain.  She has considered difficult airway due to anterior cervical disk fusion and instability.  Her last mammogram was in 2000.  She has a size 38C breast.
MEDICATIONS:
Current medications are 5 mg of methadone three times a day and amitriptyline at night as needed.
ALLERGIES:
None.
FINDINGS:
On exam today, the patient has good posture, good physique, good skin tone.  She is tanned.  Her lower abdomen has some excess adiposity.  There is some mild laxity of the lower abdominal skin.  Her umbilicus is oval shaped and of adequate caliber for a transumbilical breast augmentation.  There was no piercing in that region.  Her breasts are C shaped.  They are not ptotic.  They have good symmetry with no evidence of tubular breast deformity.  She has no masses or lesions noted.  The nipples are of appropriate size and shape for a woman of her age.  Her scar on her neck from her anterior cervical disk fusion is well healed.  Hopefully, our scars would be similar to this.
IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
Hypomastia.  I think her general physique and body habitus would accommodate about 300 to 350 cubic centimeter implant nicely.  This would make her fill out her clothes much better, and I think transumbilical technique in her is a good option.  I have discussed with her the other treatment options, and she does not want scars around her breasts if at all possible.  I think her lower abdominal skin is of good tone.  I think suction lipectomy in this region would bring down her size and accentuate her waist nicely.  I am a little concerned about the lower abdominal skin laxity, and I will discuss with her further that in the near future if this continues to be a problem, she may need a mini tummy tuck.  I do think that a liposuction is a reasonable alternative and we could see how much skin tightening she gets after the adiposity is removed.  I will try to set this up in the near future.  I will try to set this up to get the instrumentation from the instrumentation rep for the transumbilical breast augmentation procedure.  Due to her neck issues, we may not be able to perform her surgery but I will check with Dr. X to see if she is comfortable giving her deep sedation and no general anesthetic with her neck being fused.","[doctor] hi, how are you?
[patient] i'm good, thank you.
[doctor] so, i understand that you're interested in cosmetic surgery. can you tell me a little bit about what you're looking for?
[patient] yes, i'm interested in breast augmentation and liposuction of my abdomen. i've heard about transumbilical breast augmentation and i'm interested in that method.
[doctor] okay, i see. and can you tell me a little bit about your medical history? i know you've had some neck surgery and you're currently on methadone for pain.
[patient] yes, i had a re-fusion of my neck and i'm currently taking methadone for chronic pain related to that. i've had no previous cosmetic surgery.
[doctor] okay, good to know. and how about your family history? any significant medical issues there?
[patient] my mother has huntington disease and my father has diabetes. my brother has an aneurysm.
[doctor] i see. and do you smoke or drink alcohol?
[patient] i do smoke about a pack a day, but i've been trying to quit. i drink about once a week.
[doctor] okay. and have you had any recent medical exams or tests done?
[patient] my last mammogram was in 2000.
[doctor] okay. and do you have any concerns or questions about the procedures you're interested in?
[patient] i'm a little concerned about my neck issues and whether that will be a problem during surgery.
[doctor] yes, that's definitely something we need to be aware of. i'll need to check with another doctor to see if it's safe to perform surgery given your neck fusion. but we can definitely discuss your options further and figure out a plan that works for you.","[doctor] hi, how are you today?
[patient] um, i'm good, thank you.
[doctor] so, you're interested in cosmetic surgery, right? could you tell me more about what you're thinking?
[patient] yeah, i'm interested in getting breast augmentation and liposuction on my abdomen. i've heard about this method called transumbilical breast augmentation, and i'm wondering about that.
[doctor] got it. can you give me some background on your medical history? i know you've had neck surgery and you're taking methadone for pain.
[patient] yeah, so i had re-fusion of my neck and i've been using methadone for chronic pain. i haven't had any cosmetic surgery before.
[doctor] okay, good to know. and what about your family history? any important medical issues i should be aware of?
[patient] my mom has huntington's disease, and my dad has diabetes. my brother had an aneurysm.
[doctor] all right. do you smoke or drink alcohol?
[patient] um, i smoke about a pack a day, but i'm trying to quit. i drink about once a week.
[doctor] okay, got it. have you had any recent medical exams or tests?
[patient] um, my last mammogram was in 2000.
[doctor] okay, and do you have any worries or questions about the procedures you're interested in?
[patient] um, i'm a little worried about my neck and whether it'll be safe to have surgery.
[doctor] yeah, that's definitely something we need to check. i'll need to consult with another doctor to make sure it's safe with your neck fusion. but we can discuss your options and come up with a plan that works for you.",9

"SUBJECTIVE:
The patient returns to the Pulmonary Medicine Clinic for followup evaluation of interstitial disease secondary to lupus pneumonitis.  She was last seen in the Pulmonary Medicine Clinic in January 2004.  Since that time, her respiratory status has been quite good.  She has had no major respiratory difficulties; however, starting yesterday she began with increasing back and joint pain and as a result a deep breath has caused some back discomfort.  She denies any problems with cough or sputum production.  No fevers or chills.  Recently, she has had a bit more problems with fatigue.  For the most part, she has had no pulmonary limitations to her activity.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
Synthroid 0.112 mg daily; Prilosec 20 mg daily; prednisone, she was 2.5 mg daily, but discontinued this on 06/16/2004; Plaquenil 200 mg b.i.d.; Imuran 100 mg daily; Advair one puff b.i.d.; Premarin 0.3 mg daily; Lipitor 10 mg Monday through Friday; Actonel 35 mg weekly; and aspirin 81 mg daily.  She is also on calcium, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin C and a multivitamin.
ALLERGIES:
Penicillin and also intolerance to shellfish.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Noncontributory except as outlined above.
EXAMINATION:
General:  The patient was in no acute distress.
Vital signs:  Blood pressure 122/60, pulse 72 and respiratory rate 16.
HEENT:  Nasal mucosa was mild-to-moderately erythematous and edematous.  Oropharynx was clear.
Neck:  Supple without palpable lymphadenopathy.
Chest:  Chest demonstrates decreased breath sounds, but clear.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm.
Abdomen:  Soft and nontender.
Extremities:  Without edema.  No skin lesions.
O2 saturation was checked at rest.  On room air it was 96% and on ambulation it varied between 94% and 96%.  Chest x-ray obtained today showed mild increased interstitial markings consistent with a history of lupus pneumonitis.  She has not had the previous chest x-ray with which to compare; however, I did compare the markings was less prominent when compared with previous CT scan.
ASSESSMENT:
1.  Lupus with mild pneumonitis.
2.  Respiratory status is stable.
3.  Increasing back and joint pain, possibly related to patient’s lupus, however, in fact may be related to recent discontinuation of prednisone.
PLAN:
At this time, I have recommended to continue her current medications.  We would like to see her back in approximately four to five months, at which time I would like to recheck her pulmonary function test as well as check CAT scan.  At that point, it may be reasonable to consider weaning her Imuran if her pulmonary status is stable and the lupus appears to be under control.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm alright, thank you for asking.

[patient] no, nothing out of the ordinary.
[doctor] that's good to hear. i also noticed that you discontinued prednisone on june 16th. do you think the increasing back and joint pain may be related to this?
[patient] it's possible, but it may also be related to my lupus.

"DIAGNOSIS:
Polycythemia vera with secondary myelofibrosis.
REASON FOR VISIT:
Followup of the above condition.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Left shin pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
A 55-year-old white male who carries a diagnosis of polycythemia vera with secondary myelofibrosis.  Diagnosis was made some time in 2005/2006.  Initially, he underwent phlebotomy.  He subsequently transferred his care here.  In the past, he has been on hydroxyurea and interferon but did not tolerate both of them.  He is JAK-2 positive.  He does not have any siblings for a match-related transplant.  He was seen for consideration of a MUD transplant, but was deemed not to be a candidate because of the social support as well as his reasonably good health.
At our institution, the patient received a trial of lenalidomide and prednisone for a short period.  He did well with the combination.  Subsequently, he developed intolerance to lenalidomide.  He complained of severe fatigue and diarrhea.  This was subsequently stopped.
The patient reports some injury to his left leg last week.  His left leg apparently was swollen.  He took steroids for about 3 days and stopped.  Left leg swelling has disappeared.  The patient denies any other complaints at this point in time.  He admits to smoking marijuana.  He says this gives him a great appetite and he has actually gained some weight.  Performance status in the ECOG scale is 1.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  He is afebrile.  Blood pressure 144/85, pulse 86, weight 61.8 kg, and respiratory rate 18 per minute.  GENERAL:  He is in no acute distress.  HEENT:  There is no pallor, icterus or cervical adenopathy that is noted.  Oral cavity is normal to exam.  CHEST:  Clear to auscultation.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  S1 and S2 normal with regular rate and rhythm.  ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender with no hepatomegaly.  Spleen is palpable 4 fingerbreadths below the left costal margin.  There is no guarding, tenderness, rebound or rigidity noted.  Bowel sounds are present.  EXTREMITIES:  Reveal no edema.  Palpation of the left tibia revealed some mild tenderness.  However, I do not palpate any bony abnormalities.  There is no history of deep venous thrombosis.
LABORATORY DATA:
CBC from today is significant for a white count of 41,900 with an absolute neutrophil count of 34,400, hemoglobin 14.8 with an MCV of 56.7, and platelet count 235,000.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1.  JAK-2 positive myeloproliferative disorder.  The patient has failed pretty much all available options.  He is not a candidate for chlorambucil or radioactive phosphorus because of his young age and the concern for secondary malignancy.  I have e-mailed Dr. X to see whether he will be a candidate for the LBH trial.  Hopefully, we can get a JAK-2 inhibitor trial quickly on board.
2.  I am concerned about the risk of thrombosis with his elevated white count.  He is on aspirin prophylaxis.  The patient has been told to call me with any complaints.
3.  Left shin pain.  I have ordered x-rays of the left tibia and knee today.  The patient will return to the clinic in 3 weeks.  He is to call me in the interim for any problems.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, i'm doing okay.
[doctor] i see that you came in for a follow-up appointment regarding your polycythemia vera with secondary myelofibrosis. can you tell me more about what's been going on?
[patient] sure, i've been experiencing some left shin pain lately. i injured it a week ago, and it was swollen, but i took steroids for a few days and the swelling went down. other than that, i haven't had any other complaints.
[doctor] i see. i'm sorry to hear that. i'm going to take a look at your physical examination and laboratory data to see if there are any concerning factors. your vital signs look good, but your cbc shows a high white count. this puts you at risk for thrombosis, so i'm glad you're on aspirin prophylaxis. i've ordered x-rays of your left tibia and knee to see if there are any fractures or abnormalities causing your pain. you'll need to come back in 3 weeks to discuss the results. 
[patient] okay, thank you.
[doctor] additionally, i've emailed dr. x to see if you're a candidate for the lbh trial, and i'm hoping we can get a jak-2 inhibitor trial started soon. you've tried hydroxyurea and interferon before, but you didn't tolerate them. we need to find a medication that works for you. in the meantime, please call me if you have any other concerns or complaints.
[patient] i will, thank you. 
[doctor] and lastly, can you tell me more about your marijuana use? i understand it helps with your appetite, but we need to make sure it's not interfering with your treatment plan.
[patient] yeah, i've been smoking it, but it hasn't caused any issues so far. 
[doctor] alright, i'll make a note of that. we need to make sure we're monitoring everything closely to ensure the best possible outcome.","[doctor] hey there, how's it going today?
[patient] um, hi. i'm doing alright, thanks.
[doctor] okay, so you're here for a check-up on your polycythemia vera with secondary myelofibrosis. can you tell me more about what's been happening lately?
[patient] yeah, so my left shin has been hurting a bit. i injured it a week ago and it was swollen, but i took some steroids for a few days and the swelling went down. other than that, i'm feeling okay.
[doctor] i see. that's not great to hear. let me take a look at your physical exam and lab results to see what's going on. your vital signs look good, but your cbc shows a high white count which means you're at risk for thrombosis. i'm glad you're taking aspirin prophylaxis. i've ordered x-rays of your left tibia and knee to see if there are any fractures or abnormalities causing your pain. we'll discuss the results at your next appointment in 3 weeks. 
[patient] sounds good, thanks.
[doctor] also, i've contacted dr. x to see if you're eligible for the lbh trial, and i'm hoping we can start a jak-2 inhibitor trial soon. we need to find a medication that works for you since you didn't tolerate hydroxyurea and interferon before. and please let me know if you have any other concerns.
[patient] mm-hmm, will do. 
[doctor] lastly, can you tell me more about your marijuana use? i know it helps with your appetite, but we need to make sure it's not hindering your treatment plan.
[patient] oh yeah, i've been smoking a bit, but it hasn't caused any problems yet.
[doctor] okay, got it. we'll keep an eye on everything to make sure you're getting the best possible care.",8
"CHIEF COMPLAINT:
The patient is here for followup visit and chemotherapy.
DIAGNOSES:
1.  Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder.
2.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
3.  Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.
4.  Anemia secondary to chronic renal insufficiency and chemotherapy.
5.  Hypertension.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
A 51-year-old white male diagnosed with PTLD in latter half of 2007.  He presented with symptoms of increasing adenopathy, abdominal pain, weight loss, and anorexia.  He did not seek medical attention immediately.  He was finally hospitalized by the renal transplant service and underwent a lymph node biopsy in the groin, which showed diagnosis of large cell lymphoma.  He was discussed at the hematopathology conference.  Chemotherapy with rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, daunorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone was started.  First cycle of chemotherapy was complicated by sepsis despite growth factor support.  He also appeared to have become disoriented either secondary to sepsis or steroid therapy.
The patient has received 5 cycles of chemotherapy to date.  He did not keep his appointment for a PET scan after 3 cycles because he was not feeling well.  His therapy has been interrupted for infection related to squamous cell cancer, skin surgery as well as complaints of chest infection.
The patient is here for the sixth and final cycle of chemotherapy.  He states he feels well.  He denies any nausea, vomiting, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain or fatigue.  He denies any tingling or numbness in his fingers.  Review of systems is otherwise entirely negative.
Performance status on the ECOG scale is 1.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  He is afebrile.  Blood pressure 161/80, pulse 65, weight 71.5 kg, which is essentially unchanged from his prior visit.  There is mild pallor noted.  There is no icterus, adenopathy or petechiae noted.  CHEST:  Clear to auscultation.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  S1 and S2 normal with regular rate and rhythm.  Systolic flow murmur is best heard in the pulmonary area.  ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender with no organomegaly.  Renal transplant is noted in the right lower quadrant with a scar present.  EXTREMITIES:  Reveal no edema.
LABORATORY DATA:
CBC from today shows white count of 9.6 with a normal differential, ANC of 7400, hemoglobin 8.9, hematocrit 26.5 with an MCV of 109, and platelet count of 220,000.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1.  Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma following transplantation.  The patient is to receive his sixth and final cycle of chemotherapy today.  PET scan has been ordered to be done within 2 weeks.  He will see me back for the visit in 3 weeks with CBC, CMP, and LDH.
2.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
3.  Anemia secondary to chronic renal failure and chemotherapy.  He is to continue on his regimen of growth factor support.
4.  Hypertension.  This is elevated today because he held his meds because he is getting rituximab other than that this is well controlled.  His CMP is pending from today.
5.  Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.  The scalp is well healed.  He still has an open wound on the right posterior aspect of his trunk.  This has no active drainage, but it is yet to heal.  This probably will heal by secondary intention once chemotherapy is finished.  Prescription for prednisone as part of his chemotherapy has been given to him.","[doctor] hi there, how are you doing today?
[patient] i'm doing okay, thank you.
[doctor] good to hear that. so, you are here for your final cycle of chemotherapy, right?
[patient] yes, that's correct.
[doctor] alright. before we proceed with the chemotherapy, can you tell me how you have been feeling lately?
[patient] i have been feeling well, no nausea, vomiting, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, or fatigue. i also don't have any tingling or numbness in my fingers.
[doctor] okay, that's good to hear. how about your wound on your right posterior aspect? is it getting better?
[patient] no, it's still not completely healed.
[doctor] alright, we'll keep an eye on that. now, let's move on to your lab results. your white blood cell count is normal, and your anc is 7400. your hemoglobin and hematocrit are low, and your mcv is high, which is consistent with anemia due to chronic renal insufficiency and chemotherapy. your platelet count is normal. your blood pressure is a bit high, but it's because you held your meds because of the rituximab. we'll wait for your cmp results before adjusting your medications. 
[patient] okay.
[doctor] now, let me remind you that you need to have your pet scan within two weeks after this cycle. you also need to come back to me in three weeks for a follow-up visit with cbc, cmp, and ldh. i will also prescribe you some prednisone as part of your chemotherapy. any questions so far?
[patient] no, i don't have any questions.

"CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Leg pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 56-year-old female who has pain in her legs at nighttime and when she gets up it comes and goes, radiates from her buttocks to her legs, sometimes it is her ankle.  She has noticed it since she has been on Lipitor.  She has had some night sweats occasionally.  She has had a little bit of fever and nausea.  She has noticed her blood sugars have been low.  She has lost over 30 pounds after exercising doing water aerobics at Genesis in Wichita.  She has noticed her fasting blood sugars have been ranging from 100 to 120.  Blood sugars one and a half hours after meals have been 185.  She is coming in for a diabetic checkup in one month and wants lab prior to that time.  She has been eating more meat recently and has not been on a diet for cholesterol.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
Include Lipitor 80 mg q.d. discontinued today, Vioxx 25 mg q.d.
Maxzide 37/25 q.d.
Protonix 40 mg q.d.
hydroxyzine pamoate 50 mg at h.s.
aspirin 81 mg q.d.
Glucovance 1.25/250 b.i.d. decreased to one a day today, Monopril 20 mg q.d.
estradiol one mg q.d.
and glucosamine 1000 mg q.d.
ALLERGIES:
Cipro, sulfa, Bactrim, and Demerol.
OBJECTIVE:
Vital Signs:  Weight is 248 pounds which is a 12-pound drop from January.  Blood pressure 120/70.  Pulse 68.
General:  This is a well-developed adult female, awake, alert, and in no acute distress.
HEENT:  Oropharynx and HEENT are within normal limits.
Lungs:  Clear.
Heart:  Regular rhythm and rate.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, and nondistended without organomegaly.
GU:  Palpation of femurs do not cause pain, rotation of hips do not cause pain, and compression of the hips do not cause pain.
Neurologic:  Deep tendon reflexes are normal.
Extremities:  Pulses in lower extremities are normal.  Straight leg lifts are normal.
ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
1.  Leg pain/bone pain, I am going to check her CMP.  I think this possibly is a side effect from Lipitor.  We will stop Lipitor, have her follow up in one month which she has already got planned for diabetes appointment and check symptoms at that time.  Certainly if her pain improves might consider something like Crestor, which is more water soluble, which may cause less adverse effects.  We will check her comprehensive metabolic panel to make sure the alkaline phosphatase is okay, may need an x-ray of back, hip, and legs at that time if symptoms are not gone.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia, this is somewhat bothersome as she is a diabetic.  Did discuss with her that we need to stick to the diet especially after going off of Lipitor.  We will see how she does with her bone pain/leg pain off of Lipitor.  If she has improvement may consider Crestor in one month.  I am going to check her lipid panel and a CMP.  Apparently, she is going to get this at a different site, Mapleridge in Wichita.
3.  Type II diabetes.  We will decrease her Glucovance because she is having frequent low blood sugars.  Her previous hemoglobin A1c was 5.6 so we will see if this improves her symptoms.  I am also going to check a hemoglobin A1c at Mapleridge in Wichita and have a followup here in one month for that diabetes appointment.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm feeling okay, not great.
[doctor] can you tell me a little bit more about your leg pain? when does it usually occur?
[patient] it usually happens at night and when i get up. it radiates from my buttocks to my legs, and sometimes it's in my ankle.
[doctor] okay. and when did you first start experiencing this pain?
[patient] i noticed it after i started taking lipitor.
[doctor] ah, i see. and have you experienced any other symptoms besides the leg pain?

[doctor] i see. and have you been taking your medications as prescribed?
[patient] yes, i have.

[patient] okay, that sounds good.
[doctor] in addition to the leg pain, i'm also concerned about your hypercholesterolemia, especially since you're diabetic. i'd like to see if we can manage this with diet alone for now, since you're going off of lipitor. we'll check your lipid panel and comprehensive metabolic panel, and i'd like you to follow up with me in one month. we may consider crestor if your symptoms improve after stopping lipitor.
[patient] okay, i'll make sure to stick to my diet.
[doctor] great. and finally, with regards to your diabetes, i'd like to decrease your glucovance because you've been experiencing low blood sugars. we'll check your hemoglobin a1c at mapleridge in wichita and follow up with you in one month for your diabetes appointment. how does that sound?
[patient] that sounds good to me.

"SUBJECTIVE:
The patient is a 7-year-old male who comes in today with a three-day history of emesis and a four-day history of diarrhea.  Apparently, his brother had similar symptoms.  They had eaten some chicken and then ate some more of it the next day, and I could not quite understand what the problem was because there is a little bit of language barrier, although dad was trying very hard to explain to me what had happened.  But any way, after he and his brother got done eating with chicken, they both felt bad and have continued to feel bad.  The patient has had diarrhea five to six times a day for the last four days and then he had emesis pretty frequently three days ago and then has just had a couple of it each day in the last two days.  He has not had any emesis today.  He has urinated this morning.  His parents are both concerned because he had a fever of 103 last night.  Also, he ate half of a hamburger yesterday and he tried drinking some milk and that is when he had an emesis.  He has been drinking Pedialyte, Gatorade, white grape juice, and 7Up, otherwise he has not been eating anything.
MEDICATIONS:
None.
ALLERGIES:
He has no known drug allergies.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Negative as far as sore throat, earache, or cough.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
General:  He is awake and alert, no acute distress.
Vital Signs:  Blood pressure:  106/75.  Temperature:  99.  Pulse:  112.  Weight is 54 pounds.
HEENT:  His TMs are normal bilaterally.  Posterior pharynx is unremarkable.
Neck:  Without adenopathy or thyromegaly.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation.
Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur.
Abdomen:  Benign.
Skin:  Turgor is intact.  His capillary refill is less than 3 seconds.
LABORATORY:
White blood cell count is 5.3 with 69 segs, 15 lymphs, and 13 monos.  His platelet count on his CBC is 215.
ASSESSMENT:
Viral gastroenteritis.
PLAN:
The parents did point out to me a rash that he had on his buttock.  There were some small almost pinpoint erythematous patches of papules that have a scab on them.  I did not see any evidence of petechiae.  Therefore, I just reassured them that this is a viral gastroenteritis.  I recommended that they stop giving him juice and just go with the Gatorade and water.  He is to stay away from milk products until his diarrhea and stomach upset have calmed down.  We talked about BRAT diet and slowly advancing his diet as he tolerates.  They have used some Kaopectate, which did not really help with the diarrhea.  Otherwise follow up as needed.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?

[patient] no, what is it?
[doctor] it stands for bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast. it's a diet that's easy on the stomach and helps with diarrhea. you should slowly advance your diet as you can tolerate it. your parents have used kaopectate, but it didn't help with the diarrhea. if you need any further assistance, you can come back to me.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
General:  She is awake and alert, no acute distress.
Vital Signs:  Blood pressure:  175/86.  Temperature:  She is afebrile.  Pulse:  78.  Respiratory rate:  20.  O2 sat:  93% on room air.
HEENT:  Her TMs are normal bilaterally.  Posterior pharynx is unremarkable.  It should be noted that her uvula did not deviate and neither did her tongue.  When she smiles though she has some drooping of the left side of her face, as well as some mild nasolabial fold flattening.
Neck:  Without adenopathy or thyromegaly.  Carotids pulses are brisk without bruits.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation.
Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur.
Extremities:  Her muscle strength is symmetrical and intact bilaterally.  DTRs are 2+/4+ bilaterally and muscle strength is intact in the upper extremities.  She has a positive Tinel’s sign on her left wrist.
Neurological:  I also took monofilament and she could sense it easily when testing her sensation on her face.
ASSESSMENT:
Bell’s Palsy.
PLAN:
We did get an EKG showed some ST segment changes anterolaterally.  The only EKG I have here is from 1998 and she actually had bypass in 1999, but there certainly does not appear to be anything acute on his EKG.  I assured her that it does not look like she has a stroke.  If she wants to prevent a stroke, obviously quitting her smoking would help.  It should be noted she also takes Synthroid and Zocor.  We are going to give her Valtrex 1 g t.i.d. for seven days and then if she starts noticing any other drooping or worsening of her symptoms on the left side of her face, she needs to come back, but I will not start her on steroids at this time, which she agreed with.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling?
[patient] i'm not feeling well. i'm concerned about having a stroke.
[doctor] okay, tell me what's going on.
[patient] i feel like i have something in my throat. i had dizziness this morning and my left hand and left jaw feel numb. i had an earache a day ago.

[doctor] got it. have you had any chest pain or shortness of breath?
[patient] no, but i feel nauseated at times.
[doctor] okay, let me do a quick physical exam. your vital signs are elevated, but your lungs and heart sound normal. you have some drooping on the left side of your face and a positive tinel's sign on your left wrist. based on your symptoms, it appears to be bell's palsy. we will give you valtrex for seven days and monitor your symptoms. if they worsen or you have any other concerns, please come back to see me.","[doctor] hey, how's it going?
[patient] um, not feeling great. i'm kinda worried about having a stroke.

"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:
This 92-year-old female states that last night she had a transient episode of slurred speech and numbness of her left cheek for a few hours.  However, the chart indicates that she had recurrent TIAs x3 yesterday, each lasting about 5 minutes with facial drooping and some mental confusion.  She had also complained of blurred vision for several days.  She was brought to the emergency room last night, where she was noted to have a left carotid bruit and was felt to have recurrent TIAs.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
The patient is on Lanoxin, amoxicillin, Hydergine, Cardizem, Lasix, Micro-K and a salt-free diet.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
She does not smoke or drink alcohol.
FINDINGS:
Admission CT scan of the head showed a densely calcified mass lesion of the sphenoid bone, probably representing the benign osteochondroma seen on previous studies.  CBC was normal, aside from a hemoglobin of 11.2.  ECG showed atrial fibrillation.  BUN was 22, creatinine normal, CPK normal, glucose normal, electrolytes normal.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
On examination, the patient is noted to be alert and fully oriented.  She has some impairment of recent memory.  She is not dysphasic, or apraxic.  Speech is normal and clear.  The head is noted to be normocephalic.  Neck is supple.  Carotid pulses are full bilaterally, with left carotid bruit.  Neurologic exam shows cranial nerve function II through XII to be intact, save for some slight flattening of the left nasolabial fold.  Motor examination shows no drift of the outstretched arms.  There is no tremor or past-pointing.  Finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin performed well bilaterally.  Motor showed intact neuromuscular tone, strength, and coordination in all limbs.  Reflexes 1+ and symmetrical, with bilateral plantar flexion, absent jaw jerk, no snout.  Sensory exam is intact to pinprick touch, vibration, position, temperature, and graphesthesia.
IMPRESSION:
Neurological examination is normal, aside from mild impairment of recent memory, slight flattening of the left nasolabial fold, and left carotid bruit.  She also has atrial fibrillation, apparently chronic.  In view of her age and the fact that she is in chronic atrial fibrillation, I would suspect that she most likely has had an embolic phenomenon as the cause of her TIAs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
I would recommend conservative management with antiplatelet agents unless a near occlusion of the carotid arteries is demonstrated, in which case you might consider it best to do an angiography and consider endarterectomy.  In view of her age, I would be reluctant to recommend Coumadin anticoagulation.  I will be happy to follow the patient with you.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm feeling okay, thank you.
[doctor] that's good to hear. i was looking at your medical records and i saw that you had a few episodes of slurred speech and numbness in your left cheek. can you tell me more about that?
[patient] yes, that happened last night. it lasted for a few hours, but it went away eventually.
[doctor] i also saw that you had three similar episodes yesterday, each lasting about 5 minutes with facial drooping and some mental confusion. did you experience any other symptoms?
[patient] well, i have had blurred vision for the past few days.
[doctor] i see. you were brought to the emergency room, and they noted that you have a left carotid bruit and were felt to have recurrent tias. they also found a densely calcified mass lesion of the sphenoid bone. do you remember any of that?
[patient] no, i don't remember anything.
[doctor] alright. i performed a physical examination and found that your neurological exam is normal, except for some mild impairment of recent memory and a slight flattening of the left nasolabial fold. you also have atrial fibrillation. based on your age and the fact that you have chronic atrial fibrillation, i suspect that you most likely had an embolic phenomenon as the cause of your tias.
[patient] okay.

[patient] actually, yeah. i've had blurred vision for a few days now.

[patient] no, i don't. 
[doctor] alright, no worries. i did a physical exam and found that your neurological exam is pretty normal, except for some mild impairment of recent memory and a slight flattening of the left nasolabial fold. you also have atrial fibrillation, which makes me think you most likely had an embolic phenomenon as the cause of your tias. 
[patient] mm-hmm. 
[doctor] i suggest we start with conservative management using antiplatelet agents, unless we find a near occlusion of the carotid arteries, in which case we may consider an angiography and endarterectomy. given your age, i'm not too keen on coumadin anticoagulation. i'll make sure to follow up with you. any questions for me?

[doctor] no problem. don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns.",8
"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:
Neurologic consultation was requested by Dr. X to evaluate her seizure medication and lethargy.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is well known to me.  She has symptomatic partial epilepsy secondary to a static encephalopathy, cerebral palsy, and shunted hydrocephalus related to prematurity.  She also has a history of factor V Leiden deficiency.  She was last seen at neurology clinic on 11/16/2007.  At that time, instructions were given to mom to maximize her Trileptal dose if seizures continue.  She did well on 2 mL twice a day without any sedation.  This past Friday, she had a 25-minute seizure reportedly.  This consisted of eye deviation, unresponsiveness, and posturing.  Diastat was used and which mom perceived was effective.  Her Trileptal dose was increased to 3 mL b.i.d. yesterday.
According to mom since her shunt revision on 12/18/2007, she has been sleepier than normal.  She appeared to be stable until this past Monday about six days ago, she became more lethargic and had episodes of vomiting and low-grade fevers.  According to mom, she had stopped vomiting since her hospitalization.  Reportedly, she was given a medication in the emergency room.  She still is lethargic, will not wake up spontaneously.  When she does awaken however, she is appropriate, and interacts with them.  She is able to eat well; however her overall p.o. intake has been diminished.  She has also been less feisty as her usual sounds.  She has been seizure free since her admission.
LABORATORY DATA:
Pertinent labs obtained here showed the following:  CRP is less than 0.3, CMP normal, and CBC within normal limits.  CSF cultures so far is negative.  Dr. Limon's note refers to a CSF, white blood cell count of 2, 1 RBC, glucose of 55, and protein of 64.  There are no imaging studies in the computer.  I believe that this may have been done at Kaweah Delta Hospital and reviewed by Dr. X, who indicated that there was no evidence of shunt malfunction or infection.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
Trileptal 180 mg b.i.d.
lorazepam 1 mg p.r.n.
acetaminophen, and azithromycin.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL:  The patient was asleep, but easily aroused.  There was a brief period of drowsiness, which she had some jerky limb movements, but not seizures.  She eventually started crying and became agitated.  She made attempts to sit by bending her neck forward.  Fully awake, she sucks her bottle eagerly.
HEENT:  She was obviously visually impaired.  Pupils were 3 mm, sluggishly reactive to light.
EXTREMITIES:  Bilateral lower extremity spasticity was noted.  There was increased flexor tone in the right upper extremity.  IV was noted on the left hand.
ASSESSMENT:
Seizure breakthrough due to intercurrent febrile illness.  Her lethargy could be secondary to a viral illness with some component of medication effect since her Trileptal dose was increased yesterday and these are probable explanations if indeed shunt malfunction has been excluded.
I concur with Dr. X's recommendations.  I do not recommend any changes in Trileptal for now.  I will be available while she remains hospitalized.

"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
She is a 28-year-old G1 at approximately 8 plus weeks presented after intractable nausea and vomiting with blood-tinged vomit starting approximately worse over the past couple of days.  This is patient's fourth trip to the emergency room and second trip for admission.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Nonsignificant.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
None.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
No alcohol, drugs, or tobacco.
PAST OBSTETRICAL HISTORY:
This is her first pregnancy.
PAST GYNECOLOGICAL HISTORY:
Not pertinent.
While in the emergency room, the patient was found to have slight low sodium, potassium slightly elevated and her ALT of 93, AST of 35, total bilirubin is 1.2.  Her urine was 3+ ketones, 2+ protein, and 1+ esterase, and rbc too numerous to count with moderate amount of bacteria.  H and H stable at 14.1 and 48.7.  She was then admitted after giving some Phenergan and Zofran IV.  As started on IV, given hydration as well as given a dose of Rocephin to treat bladder infection.  She was admitted overnight, nausea and vomiting resolved to only one episode of vomiting after receiving Maalox, tolerated fluids as well as p.o. food.  Followup chemistry was obtained for AST, ALT and we will plan for discharge if lab variables resolve.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1.  This is a 28-year-old G1 at approximately 8 to 9 weeks gestation with one hyperemesis gravidarum admit for IV hydration and followup.

"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Patient is a 76-year-old white male who presents with his wife stating that he was stung by a bee on his right hand, left hand, and right knee at approximately noon today.  He did not note any immediate reaction.  Since that time, he has noted some increasing redness and swelling to his left hand, but he denies any generalized symptoms such as itching, hives, or shortness of breath.  He denies any sensation of tongue swelling or difficulty swallowing.
The patient states he was stung approximately one month ago without any serious reaction.  He did windup taking Benadryl at that time.  He has not taken anything today for his symptoms, but he is on hydrochlorothiazide and metoprolol for hypertension as well as a baby aspirin each day.
ALLERGIES:
HE DOES HAVE MEDICATION INTOLERANCES TO SULFA DRUGS (HEADACHE), MORPHINE (NAUSEA AND VOMITING), AND TORADOL (ULCER).
SOCIAL HISTORY:
Patient is married and is a nonsmoker and lives with his wife, who is here with him.
Nursing notes were reviewed with which I agree.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,VITAL SIGNS:  Temp and vital signs are all within normal limits.
GENERAL:  In general, the patient is an elderly white male who is sitting on the stretcher in no acute distress.
HEENT:  Head is normocephalic and atraumatic.  The face shows no edema.  The tongue is not swollen and the airway is widely patent.
NECK:  No stridor.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
LUNGS:  Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes.
EXTREMITIES:  Upper extremities, there is some edema and erythema to the dorsum of the left hand in the region of the distal third to fifth metacarpals.  There was some slight edema of the fourth digit, on which he still is wearing his wedding band.  The right hand shows no reaction.  The right knee is not swollen either.
The left fourth digit was wrapped in a rubber tourniquet to express the edema and using some Surgilube, I was able to remove his wedding band without any difficulty.  Patient was given Claritin 10 mg orally for what appears to be a simple local reaction to an insect sting.  I did explain to him that his swelling and redness may progress over the next few days.
ASSESSMENT:
Local reaction secondary to insect sting.
PLAN:
The patient was reassured that this is not a serious reaction to an insect sting and he should not progress to such a reaction.  I did urge him to use Claritin 10 mg once daily until the redness and swelling has gone.  I did explain that the swelling may worsen over the next two to three days, it may produce a large local reaction, but that anti-histamines were still the mainstay of therapy for such a reaction.  If he is not improved in the next four days, follow up with his PCP for a re-exam.","[doctor] hello, sir. how are you feeling today?
[patient] i was stung by a bee on my hands and knee earlier today, and since then, i have noticed swelling and redness in my left hand.

[doctor] alright. i just checked your vitals and exam results, and everything seems to be within normal limits. based on your symptoms, i can see that you had a local reaction to the bee sting.
[patient] what does that mean?
[doctor] it means that the reaction is only limited to the area where you were stung by the bee.
[patient] okay. what should i do?
[doctor] i suggest taking claritin 10 mg once daily to help reduce the swelling and redness. you may experience some progression of swelling and redness over the next few days, but this should not lead to a serious reaction. if you don't see any improvement in the next four days, please follow up with your pcp for a re-exam.

2.  The patient was advised to contact the primary physician for repeat blood pressure check and get started on antihypertensives if it is persistently elevated.
3.  The patient was told that the mole that she is mentioning in her head is no longer palpable and just to observe it for now.
4.  The patient was advised about doing Kegel exercises for urinary incontinence, and we will address this issue again during next clinic visit if it is persistent.

"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Ms. Connor is a 50-year-old female who returns to clinic for a wound check.  The patient underwent an APR secondary to refractory ulcerative colitis.  Subsequently, she developed a wound infection, which has since healed.  On our most recent visit to our clinic, she has her perineal stitches removed and presents today for followup of her perineal wound.  She describes no drainage or erythema from her bottom.  She is having good ostomy output.  She does not describe any fevers, chills, nausea, or vomiting.  The patient does describe some intermittent pain beneath the upper portion of the incision as well as in the right lower quadrant below her ostomy.  She has been taking Percocet for this pain and it does work.  She has since run out has been trying extra strength Tylenol, which will occasionally help this intermittent pain.  She is requesting additional pain medications for this occasional abdominal pain, which she still experiences.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Temperature 95.8, pulse 68, blood pressure 132/73, and weight 159 pounds.  This is a pleasant female in no acute distress.  The patient's abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with a well-healed midline scar.  There is an ileostomy in the right hemiabdomen, which is pink, patent, productive, and protuberant.  There are no signs of masses or hernias over the patient's abdomen.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
This is a pleasant 50-year-old female who has undergone an APR secondary to refractory ulcerative colitis.  Overall, her quality of life has significantly improved since she had her APR.  She is functioning well with her ileostomy.  She did have concerns or questions about her diet and we discussed the BRAT diet, which consisted of foods that would slow down the digestive tract such as bananas, rice, toast, cheese, and peanut butter.  I discussed the need to monitor her ileostomy output and preferential amount of daily output is 2 liters or less.  I have counseled her on refraining from soft drinks and fruit drinks.  I have also discussed with her that this diet is moreover a trial and error and that she may try certain foods that did not agree with her ileostomy, however others may and that this is something she will just have to perform trials with over the next several months until she finds what foods that she can and cannot eat with her ileostomy.  She also had questions about her occasional abdominal pain.  I told her that this was probably continue to improve as months went by and I gave her a refill of her Percocet for the continued occasional pain.  I told her that this would the last time I would refill the Percocet and if she has continued pain after she finishes this bottle then she would need to start ibuprofen or Tylenol if she had continued pain.  The patient then brought up some right hand and arm numbness, which has been there postsurgically and was thought to be from positioning during surgery.  This is all primarily gone away except for a little bit of numbness at the tip of the third digit as well as some occasional forearm muscle cramping.  I told her that I felt that this would continue to improve as it has done over the past two months since her surgery.  I told her to continue doing hand exercises as she has been doing and this seems to be working for her.  Overall, I think she has healed from her surgery and is doing very well.  Again, her quality of life is significantly improved.  She is happy with her performance.  We will see her back in six months just for a general routine checkup and see how she is doing at that time.","[doctor] hi, ms. connor. how are you doing?
[patient] hi, doctor. i am doing well, thank you.
[doctor] i am glad to hear that. i see from your medical notes that you had your stitches removed and you are here for a follow-up of your perineal wound. how is it feeling?

[patient] yes, i am having occasional abdominal pain. i have been taking percocet, but i have run out of it now.
[doctor] i understand. i will give you a refill of percocet for the continued occasional pain, but this will be the last refill. if you have continued pain after you finish this bottle, then you can start taking ibuprofen or tylenol.
[patient] okay, i understand.
[doctor] you also had some questions about your diet. i discussed with you the brat diet consisting of foods that would slow down the digestive tract, such as bananas, rice, toast, cheese, and peanut butter. i advised you to monitor your ileostomy output and to avoid soft drinks and fruit juices. this diet is a trial and error, and you will have to perform some trials over the next few months until you find what foods you can and cannot eat with your ileostomy.
[patient] okay, i will follow the diet plan and monitor my output.
[doctor] that's great. lastly, you mentioned some right-hand and arm numbness, which has been there after your surgery. i feel that it will continue to improve as time passes. i advised you to continue doing hand exercises and this seems to be working for you.

[patient] got it, i'll follow the diet plan and track my output.
[doctor] perfect. lastly, you mentioned some right-hand and arm numbness that started after your surgery. i think it'll continue to improve with time. i suggested you keep doing hand exercises, and it seems to be working out for you.

"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 55-year-old Hispanic male who was seen initially in the office February 15, 2006, with epigastric and right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, dizziness, and bloating.  The patient at that time stated that he had established diagnosis of liver cirrhosis.  Since the last visit the patient was asked to sign a lease of information form and we sent request for information from the doctor the patient saw before, Dr. X in Las Cruces and his primary care physician in Silver City, and unfortunately we did not get any information from anybody.  Also the patient had admission in Gila Medical Center with epigastric pain, diarrhea, and confusion.  He spent 3 days in the hospital.  He was followed by Dr. X and unfortunately we also do not have the information of what was wrong with the patient.  From the patient's report he was diagnosed with some kind of viral infection.  At the time of admission he had a lot of epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,VITAL SIGNS:  Weight 107, height 6 feet 1 inch, blood pressure 128/67, heart rate 74, saturation 98%; pain is 3/10 with localization of the pain in the epigastric area.
HEENT:  PERRLA.  EOM intact.  Oropharynx is clear of lesions.
NECK:  Supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  No thyromegaly.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation and percussion bilateral.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
ABDOMEN:  Not tender, not distended.  Splenomegaly about 4 cm under the costal margin.  No hepatomegaly.  Bowel sounds present.
MUSCULOSKELETAL:  No cyanosis, no clubbing, no pitting edema.
NEUROLOGIC:  Nonfocal.  No asterixis.  No costovertebral tenderness.
PSYCHE:  The patient is oriented x4, alert and cooperative.
LABORATORY DATA:
We were able to collect lab results from Medical Center; we got only CMP from the hospital which showed glucose level 79, BUN 9, creatinine 0.6, sodium 136, potassium 3.5, chloride 104, CO2 23.7, calcium 7.3, total protein 5.9, albumin 2.5, total bilirubin 5.63.  His AST 56, ALT 37, alkaline phosphatase 165, and his ammonia level was 53.  We do not have any other results back.  No hepatitis panels.  No alpha-fetoprotein level.  The patient told me today that he also got an ultrasound of the abdomen and the result was not impressive, but we do not have this result despite calling medical records in the hospital to release this information.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
The patient is a 55-year-old with established diagnosis of liver cirrhosis, unknown cause.
1.  Epigastric pain.  The patient had chronic pain syndrome, he had multiple back surgeries, and he has taken opiate for a prolonged period of time.  In the office twice the patient did not have any abdominal pain on physical exam.  His pain does not sound like obstruction of common bile duct and he had these episodes of abdominal pain almost continuously.  He probably requires increased level of pain control with increased dose of opiates, which should be addressed with his primary care physician.
2.  End-stage liver disease.  Of course, we need to find out the cause of the liver cirrhosis.  We do not have hepatitis panel yet and we do not have information about the liver biopsy which was performed before.  We do not have any information of any type of investigation in the past.  Again, patient was seen by gastroenterologist already in Las Cruces, Dr. X.  The patient was advised to contact Dr. X by himself to convince him to send available information because we already send release information form signed by the patient without any result.  It will be not reasonable to repeat unnecessary tests in that point in time.
We are waiting for the hepatitis panel and alpha-fetoprotein level.  We will also need to get information about ultrasound which was done in Gila Medical Center, but obviously no tumor was found on this exam of the liver.  We have to figure out hepatitis status for another reason if he needs vaccination against hepatitis A and B.  Until now we do not know exactly what the cause of the patient's end-stage liver disease is and my differential diagnosis probably is hepatitis C.  The patient denied any excessive alcohol intake, but I could not preclude alcohol-related liver cirrhosis also.  We will need to look for nuclear antibody if it is not done before.  PSC is extremely unlikely but possible.  Wilson disease also possible diagnosis but again, we first have to figure out if these tests were done for the patient or not.  Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency will be extremely unlikely because the patient has no lung problem.  On his end-stage liver disease we already know that he had low platelet count splenomegaly.  We know that his bilirubin is elevated and albumin is very low.  I suspect that at the time of admission to the hospital the patient presented with encephalopathy.  We do not know if INR was checked to look for coagulopathy.  The patient had an EGD in 2005 as well as colonoscopy in Silver City.  We have to have this result to evaluate if the patient had any varices and if he needs any intervention for that.
At this point in time, I recommended the patient to continue to take lactulose 50 mL 3 times daily.  The patient tolerated it well; no diarrhea at this point in time.  I also recommended for him to contact his primary care physician for increased dose of opiates for him.  As a primary prophylaxis of GI bleeding in patient with end-stage liver disease we will try to use Inderal.  The patient got a prescription for 10 mg pills.  He will take 10 mg twice daily and we will gradually increase his dose until his heart rate will drop to 25% from 75% to probably 60-58.  The patient was educated how to use Inderal and he was explained why we decided to use this medication.  The patient will hold this medication if he is orthostatic or bradycardic.
Again, the patient and his wife were advised to contact all offices they have seen before to get information about what tests were already done and if on the next visit in 2 weeks we still do not have any information we will need to repeat all these tests I mentioned above.
We also discussed nutrition issues.  The patient was provided information that his protein intake is supposed to be about 25 g per day.  He was advised not to over-eat protein and advised not to starve.  He also was advised to stay away from alcohol.  His next visit is in 2 weeks with all results available.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm not doing great, doctor. i've been experiencing a lot of abdominal pain, nausea, and bloating.
[doctor] i see. can you tell me more about your past medical history? specifically, your liver cirrhosis.
[patient] yes, i was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis a while back, but we don't know the cause. i've been in a lot of pain lately, and i've been taking opiates for a while now.
[doctor] i understand. we're still waiting for some lab results, but based on what we know, i suspect you might have hepatitis c. we need to determine the cause of your liver cirrhosis and get more information about any tests you've had in the past.
[patient] i've been trying to get information from my previous doctors, but they haven't sent anything over. is there anything else i can do?
[doctor] yes, i recommend you contact your previous doctors yourself and ask them to send over any available information. if we still don't have the information we need by your next visit, we may need to repeat some tests.
[patient] okay, i'll do that. in the meantime, what can i do to manage my pain?
[doctor] we may need to increase your dose of opiates, but i recommend you contact your primary care physician to discuss this. additionally, i'm prescribing inderal to help prevent gi bleeding. we will gradually increase your dose until your heart rate drops to around 60-58. make sure to hold the medication if you feel orthostatic or bradycardic.
[patient] okay, i'll contact my primary care physician about my opiates. and i'll make sure to take the inderal as prescribed.
[doctor] great. we also need to monitor your protein intake. you should aim for around 25g per day, but make sure not to overeat protein or starve yourself. additionally, avoid alcohol.
[patient] got it. thank you, doctor.
[doctor] of course. we'll schedule a follow-up visit in two weeks once we have more information.","[doctor] hey there, how's it going? how are you feeling today?

"SUBJECTIVE:
The patient returns today for a followup.  She was recently in the hospital and was found to be septic from nephrolithiasis.  This was all treated.  She did require a stent in the left ureter.  Dr. XYZ took care of this.  She had a stone, which was treated with lithotripsy.  She is now back here for followup.  I had written out all of her medications with their dose and schedule on a progress sheet.  I had given her instructions regarding follow up here and follow with Dr. F.  Unfortunately, that piece of paper was lost.  Somehow between the hospital and home she lost it and has not been able to find it.  She has no followup appointment with Dr. F.  The day after she was dismissed, her nephew called me stating that the prescriptions were lost, instructions were lost, etc.  Later she apparently found the prescriptions and they were filled.  She tells me she is taking the antibiotic, which I believe was Levaquin and she has one more to take.  She had no clue as to seeing Dr. XYZ again.  She says she is still not feeling very well and feels somewhat sick like.  She has no clue as to still having a ureteral stent.  I explained this to she and her husband again today.

"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 65-year-old female who underwent left upper lobectomy for stage IA non-small cell lung cancer.  She returns for a routine surveillance visit.
She has undergone since her last visit an abdominopelvic CT, which shows an enlarging simple cyst of the left kidney.  She underwent barium swallow, which demonstrates a small sliding hiatal hernia with minimal reflux.  She has a minimal delayed emptying secondary tertiary contractions.  PA and lateral chest x-ray from the 11/23/09 was also reviewed, which demonstrates no lesions or infiltrates.  Review of systems, the patient continues to have periodic odynophagia and mid thoracic dysphagia.  This most likely is secondary to tertiary contractions with some delayed emptying.  She has also had increased size of the left calf without tenderness, which has not resolved over the past several months.  She has had a previous DVT in 1975 and 1985.  She denies weight loss, anorexia, fevers, chills, headaches, new aches or pains, cough, hemoptysis, shortness of breath at rest, or dyspnea on exertion.

This is a 29-year-old Vietnamese female, established patient of dermatology, last seen in our office on 07/13/04.  She comes in today as a referral from ABC, D.O. for a reevaluation of her hand eczema.  I have treated her with Aristocort cream, Cetaphil cream, increased moisturizing cream and lotion, and wash her hands in Cetaphil cleansing lotion.  She comes in today for reevaluation because she is flaring.  Her hands are very dry, they are cracked, she has been washing with soap.  She states that the Cetaphil cleansing lotion apparently is causing some burning and pain because of the fissures in her skin.  She has been wearing some gloves also apparently.  The patient is single.  She is unemployed.

[patient] i think it's because i've been washing my hands with soap and the cetaphil cleansing lotion is causing some burning and pain because of the cracks in my skin.
[doctor] i see. that makes sense. in terms of treatment, i think we should apply aristocort ointment and polysporin ointment three times a day and as needed for itching. it's also important to discontinue washing your hands with hot soapy water and switch to the cetaphil cleansing lotion. additionally, i'm going to prescribe keflex to help clear up any infection that might be causing your symptoms. does that sound okay to you?
[patient] yes, that sounds good. thank you.

"CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Septal irritation.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 39-year-old African-American female status post repair of septal deviation but unfortunately, ultimately ended with a large septal perforation.  The patient has been using saline nasal wash 2-3 times daily, however, she states that she still has discomfort in her nose with a ""stretching"" like pressure.  She says her nose is frequently dry and she occasionally has nosebleeds due to the dry nature of her nose.  She has no other complaints at this time.
PHYSICAL EXAM:
GENERAL:  This is a pleasant African-American female resting in the examination room chair in no apparent distress.
ENT:  External auditory canals are clear.  Tympanic membrane shows no perforation, is intact.
NOSE:  The patient has a slightly deviated right septum.  Septum has a large perforation in the anterior 2/3rd of the septum.  This appears to be well healed.  There is no sign of crusting in the nose.
ORAL CAVITY:  No lesions or sores.  Tonsils show no exudate or erythema.
NECK:  No cervical lymphadenopathy.
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98 degrees Fahrenheit, pulse 77, respirations 18, blood pressure 130/73.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
The patient is a 40-year-old female with a past medical history of repair of deviated septum with complication of a septal perforation.  At this time, the patient states that her septal perforation bothers her as she feels that she has very dry air through her nose as well as occasional epistaxis.  At this time, I counseled the patient on the risks and benefits of surgery.  She will consider surgery but at this time, would like to continue using the saline nasal wash as well as occasional Bactroban to the nose if there is occasional irritation or crusting, which she will apply with the edge of a Q-tip.  We will see her back in 3 weeks and if the patient does not feel relieved from the Bactroban as well as saline nasal spray wash, we will consider setting the patient for surgery at that time.","[doctor] hi, how are you doing today?
[patient] i am doing okay.

DETAILS:
I performed a transabdominal ultrasound today using a 4 MHz transducer.  There is a twin gestation in the vertex transverse lie with an anterior placenta and a normal amount of amniotic fluid surrounding both of the twins.  The fetal biometry of twin A is as follows.  The biparietal diameter is 4.9 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 5 days, head circumference 17.6 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 1 day, the abdominal circumference is 15.0 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 2 days, and femur length is 3.1 cm consistent with 19 weeks and 5 days, and the humeral length is 3.0 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 0 day.  The average gestational age by ultrasound is 20 weeks and 1 day and the estimated fetal weight is 353 g.  The following structures are seen as normal on the fetal anatomical survey, the shape of the fetal head, the choroid plexuses, the cerebellum, nuchal fold thickness, the fetal spine and fetal face, the four-chamber view of the fetal heart, the outflow tracts of the fetal heart, the stomach, the kidneys, and cord insertion site, the bladder, the extremities, the genitalia, the cord, which appeared to have three vessels and the placenta.
Limited in views of baby A with a nasolabial region.
The following is the fetal biometry for twin B. The biparietal diameter is 4.7 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 2 days, head circumference 17.5 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 0 day, the abdominal circumference is 15.5 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 5 days, the femur length is 3.3 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 3 days, and the humeral length is 3.1 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 2 days, the average gestational age by ultrasound is 22 weeks and 2 days, and the estimated fetal weight is 384 g.  The following structures were seen as normal on the fetal anatomical survey.  The shape of the fetal head, the choroid plexuses, the cerebellum, nuchal fold thickness, the fetal spine and fetal face, the four-chamber view of the fetal heart, the outflow tracts of the fetal heart, the stomach, the kidneys, and cord insertion site, the bladder, the extremities, the genitalia, the cord, which appeared to have three vessels, and the placenta.  Limited on today's ultrasound the views of nasolabial region.
In summary, this is a twin gestation, which may well be monochorionic at 20 weeks and 1 day.  There is like gender and a single placenta.  One cannot determine with certainty whether or not this is a monochorionic or dichorionic gestation from the ultrasound today.
I sat with the patient and her husband and discussed alternative findings and the complications.  We focused our discussion today on the association of twin pregnancy with preterm delivery.  We discussed the fact that the average single intrauterine pregnancy delivers at 40 weeks' gestation while the average twin delivery occurs at 35 weeks' gestation.  We discussed the fact that 15% of twins deliver prior to 32 weeks' gestation.  These are the twins which we have the most concern regarding the long-term prospects of prematurity.  We discussed several etiologies of preterm delivery including preterm labor, incompetent cervix, premature rupture of the fetal membranes as well as early delivery from preeclampsia and growth restriction.  We discussed the use of serial transvaginal ultrasound to assess for early cervical change and the use of serial transabdominal ultrasound to assess for normal interval growth.  We discussed the need for frequent office visits to screen for preeclampsia.  We also discussed treatment options such as cervical cerclage, bedrest, tocolytic medications, and antenatal steroids.  I would recommend that the patient return in two weeks for further cervical assessment and assessment of fetal growth and well-being.
In closing, I do want to thank you very much for involving me in the care of your delightful patient.  I did review all of the above findings and recommendations with the patient today at the time of her visit.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if I could be of any further help to you.

PERSONAL AND SOCIAL HISTORY:
Mr. T was born in Dwyne, Missouri, with no complications associated with his birth.  Originally, he was raised by both parents, but they separated at an early age.  When he was about seven years old, he was raised by his mother and stepfather.  He did not sustain a relationship with his biological father from that time on.  He stated his parents moved a lot, and because this many times he was picked on in his new environments, Mr. T stated he was, at times, a rebellious teenager, but he denied any significant inability to socialize, and denied any learning disabilities or the need for special education.
Mr. T stated his stepfather was somewhat verbally abusive, and that he committed suicide when Mr. T was 18 years old.  He graduated from high school and began work at Dana Corporation for two to three years, after which he worked as an energy, auditor for a gas company.  He then became a homemaker while his wife worked for Chrysler for approximately two years.  Mr. T was married for eleven years, and divorced in 1993.  He has a son who is currently 20 years old.

Mental Status Exam:  Mr. T presented with a hyper vigilant appearance, his eye contact was appropriate to the interview, and his motor behavior was tense.  At times he showed some involuntary movements that would be more akin to a resting tremor.  There was no psychomotor retardation, but there was some mild psychomotor excitement.  His speech was clear, concise, but pressured.  His attitude was overly negative and his mood was significant for moderate depression, anxiety, anhedonia and loneliness, and mild evidence of anger.  There was no evidence of euphoria or diurnal mood variation.  His affective expression was restricted range, but there was no evidence of lability.  At times, his affective tone and facial expressions were inappropriate to the interview.  There was no evidence of auditory, visual, olfactory, gustatory, tactile or visceral hallucinations.  There was no evidence of illusions, depersonalizations, or derealizations.  Mr. T presented with a sequential and goal directed stream of thought.  There was no evidence of incoherence, irrelevance, evasiveness, circumstantiality, loose associations, or concrete thinking.  There was no evidence of delusions; however, there was some ambivalence, guilt, and self-derogatory thoughts.  There was evidence of concreteness for similarities and proverbs.  His intelligence was average.  His concentration was mildly impaired, and there was no evidence of distractibility.  He was oriented to time, place, person and situation.  There was no evidence of clouded consciousness or dissociation.  His memory was intact for immediate, recent, and remote events.
He presented with poor appetite, easily fatigued, and decreased libidinal drive, as well as excessive somnolence.  There was a moderate preoccupation with his physical health pertaining to his headaches.  His judgment was poor for finances, family relations, social relations, employment, and, at this time, he had no future plans.  Mr. T's insight is somewhat moderate as he is aware of his contribution to the problem.  His motivation for getting well is good as he accepts offered treatment, complies with recommended treatment, and seeks effective treatments.  He has a well-developed empathy for others and capacity for affection.
There was no evidence of entitlement, egocentricity, controllingness, intimidation, or manipulation.  His credibility seemed good.  There was no evidence for potential self-injury, suicide, or violence.  The reliability and completeness of information was very good, and there were no barriers to communication.  The information gathered was based on the patient's self-report and objective testing and observation.  His attitude toward the examiner was neutral and his attitude toward the examination process was neutral.  There was no evidence for indices of malingering as there was no marked discrepancy between claimed impairment and objective findings, and there was no lack of cooperation with the evaluation or poor compliance with treatment, and no evidence of antisocial personality disorder.
IMPRESSIONS:
Major Depressive Disorder, single episode,RECOMMENDATIONS AND PLAN:
I recommend Mr. T continue with psychopharmacologic care as well as psychotherapy.  At this time, the excessive amount of psychiatric symptoms would impede Mr. T from seeking employment.  Furthermore, it appears that the primary precipitating event had occurred on March 25, 2003, when Mr. T was fired from his job after being harassed for over a year.  As Mr. T placed his entire identity and sense of survival on his work, this was a deafening blow to his psychological functioning.  Furthermore, it only appears logical that this would precipitate a major depressive episode.","[doctor] hi, mr. t. how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, doctor. not so great. i've been having muscle tremors, constant headaches, and i feel excessively nervous all the time. i can't even concentrate and have lost interest in everything that used to make me happy.
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that. when did these symptoms start?
[patient] it's been about two months now.
[doctor] i see. have you had suicidal thoughts or attempts?
[patient] yes, but they're currently in remission. however, i still have hopeless thoughts and crying spells.
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that. now, you mentioned that you were fired from your job. can you tell me more about that?
[patient] yes, it was due to an event where i was being harassed by another employee for over a year. it all came to a head one day when the other employee confronted me and spat on me. i retaliated, and i got fired.
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that. have you had any other significant stressors in your life recently?
[patient] no, not really. work was my entire life, and i based my identity on my work ethic.
[doctor] i see. now, have you ever had any psychiatric hospitalizations or interventions before this?
[patient] no, i haven't.
[doctor] and what about substance abuse history?
[patient] i used alcohol after my divorce in 1993, but i haven't used it in the last two years.
[doctor] i understand. now, based on your symptoms and history, i believe you have major depressive disorder, single episode. i recommend you continue with psychopharmacologic care and psychotherapy. it's important to address these symptoms before seeking employment again. how do you feel about that?
[patient] i understand. i just want to feel better.
[doctor] i hear you. we'll work together to find the best treatment plan for you.","[doctor] hey there, mr. t. how you doin' today?
[patient] hi, doc. not so great, ya know? i've been having muscle tremors, constant headaches, and i feel excessively nervous all the time. i can't even concentrate and have lost interest in everything that used to make me happy.
[doctor] ah, i'm sorry to hear that. when did these symptoms start, if you don't mind me asking?
[patient] it's been about two months now, i think.
[doctor] okay, got it. have you had any suicidal thoughts or attempts?
[patient] yeah, but they're under control for now. i still have hopeless thoughts and crying spells sometimes, though.
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that. so you mentioned you got fired from your job. can you tell me more about what happened?
[patient] yeah, so there was this guy who had been harassing me for over a year, and then one day he confronted me and spat on me. i lost my temper and retaliated, and then i got fired.
[doctor] oh, man. i'm sorry to hear that. have you had any other major stressors in your life recently?
[patient] no, not really. work was pretty much my whole life, and i based my identity on it.
[doctor] i see. and have you ever been hospitalized or had any psychiatric interventions before?
[patient] nope, never.
[doctor] alright, and what about substance abuse? have you used anything recently?
[patient] i used to drink after my divorce in '93, but i haven't had anything in the last two years.
[doctor] okay, i understand. so based on everything you've told me, it sounds like you have major depressive disorder, single episode. i recommend you continue with psychopharmacologic care and psychotherapy, and focus on getting better before seeking employment again. how do you feel about that?
[patient] yeah, i understand. i just want to feel like myself again.
[doctor] i hear you, man. we're gonna work together to find the best treatment plan for you.",7

[patient] yes, i have! i'm really excited.
[doctor] that's great! okay, let's go ahead and get started with the physical exam. i'm just going to check your vitals first. your weight and height are both in the 40th percentile, which is good. your body mass index is also in the 40th percentile. your temperature, pulse, and blood pressure are all normal.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] moving on to your head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat, everything looks good. your vision is 20/20 and your hearing is normal. your abdomen and respiratory system are also normal. your cardiovascular system is regular, and your back and extremities are good. i do see a rash on your left thigh and lower right leg. and a slight rash on your abdomen near the panty line. do you have any allergies?
[patient] no.
[doctor] alright. based on my assessment, i'm going to prescribe you atarax and elocon ointment for the rash. i also gave you your first hepatitis a vaccine and talked to you about breast exams, seatbelt use, and sunscreen. make sure to find a primary care physician and allergist when you move to texas. if your rash doesn't improve, you may need to take po steroid medication. also, make sure to clean your clothes and bedding in case you have any poison ivy oil on them.

"HISTORY:
The patient was in the intensive care unit setting; he was intubated and sedated.  The patient is a 55-year-old patient, who was admitted secondary to a diagnosis of pancreatitis, developed hypotension and possible sepsis and respiratory as well as renal failure and found to be intubated.  He has been significantly hypotensive during his stay in the intensive care unit and has had minimal urine output.  His creatinine has gone from 2.1 to 4.2 overnight and the patient also developed florid acidosis and hypokalemia.  Nephrology input has been requested for management of acute renal failure and acidosis.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Pancreatitis.
2.  Poison ivy.  The patient has recently been on oral steroids.
3.  Hypertension.
MEDICATIONS:
Include Ambien, prednisone, and blood pressure medication, which is not documented in the record at the moment.
INPATIENT MEDICATIONS:
Include Protonix IV, half-normal saline at 125 mL an hour, D5W with 3 ounces of bicarbonate at 150 mL an hour.  The patient was initially on dopamine, which has now been discontinued.  The patient remains on Levophed and Invanz 1 g IV q.24 h.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Vitals, emergency room presentation, the blood pressure was 82/45.  His blood pressure in the ICU had dipped down into the 60s systolic, most recent blood pressure is 108/67 and he has been maintained on 100% FiO2.  The patient has had minimal urine output since admission.  HEENT, the patient is intubated at the moment.  Neck examination, no overt lymph node enlargement.  No jugular venous distention.  Lungs examination is benign in terms of crackles.  The patient has some harsh breath sounds secondary to being intubated.  CVS, S1 and S2 are fairly regular at the moment.  There is no pericardial rub.  Abdominal examination, obese, but benign.  Extremity examination reveals no lower extremity edema.  CNS, the patient is intubated and sedated.
LABORATORY DATA:
Blood work, sodium 152, potassium 2.7, bicarbonate 13, BUN 36, and creatinine 4.2.  The patient's BUN and creatinine yesterday were 23 and 2.1 respectively.  H&H of 17.7 and 51.6, white cell count of 8.4 from earlier on this morning.  The patient's liver function tests are all out of whack and his alkaline phosphatase is 226, ALT is 539, CK 1103, INR 1.66, and ammonia level of 55.  Latest ABGs show a pH of 7.04, bicarbonate of 10.7, pCO2 of 40.3, and pO2 of 120.7.
ASSESSMENT:
1.  Acute renal failure, which in all probability is secondary to acute tubular necrosis and sepsis and significant hypotension, but the patient is at the moment on 100% FiO2.  He has been given intravenous fluid at a high rate to replete intravascular volume and to hopefully address his acidosis.  The patient also has significant acidosis and his creatinine has increased from 2.1 to 4.2 overnight.  Given the fact that he would need dialytic support for his electrolyte derangements and for volume control, I would suggest continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration as opposed to conventional hemodialysis as the patient will not be able to tolerate conventional hemodialysis given his hemodynamic instability.
2.  Hypotension, which is significant and is related to his sepsis.  Now the patient has been maintained on Levophed and high rate of intravenous fluid at the moment.
3.  Acidosis, which is again secondary to his renal failure.  The patient was administered intravenous bicarbonate as mentioned above.  Dialytic support in the form of continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration was highly recommended for possible correction of his electrolyte derangements.
4.  Pancreatitis, which has been managed by his gastroenterologist.
5.  Sepsis, the patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy.
6.  Hypercalcemia.  The patient has been given calcium chloride.  We will need to watch for rebound hypercalcemia.
7.  Hypoalbuminemia.
8.  Hypokalemia, which has been repleted.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Again include continuation of IV fluid and bicarbonate infusion as well as transfer to the Piedmont Hospital for continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration.","[doctor] hi, i'm dr. smith, how are you feeling today?
[patient] (unable to speak as the patient is intubated)
[doctor] i see that you were admitted because of pancreatitis which has led to renal failure and acidosis. you also have hypotension and sepsis. how are you feeling currently?
[patient] (unable to speak)

"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
History as provided primarily by the patient's daughter, as well as the referring physician revealed an approximately two-year history of colon cancer initially diagnosed when the patient presented with a swelling in his groin.  Approximately one month ago, he presented with abdominal pain and presented to the hospital with transverse colon obstruction.  He had a diverting colostomy performed approximately one month ago.  Approximately two weeks ago, he was admitted to hospital with infection of this with chronically swollen lower extremities and is home now for approximately one week.  He was deemed not to be a candidate for chemotherapy or radiation on the basis of extensive disease, as well as a longstanding history of cirrhosis with esophageal varices.  Additional history includes an enlarged heart and chronic lower extremity edema associated with trauma from his time as an army infantryman in Korea many decades ago.  The patient is alert and lives alone, although the daughter Ruby is in from out of town for several weeks to care for him.  He denies any particular problems with the exception of itch and a site of leakage around his ostomy site.  His appetite is notably improved since discharge from hospital and both he and his daughter believe he has gained a few pounds of weight.  His stooling is regular.  There is no fever.  Of greatest concern to his daughter is a possibility that his colostomy might be reversible and at the recommendation of some of the physicians at the referring hospital, he was to have had a PET scan to assess whether the ostomy is reversible for various reasons, primarily insurance.  The PET scan has not been done and the family is quite concerned about a potential surgical intervention.  The patient denies anxiety or depression and there is no history of same.  He was married for over 50 years and now widowed for nearly 10.  He is a stepfather to five children and he has seven of his own, all in all raising 12 children.  His daughters, Ruby and Camilla are most involved with the patient's care.  The patient is retired, worked in supermarkets for many years when he is very proud of his time as an infantryman in Korea.  He did sustain an injury to the right eye during his service.  He has lots of children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren and seems to derive great pleasure from them.  He denies spiritual or religious distress.  As to advanced directives, the patient appears not to have any significant advanced directives, written or oral.  Family apparently is working on a ""plan."",MEDICATIONS:
Medications include Toprol 12.5 mg twice daily, Lasix 20 mg daily, ranitidine 75 mg daily, potassium 20 mEq daily, Benadryl 25-50 mg at the hour of sleep as needed, not typically taken and a prescription in the house for Keflex 500 mg q.i.d. for red legs has not yet begun.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Examination reveals am alert pale, but thin gentleman with evident wasting.  He is seated and walks without assistance.  His blood pressure is 135/75.  Pulse is 80.  Respiratory rate is 14.  He is afebrile.  Head is without icterus.  Pupils are equal and round.  He has a red dry tongue without leaking mucosal lesions.  There is no jugular venous distention.  The chest has increased AP diameter with good air entry bilaterally.  There is a systolic ejection murmur heard over the entire precordium.  The rate is regular.  The abdomen, he has a right-sided colostomy with a prolapsed bowel.  There is an area of approximately 5 cm x 8 cm of erythema adjacent to the ostomy.  The skin is intact.  The bowel sounds are active.  There is no tenderness in the abdomen and no palpable masses.  Extremities show chronic lymphedema.  The right lower extremity has an 8 cm x 10 cm patch over the anterior shin that is darkened, but not red and not warm.  The distal pulses are intact.  Rectal exam shows no external nor internal hemorrhoids.  No mass is felt and no blood on the gloved finger.  Neurologically, he is alert.  He is oriented times three.  His speech is clear.  His mood appears to be good.  His short-term memory is intact.  There is no focal neurological deficit.
ASSESSMENT:
A 77-year-old gentleman with apparent widespread intra-abdominal spread of rectal cancer.  Status post bowel obstruction.  Comorbid cirrhosis with esophageal varices.  No history of bleeding.  The patient has had significant clinical and functional decline and I expect that his prognosis would be measured in weeks to months.  The patient lives alone and is currently being very well cared for his daughter from out of town.  She will be leaving in a few weeks.  There is another in-town daughter; however, she works and has a large family.
PLAN:
I will communicate with the patient's referring physician to ascertain what clinical course and data is available.  A moisture barrier will be applied to his peri-ostomy wound today and we would reassess within 24 hours.  It would be appropriate for a family meeting to be scheduled to review the family and the patient's understanding of his clinical condition and to begin to address an appropriate plan of care for the patient's inevitable decline.
I spoke with Dr. Abc, who informed me that family has in their possession a disc with the CAT scan results.  We will try to ask radiologic colleagues when we obtain the disc to give us a formal reading so that we might better understand the patient's clinical condition and better inform family of his clinical status.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?

"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 76-year-old female that was admitted with fever, chills, and left pelvic pain.  The patient was well visiting in ABC, with her daughter that evening.  She had pain in her left posterior pelvic and low back region.  They came back to XYZ the following day.  By the time they got here, she was in severe pain and had fever.  They came straight to the emergency room.  She was admitted.  She had temperature of 104 degrees F.  It has been spiking ever since and she has had left sacroiliac type hip pain.  Multiple blood studies have been done including cultures, febrile agglutinins, etc.  She has had run a higher blood glucose to the normal and she has been on sliding scale insulin.  She was not known previously to be a diabetic.  All x-rays have not been helpful as far as to determine the etiology of her discomfort.  MRIs of the lumbar spine and the pelvis and both thighs have been unremarkable for any inflammatory process.  She does have degenerative disk disease of her lumbar spine but no hip pathology.  She has swollen inguinal nodes bilaterally.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY AND REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
She was not known to be a diabetic until this admission.  She had been hypertensive.  She has been on medications and has been controlled.  She has not had hyperlipidemia.  She has had no thyroid problems.  There has been no asthma, bronchitis, TB, emphysema or pneumonia.  No tuberculosis.  She has had no breast tumors.  She has had no chest pain or cardiac problems.  She has had gallbladder surgery.  She has not had any gastritis or ulcers.  She has had no kidney disease.  She has had a hysterectomy.  She has had 9 pregnancies and 8 living children.  She had A&P repair.  She had a sacral abscess after a spinal.  It sounds to me like she had a pilonidal cyst, which took about 3 operations to heal.  There have been fractures and no significant arthritis.  She has been quite active at her ranch in Mexico.  She raises goats and cattle.  She drives a tractor and in short, has been very active.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
She is a short female, alert.  She is shivering.  She has ice in her axilla and behind her neck.  She is febrile to 101 degrees F. She is alert.  Her complaint is that of hip pain in the posterior sacroiliac joint area.  She moves both her upper extremities well.  She can move her right leg well.  She actually can move her left hip and knee without much discomfort but the pain radiates from her sacroiliac joint.  She cannot stand, sit or turn without severe pain.  She has normal knee reflexes.  No ankle reflexes.  She has bounding tibial pulses.  No sensory deficit.  She says she knows when she has to void.  She has a healed scar in the upper sacral region.  There is some bruising around the buttocks but the daughter says that is from her being in bed lying on her back.
PLAN:
My plan is to do a triple-phase bone scan.  I am suspecting an infection possibly in the left sacroiliac joint.  It is probably some type of bacterium, the etiology of which is undetermined.  She has had a normal white count despite her fever.  There has been a history of brucellosis in the past, but her titers at this time are negative.  Continue medication which included antibiotics and also the Motrin and Darvocet.
","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm feeling very uncomfortable, doctor. i have severe left pelvic pain and fever.

[patient] well, i was visiting my daughter in abc, and i had pain in my left posterior pelvic and low back region. i was brought to xyz the next day, and i was in severe pain and had fever. that's when i came to the emergency room.
[doctor] i see. do you have any other symptoms like shortness of breath or cough?
[patient] no, i don't have any of those symptoms.
[doctor] as per your medical history, have you been previously diagnosed with diabetes, hypertension, or any other medical conditions?
[patient] no, i was not previously diagnosed with diabetes, but i had hypertension. i have been on medications, which have been controlling it well.
[doctor] okay. have you ever had surgery in the past?
[patient] yes, i had gallbladder surgery and hysterectomy. i also had a pilonidal cyst, which took about three operations to heal. i had a sacral abscess after a spinal.
[doctor] alright. i'm going to conduct a physical exam to understand your condition better.
[patient] okay, doctor.
[doctor] i suspect that you may have an infection, possibly in the left sacroiliac joint. i'll be doing a triple-phase bone scan to confirm my suspicion. you should continue taking the antibiotics, motrin, and darvocet that i've prescribed earlier. keep monitoring your blood glucose levels, and i'll have the nurse adjust your sliding scale insulin accordingly.
[patient] alright, doctor.","[doctor] hey, how's it going today?

This is the initial clinic visit for a 29-year-old man who is seen for new onset of right shoulder pain.  He states that this began approximately one week ago when he was lifting stacks of cardboard.  The motion that he describes is essentially picking up a stack of cardboard at his waist level, twisting to the right and delivering it at approximately waist level.  Sometimes he has to throw the stacks a little bit as well.  He states he felt a popping sensation on 06/30/04.  Since that time, he has had persistent shoulder pain with lifting activities.  He localizes the pain to the posterior and to a lesser extent the lateral aspect of the shoulder.  He has no upper extremity .

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Focal lateral and posterior shoulder pain without a suggestion of any cervical radiculopathies.  He denies any chronic cardiac, pulmonary, GI, GU, neurologic, musculoskeletal, endocrine abnormalities.

[patient] nope, i was good. 
[doctor] perfecto! based on the amount of fluid in your band, it seems like we'll need to adjust it again in two weeks. in the meantime, i would recommend avoiding snacking at night and trying to stick to regular meals. sound good to you?

"REASON FOR VISIT:
Followup circumcision.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient had his circumcision performed on 09/16/2007 here at Children's Hospital.  The patient had a pretty significant phimosis and his operative course was smooth.  He did have a little bit of bleeding when he woke in recovery room, which required placement of some additional sutures, but after that, his recovery has been complete.  His mom did note that she had to him a couple of days of oral analgesics, but he seems to be back to normal and pain free now.  He is having no difficulty urinating, and his bowel function remains normal.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Today, The patient looks healthy and happy.  We examined his circumcision site.  His Monocryl sutures are still in place.  The healing is excellent, and there is only a mild amount of residual postoperative swelling.  There was one area where he had some recurrent adhesions at the coronal sulcus, and I gently lysed this today and applied antibiotic ointment showing this to mom had to especially lubricate this area until the healing is completed.
IMPRESSION:
Satisfactory course after circumcision for severe phimosis with no perioperative complications.
PLAN:
The patient came in followup for his routine care with Dr. X, but should not need any further routine surgical followup unless he develops any type of difficulty with this surgical wound.  If that does occur, we will be happy to see him back at any time.

I am following the patient today for immune thrombocytopenia.  Her platelets fell to 10 on 01/09/07 and shortly after learning of that result, I increased her prednisone to 60 mg a day.  Repeat on 01/16/07 revealed platelets up at 43.  No bleeding problems have been noted.  I have spoken with her hematologist who recommends at this point we decrease her prednisone to 40 mg for 3 days and then go down to 20 mg a day.  The patient had been on 20 mg every other day at least for a while, and her platelets hovered at least above 20 or so.

[doctor] i see. have you been experiencing any diarrhea or other digestive problems?
[patient] no, nothing like that.
[doctor] okay. well, based on your symptoms and medical history, i believe you may be experiencing alzheimer's dementia, b12 deficiency, osteoporosis, and hypertension. we'll need to do some further testing to confirm this, but in the meantime, i'm going to adjust your medications and recommend some lifestyle changes that may help.

"SUBJECTIVE:
I am following the patient today for multiple issues.  He once again developed gross hematuria, which was unprovoked.  His Coumadin has been held.  The patient has known BPH and is on Flomax.  He is being treated with Coumadin because of atrial fibrillation and stroke.  This is the second time he has had significant gross hematuria this month.  He also fell about a week ago and is complaining of buttock pain and leg pain.  We did get x-rays of hips, knees, and ankles.  Clearly, he has significant degenerative disease in all these areas.  No fractures noted however.  He felt that the pain is pretty severe and particularly worse in the morning.  His sinuses are bothering him.  He wonders about getting some nasal saline spray.  We talked about Coumadin, stroke risk, etc. in the setting of atrial fibrillation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Vitals:  As in chart.  The patient is alert, pleasant, and cooperative.  He is not in any apparent distress.  He is comfortable in a seated position.  I did not examine him further today.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1.  Hematuria.  Coumadin needs to be stopped, so we will evaluate what is going on, which is probably just some BPH.  We will also obtain a repeat UA as he did describe to me some dysuria.  However, I do not think this would account for the gross hematuria.  He will be started on an aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily.
2.  For the pain we will try him on Lortab.  He will get a Lortab everyday in the morning 5/500 prior to getting out of bed, and then he will have the option of having a few more throughout the day if he requires it.
3.  We will see about getting him set up with massage therapy and/or physical therapy as well for his back pain.
4.  For his sinuses, we will arrange for him to have saline nasal spray at the bedside for p.r.n. use.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm not feeling so great, doctor. i've been having some issues.
[doctor] what kind of issues are you having?
[patient] well, i had some gross hematuria again and my coumadin had to be held. i also fell about a week ago and have been experiencing some pretty severe buttock and leg pain. on top of that, my sinuses have been bothering me.
[doctor] i see. let me take a look at your chart. okay, i think we need to stop the coumadin and evaluate what's going on with the hematuria. it's probably related to your bph, but we'll also get a repeat ua to be sure. in the meantime, we'll start you on an aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily. for your pain, we'll try lortab. you can take one every morning before getting out of bed and then take more throughout the day if you need it. we'll also see about getting you set up with massage therapy or physical therapy for your back pain. and for your sinuses, we can arrange for some saline nasal spray for you to use as needed.
[patient] okay, that sounds good. thank you, doctor.
[doctor] of course. is there anything else you're concerned about?
[patient] no, i think that's it for now.
[doctor] alright, then we'll get you started on those treatments and see how you're feeling at your next appointment.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?

"SUBJECTIVE:
The patient is in complaining of headaches and dizzy spells, as well as a new little rash on the medial right calf.  She describes her dizziness as both vertigo and lightheadedness.  She does not have a headache at present but has some intermittent headaches, neck pains, and generalized myalgias.  She has noticed a few more bruises on her legs.  No fever or chills with slight cough.  She has had more chest pains but not at present.  She does have a little bit of nausea but no vomiting or diarrhea.  She complains of some left shoulder tenderness and discomfort.  She reports her blood sugar today after lunch was 155.

She is still using a triamcinolone 0.1% cream t.i.d. to her left wrist rash and her Bactroban ointment t.i.d. p.r.n. to her bug bites on her legs.  Her other meds remain as per the dictation of 07/30/2004 with the exception of her Klonopin dose being 4 mg in a.m. and 6 mg at h.s. instead of what the psychiatrist had recommended which should be 6 mg and 8 mg.
ALLERGIES:
Sulfa, erythromycin, Macrodantin, and tramadol.
OBJECTIVE:
General:  She is a well-developed, well-nourished, obese female in no acute distress.
Vital Signs:  Her age is 55.  Temperature:  98.2.  Blood pressure:  110/70.  Pulse:  72.  Weight:  174 pounds.

1.  Headaches.
2.  Dizziness.
3.  Atypical chest pains.
4.  Chronic renal failure.
5.  Type II diabetes.
6.  Myalgias.
7.  Severe anxiety (affect is still quite anxious.),PLAN:
I strongly encouraged her to increase her Klonopin to what the psychiatrist recommended, which should be 6 mg in the a.m. and 8 mg in the p.m.  I sent her to lab for CPK due to her myalgias and pro-time for monitoring her Coumadin.  Recheck in one week.  I think her dizziness is multifactorial and due to enlarged part of her anxiety.  I do note that she does have a few new bruises on her extremities, which is likely due to her Coumadin.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?

"SUBJECTIVE:
The patient is a 66-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for a five-month recheck on her type II diabetes mellitus, as well as hypertension.  While here she had a couple of other issues as well.  She stated that she has been having some right shoulder pain.  She denies any injury but certain range of motion does cause it to hurt.  No weakness, numbness or tingling.  As far as her diabetes she states that she only checks her blood sugars in the morning and those have all been ranging less than 100.  She has not been checking any two hours after meals.  Her blood pressures when she does check them have been running normal as well but she does not have any record of these present with her.  No other issues or concerns.  Upon review of her chart it did show that she had a benign breast biopsy done back on 06/11/04 and was told to have a repeat mammogram in six months but she has never had that done so she is needing to have this done as well.
ALLERGIES:
None.
MEDICATIONS:
She is on Hyzaar 50/12.5 one-half p.o. daily, coated aspirin daily, lovastatin 40 mg one-half tab p.o. daily, multivitamin daily, metformin 500 mg one tab p.o. b.i.d.; however, she has been skipping her second dose during the day.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
She is a nonsmoker.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
As noted above.
OBJECTIVE:
Vital Signs:  Temperature:  98.2.  Pulse:  64.  Respirations:  16.  Blood pressure:  110/56.  Weight:  169.

Neck:  No lymphadenopathy, thyromegaly, JVD or bruits.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation.
Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur or gallops present.
Breasts:  Exam performed with a female nurse present.  The breasts do have some scars present underneath them bilaterally from prior breast reduction surgery.  There is no axillary adenopathy or tenderness.  Breasts appear to be symmetric.  There was no nipple discharge or retraction.  No breast tissue retraction noted in either the sitting or the supine position.  Upon palpation there were no palpable lumps or bumps and no palpable discharge.
Musculoskeletal:  She did have full range of motion of her shoulders.  She did have tenderness upon palpation over the right bicipital tendon.  There is no swelling, crepitus or discoloration noted.
MEDICAL DECISION MAKING:  Most recent hemoglobin A1c was 5.6% back in October 2004.  Most recent lipid checks were obtained back in July 2004.  We have not had this checked since that time.
ASSESSMENT:
1.  Type II diabetes mellitus.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Right shoulder pain.
4.  Hyperlipidemia.
PLAN:
1.  She is going to go to lab to obtain a hemoglobin A1c, BMP, lipids, CPK, liver enzymes and quantitative microalbumin.
2.  We are going to set her up for a diagnostic bilateral mammogram due to a history of abnormal mammogram in the past which subsequently showed a benign breast cyst.
3.  I told her for her shoulder to take ibuprofen 600 mg three times daily with her meals for a minimum of the next one week.
4.  She is going to follow up in the clinic in three months for a complete comprehensive examination.  If any questions, concerns or problems arise between now and then she should let us know.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?

"CHIEF COMPLAINT:
1.  Stage IIIC endometrial cancer.
2.  Adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin, Adriamycin, and Abraxane.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 47-year-old female who was noted to have abnormal vaginal bleeding in the fall of 2009.  In March 2010, she had an abnormal endometrial ultrasound with thickening of the endometrium and an enlarged uterus.  CT scan of the abdomen on 03/22/2010 showed an enlarged uterus, thickening of the endometrium, and a mass structure in the right and left adnexa that was suspicious for ovarian metastasis.  On 04/01/2010, she had a robotic modified radical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorotomy and appendectomy with pelvic and periaortic lymphadenectomy.  The pathology was positive for grade III endometrial adenocarcinoma, 9.5 cm in size with 2 cm of invasion.  Four of 30 lymph nodes were positive for disease.  The left ovary was positive for metastatic disease.  Postsurgical PET/CT scan showed left lower pelvic side wall seroma and hypermetabolic abdominal and right pelvic retroperitoneal lymph nodes suspicious for metastatic disease.  The patient has completed five of planned six cycles of chemotherapy and comes in to clinic today for followup.  Of note, we had sent off genetic testing which was denied back in June.  I have been trying to get this testing completed.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
Synthroid q.d.
ferrous sulfate 325 mg b.i.d.
multivitamin q.d.
Ativan 0.5 mg q.4 hours p.r.n. nausea and insomnia, gabapentin one tablet at bedtime.

"SUBJECTIVE:
I am asked to see the patient today with ongoing issues around her diabetic control.  We have been fairly aggressively, downwardly adjusting her insulins, both the Lantus insulin, which we had been giving at night as well as her sliding scale Humalog insulin prior to meals.  Despite frequent decreases in her insulin regimen, she continues to have somewhat low blood glucoses, most notably in the morning when the glucoses have been in the 70s despite decreasing her Lantus insulin from around 84 units down to 60 units, which is a considerable change.  What I cannot explain is why her glucoses have not really climbed at all despite the decrease in insulin.  The staff reports to me that her appetite is good and that she is eating as well as ever.  I talked to Anna today.  She feels a little fatigued.  Otherwise, she is doing well.

[doctor] that's good to hear. your lab results show that your bun and creatinine levels are improving, which is a good sign. however, your stool test came back positive for clostridium difficile colitis. we will continue with flagyl and have an evaluation with dr. x in the morning.
[patient] okay, i understand.
[doctor] we will also continue with levaquin for your urinary tract infection, and there is a possibility that you have pneumonia, so we will continue with vancomycin and levaquin as well. your cardiac enzyme was minimally elevated on admission, so we will follow up with cardiology recommendations. lastly, we may transfer you to telemetry for further monitoring. do you have any questions?
[patient] no, i think i understand everything. thank you.

"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Hospitalist followup is required for continuing issues with atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response, which was resistant to treatment with diltiazem and amiodarone, being followed by Dr. X of cardiology through most of the day.  This afternoon, when I am seeing the patient, nursing informs me that rate has finally been controlled with esmolol, but systolic blood pressures have dropped to the 70s with a MAP of 52.  Dr. X was again consulted from the bedside.  We agreed to try fluid boluses and then to consider Neo-Synephrine pressure support if this is not successful.  In addition, over the last 24 hours, extensive discussions have been held with the family and questions answered by nursing staff concerning the patient's possible move to Tahoe Pacific or a long-term acute care.  Other issues requiring following up today are elevated transaminases, continuing fever, pneumonia, resolving adult respiratory distress syndrome, ventilatory-dependent respiratory failure, hypokalemia, non-ST-elevation MI, hypernatremia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, BPH, atrial flutter, inferior vena cava filter, and diabetes.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,VITAL SIGNS:  T-max 103.2, blood pressure at this point is running in the 70s/mid 40s with a MAP of 52, heart rate is 100.
GENERAL:  The patient is much more alert appearing than my last examination of approximately 3 weeks ago.  He denies any pain, appears to have intact mentation, and is in no apparent distress.
EYES:  Pupils round, reactive to light, anicteric with external ocular motions intact.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Reveals an irregularly irregular rhythm.
LUNGS:  Have diminished breath sounds but are clear anteriorly.
ABDOMEN:  Somewhat distended but with no guarding, rebound, or obvious tenderness to palpation.
EXTREMITIES:  Show trace edema with no clubbing or cyanosis.
NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient is moving all extremities without focal neurological deficits.
LABORATORY DATA:
Sodium 149; this is down from 151 yesterday.  Potassium 3.9, chloride 114, bicarb 25, BUN 35, creatinine 1.5 up from 1.2 yesterday, hemoglobin 12.4, hematocrit 36.3, WBC 16.5, platelets 231,000.  INR 1.4.  Transaminases are continuing to trend upwards of SGOT 546, SGPT 256.  Also noted is a scant amount of very concentrated appearing urine in the bag.
IMPRESSION:
Overall impressions continues to be critically ill 67-year-old with multiple medical problems probably still showing signs of volume depletion with hypotension and atrial flutter with difficult to control rate.
PLAN,1.  Hypotension.  I would aggressively try and fluid replete the patient giving him another liter of fluids.  If this does not work as discussed with Dr. X, we will start some Neo-Synephrine, but also continue with aggressive fluid repletion as I do think that indications are that with diminished and concentrated urine that he may still be down and fluids will still be required even if pressure support is started.
2.  Increased transaminases.  Presumably this is from increased congestion.  This is certainly concerning.  We will continue to follow this.  Ultrasound of the liver was apparently negative.
3.  Fever and elevated white count.  The patient does have a history of pneumonia and empyema.  We will continue current antibiotics per infectious disease and continue to follow the patient's white count.  He is not exceptionally toxic appearing at this time.  Indeed, he does look improved from my last examination.
4.  Ventilatory-dependent respiratory failure.  The patient has received a tracheostomy since my last examination.  Vent management per PMA.
5.  Hypokalemia.  This has resolved.  Continue supplementation.
6.  Hypernatremia.  This is improving somewhat.  I am hoping that with increased fluids this will continue to do so.
7.  Diabetes mellitus.  Fingerstick blood glucoses are reviewed and are at target.  We will continue current management.  This is a critically ill patient with multiorgan dysfunction and signs of worsening renal, hepatic, and cardiovascular function with extremely guarded prognosis.  Total critical care time spent today 37 minutes.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] not good, doctor. i'm feeling very weak.
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that. i saw in your medical records that you have been experiencing atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response. did dr. x consult with you about that?
[patient] yes, he did. the rate was controlled with esmolol, but my systolic blood pressure dropped to the 70s and my map was 52.
[doctor] i see. that is concerning. we can try fluid boluses to see if that helps, and if not, we may consider neo-synephrine pressure support. we need to watch the hypotension carefully. 
[patient] okay. 
[doctor] i also saw that you have pneumonia, respiratory distress syndrome, ventilatory-dependent respiratory failure, and elevated transaminases. we will continue the current antibiotics and follow your white blood cell count. the increased transaminases are from increased congestion. we will monitor this closely. 
[patient] alright. 
[doctor] we will also give you more fluids to help with your hypotension. 
[patient] thank you. 
[doctor] do you have any questions or concerns? 
[patient] no, doctor. 
[doctor] alright then, we will continue to monitor your condition closely. total critical care time spent today was 37 minutes.","[doctor] hi there, how's it going today?
[patient] um, not great, doc. i'm feeling really weak.
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that. i saw in your records you've been dealing with atrial flutter and rapid ventricular response. did dr. x fill you in on that?
[patient] uh-huh, yeah. they used esmolol to control the rate, but my blood pressure got low - like 70s low, and my map was 52.
[doctor] got it. that's not ideal. let's try some fluid to see if it helps, and if not, we can look at neo-synephrine pressure support. we've got to keep an eye on the hypotension.
[patient] okay, thanks.
[doctor] on top of that, it looks like you've got pneumonia, respiratory distress syndrome, ventilatory-dependent respiratory failure, and raised transaminases. we'll stick with the current antibiotics and keep an eye on your white blood cell count. the raised transaminases are from increased congestion. we'll monitor that closely.
[patient] gotcha.
[doctor] to help with the low blood pressure, we'll give you some extra fluids.
[patient] mm-hmm, thanks.
[doctor] any questions or concerns?
[patient] not right now, doc.
[doctor] alrighty, we'll keep a close eye on things. we spent 37 minutes in critical care today.",6
"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:
Management for infection of the left foot.
HISTORY:
The patient is a 26-year-old short Caucasian male who appears in excellent health, presented a week ago as he felt some pain in the ball of his left foot.  He noticed a small dark spot.  He did not remember having had any injuries to that area specifically no puncture wounds.  He had not been doing any outdoor works or activities.  No history of working outdoors, has not been to the beach or to the lake, has not been out of town.  His swelling progressed so he went to see Dr. X 4 days ago.  The area was debrided in the office and he was placed on Keflex.  It was felt that may be he had a foreign body, but nothing was found in the office and x-ray was negative for opaque foreign bodies.  His foot got worse with more swelling and at this time purulent, too red and was admitted to the hospital today, is scheduled for surgical exploration this evening.  Ancef and Cipro were prescribed today.  He denies any fever, chills, red streaks, lymphadenitis.  He had a tetanus shot in 2002 most recently.  He had childhood asthma.  He uses alcohol socially.  He works full time.  He is an electrician.

"SUBJECTIVE:
The patient comes back to see me today.  She is a pleasant 77-year-old Caucasian female who had seen Dr. XYZ with right leg pain.  She has a history of prior laminectomy for spinal stenosis.  She has seen Dr. XYZ with low back pain and lumbar scoliosis post laminectomy syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis, and clinical right L2 radiculopathy, which is symptomatic.  Dr. XYZ had performed two right L2-L3 transforaminal epidural injections, last one in March 2005.  She was subsequently seen and Dr. XYZ found most of her remaining symptoms are probably coming from her right hip.  An x-ray of the hip showed marked degenerative changes with significant progression of disease compared to 08/04/2004 study.  Dr. XYZ had performed right intraarticular hip injection on 04/07/2005.  She was last seen on 04/15/2005.  At that time, she had the hip injection that helped her briefly with her pain.  She is not sure whether or not she wants to proceed with hip replacement.  We recommend she start using a cane and had continued her on some pain medicines.
The patient comes back to see me today.  She continues to complain of significant pain in her right hip, especially with weightbearing or with movement.  She said she had made an appointment to see an orthopedic surgeon in Newton as it is closer and more convenient for her.  She is taking Ultracet or other the generic it sounds like, up to four times daily.  She states she can take this much more frequently as she still has significant pain symptoms.  She is using a cane to help her ambulate.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Essentially unchanged from her visit of 04/15/2005.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
General:  Reveals a pleasant Caucasian female.
Vital Signs:  Height is 5 feet 4 inches.  Weight is 149 pounds.  She is afebrile.
HEENT:  Benign.
Neck:  Shows functional range of movements with a negative Spurling's.
Musculoskeletal:  Examination shows some mild degenerative joint disease of both knees with grade weakness of her right hip flexors and half-grade weakness of her right hip adductors and right quadriceps, as compared to the left.  Straight leg raises are negative bilaterally.  Posterior tibials are palpable bilaterally.
Skin and Lymphatics:  Examination of the skin does not reveal any additional scars, rashes, cafe au lait spots or ulcers.  No significant lymphadenopathy noted.
Spine:  Examination shows lumbar scoliosis with surgical scar with no major tenderness.  Spinal movements are limited but functional.
Neurological:  She is alert and oriented with appropriate mood and affect.  She has normal tone and coordination.  Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical.  Sensations are intact to pinprick.
FUNCTIONAL EXAMINATION:
Gait has a normal stance and swing phase with no antalgic component to it.

1.  Degenerative disk disease of the right hip, symptomatic.
2.  Low back syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis, clinically right L2 radiculopathy, stable.
3.  Low back pain with lumbar scoliosis post laminectomy syndrome, stable.
4.  Facet and sacroiliac joint syndrome on the right, stable.
5.  Post left hip arthroplasty.
6.  Chronic pain syndrome.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
The patient is symptomatic primarily on her right hip and is planning on seeing an orthopedic surgeon for possible right hip replacement.  In the interim, her Ultracet is not quite taking care of her pain.  I have asked her to discontinue it and we will start her on Tylenol #3, up to four times a day.  I have written a prescription for this for 120 tablets and two refills.  The patient will call for the refills when she needs them.  I will plan further follow up in six months, sooner if needed.  She voiced understanding and is in agreement with this plan.  Physical exam findings, history of present illness and recommendations were performed with and in agreement with Dr. Goel's findings.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, i am not feeling great, my right hip is causing me a lot of pain.
[doctor] okay, let me take a look at your medical notes. i see that you have a history of prior laminectomy for spinal stenosis and have seen dr. xyz with low back pain and lumbar scoliosis post laminectomy syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis, and clinical right l2 radiculopathy, which is symptomatic. dr. xyz had performed two right l2-l3 transforaminal epidural injections, last one in march 2005. is that correct?
[patient] yes, that's right.
[doctor] and you were also seen for your hip pain and dr. xyz had performed right intraarticular hip injection on 04/07/2005. she was last seen on 04/15/2005. at that time, she had the hip injection that helped her briefly with her pain. is that correct?
[patient] yes, that's right.
[doctor] i can see that you have been taking ultracet for your pain, but it's not quite taking care of it. i will prescribe tylenol #3 for you, up to four times a day. you can call for the refills when you need them. i would also recommend that you start using a cane to help you ambulate. have you seen an orthopedic surgeon yet for your hip pain?
[patient] yes, i have made an appointment to see an orthopedic surgeon in newton as it is closer and more convenient for me.

"SUBJECTIVE:
The patient comes back to see me today.  She is a pleasant 73-year-old Caucasian female who had seen Dr. XYZ with low back pain, lumbar degenerative disc disease, lumbar spondylosis, facet and sacroiliac joint syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis primarily bilateral recess, intermittent lower extremity radiculopathy, DJD of both knees, bilateral pes anserinus bursitis, and chronic pain syndrome.  Dr. XYZ had performed right and left facet and sacroiliac joint injections, subsequent right L3 to S1 medial branch blocks and radiofrequency ablation on the right from L3 to S1.  She was subsequently seen with some mid back pain and she had right T8-T9 and T9-T10 facet injections on 10/28/2004.  She was last seen on 04/08/2005 with recurrent pain in her low back on the right.  Dr. XYZ repeated her radiofrequency ablation on the right side from L3-S1 on 05/04/2005.
The patient comes back to see me today.  She states that the radiofrequency ablation has helped her significantly there, but she still has one spot in her low back that seems to be hurting her on the right, and seems to be pointing to her right sacroiliac joint.  She is also complaining of pain in both knees.  She says that 20 years ago she had a cortisone shot in her knees, which helped her significantly.  She has not had any x-rays for quite some time.  She is taking some Lortab 7.5 mg tablets, up to four daily, which help her with her pain symptoms.  She is also taking Celebrex through Dr. S’ office.

8.  Degenerative disc disease of both knees, symptomatic.
9.  Pes anserinus bursitis, bilaterally symptomatic.
10.  Chronic pain syndrome.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Dr. XYZ and I discussed with the patient her pathology.  She has some symptoms in her low back on the right side at the sacroiliac joint.  Dr. XYZ will plan having her come in and injecting her right sacroiliac joint under fluoroscopy.  She is also having pain in both knees.  We will plan on x-rays of both knees, AP and lateral, and plan on seeing her back on Monday or Friday for possible intraarticular and/or pes anserine bursa injections bilaterally.  I explained the rationale for each of these injections, possible complications and she wishes to proceed.  In the interim, she can continue on Lortab and Celebrex.  We will plan for the follow up following these interventions, sooner if needed.  She voiced understanding and agreement.  Physical exam findings, history of present illness, and recommendations were performed with and in agreement with Dr. Goel's findings.","[doctor]: hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient]: i am not doing well, doctor. i am still having pain in my low back and both knees.
[doctor]: i see. let me check your medical history. as per your medical record, you have had radiofrequency ablation for your low back pain, which has helped to some extent. you also have degenerative disc disease in both knees and pes anserinus bursitis, which is causing the pain. dr. xyz has recommended knee x-rays and sacroiliac joint injection. is that right?
[patient]: yes, that's correct. i am taking lortab and celebrex, which are providing some relief.
[doctor]: alright. let me examine you. i will check your low back and both knees for any tenderness or swelling. [after physical examination] i can see that you have some pain in your right sacroiliac joint, and both your knees are tender with pes anserinus bursitis. i suggest you go for sacroiliac joint injection and knee x-rays.
[patient]: okay, can you explain the procedure and possible complications?
[doctor]: sure, the sacroiliac joint injection is done under fluoroscopy, and it helps in reducing pain and inflammation. there are minimal risks involved, such as bleeding, infection, or nerve damage, but they are rare. knee x-rays will help us in identifying the exact cause of your pain. and for your knees, we can also do intraarticular and/or pes anserine bursa injections bilaterally. if needed, we can plan for follow-up procedures. do you have any questions?
[patient]: no, doctor. i understand everything. thank you for explaining it to me.
[doctor]: you're welcome. i have prescribed you medication for pain relief, and you can continue with them until we have the next follow-up. let me know if you face any issues or side effects.

"CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Right middle finger triggering and locking, as well as right index finger soreness at the PIP joint.
HISTORY OF OCCUPATIONAL INJURY OR ILLNESS:
The patient has been followed elsewhere, and we reviewed his records.  Essentially, he has had a trigger finger and a mucocyst, and he has had injections.  This has been going on for several months.  He is now here for active treatment because the injections were not helpful, nonoperative treatment has not worked, and he would like to move forward in order to prevent this from keeping on locking and causing his pain.  He is referred over here for evaluation regarding that.
SIGNIFICANT PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY:
General health/review of systems:  See H&P.
Allergies:  See H&P.
Medications:  See H&P.
Social History:  See H&P.
Family History:  See H&P.
Previous Hospitalizations:  See H&P.
CLINICAL ASSESSMENT AND FINDINGS:
Musculoskeletal:  Shows point tenderness to palpation to the right middle finger A1 pulley.  The right index finger has some small soreness at the PIP joint, but at this time no obvious mucocyst.  He has flexion/extension of his fingers intact.  There is no crepitation at the wrist, forearm, elbow or shoulder with full range of motion.  Contralateral arm exam for comparison reveals no focal findings.
Neurological:  APB, EPL and first dorsal interosseous 5/5.
LABORATORY, RADIOGRAPHIC, AND/OR IMAGING TESTS ORDERS & RESULTS:
Special lab studies:
CLINICAL IMPRESSION:
1.  Tendinitis, left middle finger.
2.  PIP joint synovitis and mucocyst, but controlled on nonoperative treatment.
3.  Middle finger trigger, failed nonoperative treatment, requiring a trigger finger release to the right middle finger.
EVALUATION/TREATMENT PLAN:
Risks, benefits and alternatives were discussed.  All questions were answered.  No guarantees were made.  We will schedule for surgery.  We would like to move forward in order to help him significantly improve since he has failed injections.  All questions were answered.  Followup appointment was given.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?
[patient] hi, i'm doing okay, thanks.
[doctor] good to hear. so, i took a look at your records and it looks like you've been dealing with some finger issues for several months now. can you tell me a bit more about what's been going on?
[patient] yeah, my right middle finger has been triggering and locking, and my right index finger has been sore at the pip joint.
[doctor] i see. and you've had injections in the past for this, but they didn't help?
[patient] no, unfortunately not.
[doctor] okay, well we'll take a closer look and see what we can do to help. so, i did a physical exam and found some tenderness in your right middle finger a1 pulley, and some small soreness in your right index finger. your finger flexion and extension seem to be intact, which is good. i didn't find any other issues in the rest of your arm. 
[patient] okay.
[doctor] based on what i'm seeing, it looks like you have tendinitis in your left middle finger, pip joint synovitis and mucocyst, which is controlled on nonoperative treatment, and a middle finger trigger that has failed nonoperative treatment and will require a trigger finger release to the right middle finger.

"PAST MEDICAL CONDITION:
None.
ALLERGIES:
None.
CURRENT MEDICATION:
Zyrtec and hydrocodone 7.5 mg one every 4 to 6 hours p.r.n. for pain.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Back injury with RLE radicular symptoms.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 52-year-old male who is here for independent medical evaluation.  The patient states that he works for ABC ABC as a temporary worker.  He worked for ABCD too.  The patient's main job was loading and unloading furniture and appliances for the home.  The patient was approximately there for about two and a half weeks.  Date of injury occurred back in October.  The patient stating that he had history of previous back problems ongoing; however, he states that on this particular day back in October, he was unloading an 18-wheeler at ABC and he was bending down picking up boxes to unload and load.  Unfortunately at this particular event, the patient had sharp pain in his lower back.  Soon afterwards, he had radiating symptoms down his right buttock all the way down to the lateral part of his leg crossing his knee.  This became progressively worse.  He also states that some of his radiating pain went down to his left leg as well.  He noticed increase in buttock spasm and also noticed spasm in his buttocks.  He initially saw Dr. Z and was provided with some muscle relaxer and was given some pain patches or Lidoderm patch, I believe.  The patient states that after this treatment, his symptoms still persisted.  At this point, the patient later on was referred to Dr. XYZ through the workmen's comp and he was initially evaluated back in April.  After the evaluation, the patient was sent for MRI, was provided with pain medications such as short-acting opioids.  He was put on restricted duty.  The MRI essentially came back negative, but the patient continued to have radiating symptoms down to his lower extremity and subsequently the patient was essentially released by Dr. XYZ in June with maximum medical improvement.
Unfortunately, the patient continued to have persistence of back pain and radiating symptoms down to his leg and went back to see Dr. XYZ again, and at this point, the patient was provided with further medication management and sent for Pain Clinic referral.  The patient also was recommended for nerve block at this point and the patient received epidural steroid injection by Dr. ABC without any significant relief.  The patient also was sent for EMG and nerve conduction study, which was performed by Dr. ABCD and the MRI, EMG, and nerve conduction study came back essentially negative for radiculopathy, which was performed by Dr. ABCD.  The patient states that he continues to have pain with extended sitting, he has radiating symptoms down to his lower extremity on the right side of his leg, increase in pain with stooping.  He has difficulty sleeping at nighttime because of increase in pain.  Ultimately, the patient was returned back to work in June, and deemed with maximum medical improvement back in June.  The patient unfortunately still has significant degree of back pain with activities such as stooping and radicular symptoms down his right leg, worse than the left side.  The patient also went to see Dr. X who is a chiropractic specialist and received eight or nine visits of chiropractic care without long-term relief in his overall radicular symptoms.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
The patient was examined with the gown on.  Lumbar flexion was moderately decreased.  Extension was normal.  Side bending to the right was decreased.  Side bending to the left was within normal limits.  Rotation and extension to the right side was causing increasing pain.  Extension and side bending to the left was within normal limits without significant pain on the left side.  While seated, straight leg was negative on the LLE at 90° and also negative on the RLE at 90°.  There was no true root tension sign or radicular symptoms upon straight leg raising in the seated position.  In supine position, straight leg was negative in the LLE and also negative on the RLE.  Sensory exam shows there was a decrease in sensation to the S1 dermatomal distribution on the right side to light touch and at all other dermatomal distribution was within normal limits.  Deep tendon reflex at the patella was 2+/4 bilaterally, but there was a decrease in reflex in the Achilles tendon 1+/4 on the right side and essentially 2+/4 on the left side.  Medial hamstring reflex was 2+/4 on both hamstrings as well.  On prone position, there was tightness in the paraspinals and erector spinae muscle as well as tightness on the right side of the quadratus lumborum area, right side was worse than the left side.  Increase in pain at deep palpatory examination in midline of the L5 and S1 level.
MEDICAL RECORD REVIEW:
I had the opportunity to review Dr. XYZ's medical records.  Also reviewed Dr. ABC procedural note, which was the epidural steroid injection block that was performed in December.  Also, reviewed Dr. X's medical record notes and an EMG and nerve study that was performed by Dr. ABCD, which was essentially normal.  The MRI of the lumbar spine that was performed back in April, which showed no evidence of herniated disc.
DIAGNOSIS:
Residual from low back injury with right lumbar radicular symptomatology.
EVALUATION/RECOMMENDATION:
The patient has an impairment based on AMA Guides Fifth Edition and it is permanent.  The patient appears to have re-aggravation of the low back injury back in October related to his work at ABC when he was working unloading and loading an 18-wheel truck.  Essentially, there was a clear aggravation of his symptoms with ongoing radicular symptom down to his lower extremity mainly on the right side more so than the left.  The patient also has increase in back pain with lumbar flexion and rotational movement to the right side.  With these ongoing symptoms, the patient has also decrease in activities of daily living such as mobility as well as decrease in sleep pattern and general decrease in overall function.  Therefore, the patient is assigned 8% impairment of the whole person.  We are able to assign this utilizing the Fifth Edition on spine section on the AMA guide.  Using page 384, table 15-3, the patient does fall under DRE Lumbar Category II under criteria for rating impairment due to lumbar spine injury.  In this particular section, it states that the patient's clinical history and examination findings are compatible with specific injury; and finding may include significant muscle guarding or spasm observed at the time of examination, a symmetric loss of range of motion, or non-verifiable radicular complaints define his complaints of radicular pain without objective findings; no alteration of the structural integrity and no significant radiculopathy.  The patient also has decrease in activities of daily living; therefore, the patient is assigned at the higher impairment rating of 8% WPI.  In the future, the patient should avoid prolonged walking, standing, stooping, squatting, hip bending, climbing, excessive flexion, extension, and rotation of his back.  His one time weight limit should be determined by work trial, although the patient should continue to be closely monitored and managed for his pain control by the specific specialist for management of his overall pain.  The patient although has a clear low back pain with certain movements such as stooping and extended sitting and does have a clear radicular symptomatology, the patient also should be monitored closely for specific dependency to short-acting opioids in the near future by specialist who could monitor and closely follow his overall pain management.  The patient also should be treated with appropriate modalities and appropriate rehabilitation in the near future.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Vital signs are normal.  Pupils are equal and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are intact.  There is no nystagmus.  Visual fields are full.  Demeanor is normal.  Facial sensation and symmetry is normal.  No myoclonic jerks noted during this examination.  No myoclonic jerks provoked by tapping on her upper extremity muscles.  Negative orbit.  Deep tendon reflexes are 2 and symmetric.  Gait is normal.  Tandem gait is normal.  Romberg negative.
IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
Recurrence of early morning myoclonus despite high levels of Lamictal.  She is tolerating the medication well and has not had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure.  She is concerned that this is a precursor for another generalized seizure.  She states that she is compliant with her medications and has had a normal sleep-wake cycle.
Looking back through her notes, she initially responded very well to Keppra, but did have a breakthrough seizure on Keppra.  This was thought secondary to severe insomnia when her baby was very young.  Because she tolerated the medication well and it was at least partially affective, I have recommended adding Keppra 500 mg b.i.d.  Side effect profile of this medication was discussed with the patient.
I will see in followup in three months.","[doctor] hi, it's good to see you again. how have you been feeling since our last visit?
[patient] hi, doctor. i've been doing okay, but i have been having some myoclonus jerking lately, mostly in the mornings.
[doctor] i see, and have you had any generalized seizures since our last visit?
[patient] no, i haven't had any of those.
[doctor] okay, that's good to know. i understand that you're concerned about having another seizure, but we'll do our best to prevent that from happening. so, you've been taking your medications as prescribed?
[patient] yes, i have been very compliant with them, and i'm also getting good sleep.
[doctor] that's great to hear. i reviewed your recent eeg, and it did show polyspike and slow wave complexes bilaterally, more prominent on the left. based on your history and exam, it seems like you're having a recurrence of early morning myoclonus despite taking high levels of lamictal. looking back through your notes, you initially responded well to keppra but had a breakthrough seizure on it. do you remember that?
[patient] yes, i do remember that.
[doctor] since you tolerated keppra well and it was at least partially effective, i recommend adding keppra 500 mg b.i.d. we discussed the side effect profile of this medication, and i will see you in follow-up in three months. in the meantime, continue taking your medications as prescribed and let me know if there are any issues or concerns.","[doctor] hi, it's good to see you again. how have you been feeling since our last visit?

"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 43-year-old male who was recently discharged from our care on the 1/13/06 when he presented for shortness of breath. He has a past history of known hyperthyroidism since 1992 and a more recent history of atrial fibrillation and congestive cardiac failure with an ejection fraction of 20%-25%. The main cause for his shortness of breath was believed to be due to atrial fibrillation secondary to hyperthyroidism in a setting with congestive cardiac failure. During his hospital stay, he was commenced on metoprolol for rate control, and given that he had atrial fibrillation, he was also started on warfarin, which his INR has been followed up by the Homeless Clinic. For his congestive cardiac failure, he was restarted on Digoxin and lisinopril. For his hyperthyroidism, we restarted him on PTU and the endocrinologists were happy to review him when he was euthymic to discuss further radioiodine or radiotherapy. He was restarted on PTU and discharged from the hospital on this medication. While in the hospital, it was also noted that he abused cigarettes and cocaine, and we advised strongly against this given the condition of his heart. It was also noted that he had elevated liver function tests, which an ultrasound was normal, but his hepatitis panel was pending. Since his discharge, his hepatitis panel has come back normal for hepatitis A, B, and C. Since discharge, the patient has complained of shortness of breath, mainly at night when lying flat, but otherwise he states he has been well and compliant with his medication.
MEDICATIONS:
Digoxin 250 mcg daily, lisinopril 5 mg daily, metoprolol 50 mg twice daily, PTU (propylthiouracil) 300 mg orally four times a day, warfarin variable dose based on INR.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS: He was afebrile today. Blood pressure 114/98. Pulse 92 but irregular. Respiratory rate 25.
HEENT: Obvious exophthalmus, but no obvious lid lag today.
NECK: There was no thyroid mass palpable.
CHEST: Clear except for occasional bibasilar crackles.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Heart sounds were dual, but irregular, with no additional sounds.
ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, nondistended.
EXTREMITIES: Mild +1 peripheral edema in both legs.
PLAN:
The patient has also been attending the Homeless Clinic since discharge from the hospital, where he has been receiving quality care and they have been looking after every aspect of his health, including his hyperthyroidism. It is our recommendation that a TSH and T4 be continually checked until the patient is euthymic, at which time he should attend endocrine review with Dr. Huffman for further treatment of his hyperthyroidism. Regarding his atrial fibrillation, he is moderately rate controlled with metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d. His rate in clinic today was 92. He could benefit from increasing his metoprolol dose, however, in the hospital it was noted that he was bradycardic in the morning with a pulse rate down to the 50s, and we were concerned with making this patient bradycardic in the setting of congestive cardiac failure. Regarding his congestive cardiac failure, he currently appears stable, with some variation in his weight. He states he has been taking his wife's Lasix tablets for diuretic benefit when he feels weight gain coming on and increased edema. We should consider adding him on a low-dose furosemide tablet to be taken either daily or when his weight is above his target range. A Digoxin level has not been repeated since discharge, and we feel that this should be followed up. We have also increased his lisinopril to 5 mg daily, but the patient did not receive his script upon departing our clinic. Regarding his elevated liver function tests, we feel that these are very likely secondary to hepatic congestion secondary to congestive cardiac failure with a normal ultrasound and normal hepatitis panel, but yet the liver function tests should be followed up.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm feeling okay, thanks for asking.
[doctor] good to hear that. i was just going through your medical notes and noticed that you were recently discharged from the hospital. can you tell me how you've been feeling since then?

[patient] i've been taking them regularly as prescribed.
[doctor] that's good to know. your ptu medication is for your hyperthyroidism, which you've had since 1992. we'll need to monitor your tsh and t4 levels until you become euthyroid. then you can see dr. huffman for further treatment. how has your atrial fibrillation been?
[patient] i've been taking metoprolol for rate control, and my inr levels are being monitored by the homeless clinic.
[doctor] great. you could benefit from an increase in your metoprolol dosage but we need to be cautious about lowering your heart rate in the setting of congestive cardiac failure. how has your heart failure been?
[patient] it's been stable except for some variation in my weight. sometimes i take my wife's lasix tablets for diuretic benefits.
[doctor] alright. we should consider adding a low-dose furosemide tablet to your medication. we need to follow up on your digoxin level and liver function tests as well. we increased your lisinopril to 5 mg daily, but we need to make sure you receive the prescription. does that sound good?

"HISTORY:
This is an initial visit for this 95-year-old gentleman with a Hospice diagnosis of CHF.  He was referred to us by Dr. ABC, who reveals a long history of cardiomyopathy and a recent decrease in his ejection fraction to approximately 20-25%.  The patient was seen in the office approximately three days ago with a clinical diagnosis of bronchitis.  The FES, as well as the daughter report that he has had significant clinical and functional decline over the last two to three weeks.  He is no longer ambulatory.  His appetite is significantly decreased and he had significant unmeasured weight loss.  He is notably more weak.  He is unable to perform any of the activities of daily living and he is increasingly somnolent with poor sleep at night.  The patient says that he is ready to die, that he is after all 95 years old and is aware that his clinical and functional status has been declining.  He worked as a chef for almost seven decades and retired approximately two years ago.  He denies pain.  He admits to some cough, but he believes the cough is improved on the current antibiotic.  He does note that he sleeps poorly and unable to indicate a cause for that difficulty in sleeping.  He reports that he recently made a trip to California where he said goodbye to his children that live there.  The patient reports that his goals of care are to stay at home.  He has never been hospitalized with the exception of some surgery on his back in Houston, Texas decades ago that he has no interest in going to a hospital and that he would be happy to sign a DNR form and that he would like no heroics performed in the event that his heart or breathing stops.  He denies anxiety or depression and feels that his life has been quite full and quite successful and that when time comes, he is ready to go.
MEDICATIONS:
His medications include Avelox 400 mg.  He is on day four of a seven-day dose.  He is on Coreg 3.125 mg a day, lisinopril 5 mg a day, Coumadin 2.5 mg a day, digoxin 0.125 mg every other day, Lasix 80 mg twice daily, Inspra twice daily, and he is on a transdermal nitro patch 12 hours on and 12 hours off.  He takes Tylenol extra strength every four to six hours for bilateral shoulder pain typically one to two doses a day.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Exam reveals a cachectic somnolent gentleman, who appears to be comfortable.  His blood pressure is 90/60.  His heart rate is 80 and irregular.  His respiratory rate is 14.  Head reveals marked temporal wasting.  He is anicteric.  The pupils are equal and round.  There is jugular venous distention noted approximately 2-3 cm above the notch.  Chest shows good air entry bilaterally with scattered rhonchi.  No audible wheezing.  His heart sounds are irregular and there is a musical systolic ejection murmur radiating to the axilla.  The abdomen is soft with a large midline well-healed surgical scar.  The bowel sounds are normoactive.  There is no tenderness or palpable organomegaly.  He has 2+ edema of his lower extremities with some weeping of the right lower extremity and no evidence of infection.  Neurologically, while somnolent easily aroused and speech is quite clear.  He identities the date as October of 2008, but is otherwise oriented.  His short-term memory is quite poor.  His insight is also poor.  He appears to be somewhat sad.  There are mild regular tremors, right hand worse than left, but there is otherwise no focal neurological deficit.
A phone conversation with his daughter, Xyz, his health care proxy, ensued.  His daughter is very concerned with his clinical decline and is raising the question of whether he would benefit from hospitalization.  She reports that her mother died after a many-year course with heart failure and had upwards of three dozen hospitalizations.  At each hospitalization, she seem to derive benefit and wondered if her dad would drive equal benefit from hospitalizations.  She is aware that he is unwilling to be hospitalized and I believe hopefully that the Hospice team might persuade him.  She also reports that he has been talking about dying for nearly five years.
ASSESSMENT:
A 95-year-old gentleman with endstage CHF with recent significant clinical and functional decline.  The patient appears to have relatively little in the way of symptoms, although perhaps some sleep hygiene might be of help.  While today the patient appears to be very calm and sedated, the history is one of significant emotional lability.  Family is having great difficulty accepting the terminality of the patient's circumstances.
PLAN:
A DNR was placed in the house after the above-noted conversation was had.  I believe the patient might benefit from low-dose hypnotic and 7.5 mg of Restoril was ordered.  Reassessment of the patient's condition is warranted.  A family meeting will be offered to review the circumstances of the patient's condition in hopes that family might better accept his wishes and to develop a plan of care for this gentleman.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm feeling okay, thank you.
[doctor] i understand that you've been experiencing significant decline lately. how have you been sleeping?
[patient] i've been sleeping poorly.
[doctor] i see. have you been experiencing any pain or discomfort lately?

[patient] uh, no, i haven't had any pain.
[doctor] okay. i also see that you have a history of heart problems. how has that been affecting you lately?
[patient] hmm, i don't feel great, but i've had heart problems for a long time.
[doctor] i understand. i see that you've expressed your wishes about your care. can you tell me more about that?
[patient] yeah, i want to stay at home and not be hospitalized. i'm ready to go when the time comes.
[doctor] i understand. i will make sure to respect your wishes. i will also prescribe a low-dose hypnotic to help with your sleep.
[patient] thank you.
[doctor] would you be willing to have a family meeting to discuss your condition and make a plan of care?
[patient] oh, yeah, that sounds like a good idea.
[doctor] okay. thank you for your time. we will be in touch soon.",6
"SUBJECTIVE:
This 68-year-old man presents to the emergency department for three days of cough, claims that he has brought up some green and grayish sputum.  He says he does not feel short of breath.  He denies any fever or chills.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
HEENT:  Denies any severe headache or sore throat.
CHEST:  No true pain.
GI:  No nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
PAST HISTORY:
He states that he is on Coumadin because he had a cardioversion done two months ago for atrial fibrillation.  He also lists some other medications.  I do have his medications list.  He is on Pacerone, Zaroxolyn, albuterol inhaler, Neurontin, Lasix, and several other medicines.  Those are the predominant medicines.  He is not a diabetic.  The past history otherwise, he has had smoking history, but he quit several years ago and denies any COPD or emphysema.  No one else in the family is sick.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL:  The patient appears comfortable.  He did not appear to be in any respiratory distress.  He was alert.  I heard him cough once during the entire encounter.  He did not bring up any sputum at that time.
VITAL SIGNS:  His temperature is 98, pulse 71, respiratory rate 18, blood pressure 122/57, and pulse ox is 95% on room air.
HEENT:  Throat was normal.
RESPIRATORY:  He was breathing normally.  There was clear and equal breath sounds.  He was speaking in full sentences.  There was no accessory muscle use.
HEART:  Sounded regular.
SKIN:  Normal color, warm and dry.
NEUROLOGIC:  Neurologically he was alert.
IMPRESSION:
Viral syndrome, which we have been seeing in many cases throughout the week.  The patient asked me about antibiotics and I did not see a need to do this since he did not appear to have an infection other than viral given his normal temperature, normal pulse, normal respiratory rate, and near normal oxygen.  The patient being on Coumadin I explained to him that unless there was a solid reason to put him on antibiotics, he would be advised not to do so because antibiotics can alter the gut floor causing the INR to increase while on Coumadin which may cause serious bleeding.  The patient understands this.  I then asked him if the cough was annoying him, he said it was.  I offered him a cough syrup, which he agreed to take.  The patient was then discharged with Tussionex Pennkinetic a hydrocodone time-release cough syrup.  I told to check in three days, if the symptoms were not getting better.  The patient appeared to be content with this treatment and was discharged in approximately 30 to 45 minutes later.  His wife calls me very angry that I did not give him antibiotics.  I explained her exactly what I explained to him that they were not indicative at this time, and she became very upset saying that they came there specifically for antibiotics and I explained again that antibiotics are not indicated for viral infection and that I did not think he had a bacterial infection.
DIAGNOSIS:
Viral respiratory illness.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?
[patient] hi doctor, i'm not feeling too well. i've been coughing up some green and grayish sputum for the past three days.
[doctor] i see. have you been experiencing shortness of breath?
[patient] no, i haven't had any trouble breathing. but the cough is really bothering me.
[doctor] i understand. have you had any fever or chills?
[patient] no, i haven't had either of those.
[doctor] alright. based on your symptoms, it sounds like you may have a viral respiratory illness. i'm going to prescribe you a cough syrup that should help with your cough. however, i don't think antibiotics are necessary at this time, as it doesn't seem like you have a bacterial infection. it's also important to note that since you're on coumadin, taking antibiotics without a solid reason could cause serious bleeding.
[patient] i see. thank you for explaining that to me.
[doctor] of course. if your symptoms don't improve in three days, please come back in for a follow-up appointment.","[doctor] hey there, how are you feeling today?

"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a charming and delightful 46-year-old woman admitted with palpitations and presyncope.
The patient is active and a previously healthy young woman, who has had nine years of occasional palpitations.  Symptoms occur three to four times per year and follow no identifiable pattern.  She has put thought and effort in trying to identify precipitating factors or circumstances but has been unable to do so.  Symptoms can last for an hour or more and she feels as if her heart is going very rapidly but has never measured her heart rate.  The last two episodes, the most recent of which was yesterday, were associated with feeling of darkness descending as if a shade was being pulled down in front of her vision.  On neither occasion did she lose consciousness.
Yesterday, she had a modestly active morning taking a walk with her dogs and performing her normal routines.  While working on a computer, she had a spell.  Palpitations persisted for a short time thereafter as outlined in the hospital's admission note prompting her to seek evaluation at the hospital.  She was in sinus rhythm on arrival and has been asymptomatic since.
No history of exogenous substance abuse, alcohol abuse, or caffeine abuse.  She does have a couple of sodas and at least one to two coffees daily.  She is a nonsmoker.  She is a mother of two.  There is no family history of congenital heart disease.  She has had no history of thoracic trauma.  No symptoms to suggest thyroid disease.
No known history of diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia.  Family history is negative for ischemic heart disease.
Remote history is significant for an ACL repair, complicated by contact urticaria from a neoprene cast.
No regular medications prior to admission.
The only allergy is the neoprene reaction outlined above.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Vital signs as charted.  Pupils are reactive.  Sclerae nonicteric.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Neck veins not distended.  No bruits.  Lungs are clear.  Cardiac exam is regular without murmurs, gallops, or rubs.  Abdomen is soft without guarding, rebound masses, or bruits.  Extremities well perfused.  No edema.  Strong and symmetrical distal pulses.
A 12-lead EKG shows sinus rhythm with normal axis and intervals.  No evidence of preexcitation.
LABORATORY STUDIES:
Unremarkable.  No evidence of myocardial injury.  Thyroid function is pending.
Two-dimensional echocardiogram shows no evidence of clinically significant structural or functional heart disease.
IMPRESSION/PLAN:
Episodic palpitations over a nine-year period.  Outpatient workup would be appropriate.  Event recorder should be obtained and the patient can be seen again in the office upon completion of that study.  Suppressive medication (beta-blocker or Cardizem) was discussed with the patient for symptomatic improvement, though this would be unlikely to be a curative therapy.  The patient expresses a preference to avoid medical therapy if possible.
Thank you for this consultation.  We will be happy to follow her both during this hospitalization and following discharge.  Caffeine avoidance was discussed as well.
ADDENDUM:
During her initial evaluation, a D-dimer was mildly elevated to 5.  CT scan showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus.  Lower extremity venous ultrasound is pending; however, in the absence of embolization to the pulmonary vasculature, this would be an unlikely cause of palpitations.  In addition, no progression over the nine-year period that she has been symptomatic suggests that this is an unlikely cause.
","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, i'm doing alright. a little worried about my palpitations though.
[doctor] i understand. can you tell me a bit more about your symptoms and how long you've been experiencing them?
[patient] sure. i've been having occasional palpitations for about nine years now. they happen three to four times a year and last for about an hour or more. i've never been able to identify any triggers for them. the last two episodes, including the one yesterday, were also associated with a feeling of darkness descending in front of my vision.
[doctor] okay, and did you measure your heart rate during these episodes?
[patient] no, i never have.
[doctor] i see. have you experienced any other symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness?
[patient] no, just the palpitations and the visual disturbance.
[doctor] alright. i've taken a look at your ekg and echocardiogram results, and they both look normal. however, i would still recommend an outpatient workup and obtaining an event recorder to monitor your heart rhythm during these episodes.
[patient] okay, that sounds like a good idea.
[doctor] additionally, we can discuss medications such as beta-blockers or cardizem to help manage your symptoms, but it's unlikely to be a cure.
[patient] i'd prefer to avoid medication if possible.
[doctor] i understand. we can also recommend avoiding caffeine and follow up with you both during your hospital stay and after discharge.

"CHIEF COMPLAINT:
The patient comes for bladder instillation for chronic interstitial cystitis.
SUBJECTIVE:
The patient is crying today when she arrives in the office saying that she has a lot of discomfort.  These bladder instillations do not seem to be helping her.  She feels anxious and worried.  She does not think she can take any more pain.  She is debating whether or not to go back to Dr. XYZ and ask for the nerve block or some treatment modality to stop the pain because she just cannot function on a daily basis and care for her children unless she gets something done about this, and she fears these bladder instillations because they do not seem to help.  They seem to be intensifying her pain.  She has the extra burden of each time she comes needing to have pain medication one way or another, thus then we would not allow her to drive under the influence of the pain medicine.  So, she has to have somebody come with her and that is kind of troublesome to her.  We discussed this at length.  I did suggest that it was completely appropriate for her to decide.  She will terminate these if they are that uncomfortable and do not seem to be giving her any relief, although I did tell her that occasionally people do have discomfort with them and then after the completion of the instillations, they do better and we have also had some people who have had to terminate the instillations because they were too uncomfortable and they could not stand it and they went on to have some other treatment modality.  She had Hysterectomy in the past.
MEDICATIONS:
Premarin 1.25 mg daily, Elmiron 100 mg t.i.d.
Elavil 50 mg at bedtime, OxyContin 10 mg three tablets three times a day, Toprol XL 25 mg daily.
ALLERGIES:
Compazine and Allegra.
OBJECTIVE:
Vital Signs:  Weight:  140 pounds.  Blood pressure:  132/90.  Pulse:  102.  Respirations:  18.  Age:  27.
PLAN:
We discussed going for another evaluation by Dr. XYZ and seeking his opinion.  She said that she called him on the phone the other day and told him how miserable she was and he told her that he really thought she needed to complete.  The instillations give that a full trial and then he would be willing to see her back.  As we discussed these options and she was encouraged to think it over and decide what she would like to do for I could not makeup her mind for her.  She said she thought that it was unreasonable to quit now when she only had two or three more treatments to go, but she did indicate that the holiday weekend coming made her fearful and if she was uncomfortable after today’s instillation which she did choose to take then she would choose to cancel Friday’s appointment, also that she would not feel too badly over the holiday weekend.  I thought that was reasonable and agreed that that would work out.
PROCEDURE:
:  She was then given 10 mg of morphine subcutaneously because she did not feel she could tolerate the discomfort in the instillation without pain medicine.  We waited about 20 minutes.  The bladder was then instilled and the urethra was instilled with lidocaine gel which she tolerated and then after a 10-minute wait, the bladder was instilled with DMSO, Kenalog, heparin, and sodium bicarbonate, and the catheter was removed.  The patient retained the solution for one hour, changing position every 15 minutes and then voided to empty the bladder.  She seemed to tolerate it moderately well.  She is to call and let me know what she wishes to do about the Friday scheduled bladder instillation if she tolerated this then she is going to consider trying it.  If not, she will cancel and will start over next week or she will see Dr. Friesen.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm not doing so well. i'm in a lot of discomfort.
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that. can you tell me more about what's been going on?
[patient] well, i've been getting bladder instillations for my chronic interstitial cystitis, but they don't seem to be helping. they're actually making the pain worse. i'm considering asking dr. xyz for a nerve block or some other treatment because i can't function like this anymore.
[doctor] i understand. it sounds like you've been dealing with a lot of pain and discomfort. have you talked to dr. xyz about your concerns?
[patient] i called him the other day and he told me to complete the instillations and then come see him again, but i'm not sure i can handle it anymore.
[doctor] i see. well, it's completely up to you to decide what you want to do. have you considered any other treatment options?
[patient] i'm not sure. i just want the pain to go away. it's been really hard to take care of my children and do daily activities.
[doctor] i understand. we can explore other treatment options if the instillations are not working for you. i want to make sure you're comfortable and able to function in your daily life. let's talk about your medications. are you taking everything as prescribed?

[patient] yes, i'm allergic to compazine and allegra.

"SUBJECTIVE:
She is here for a followup on her weight loss on phentermine.  She has gained another pound since she was here last.  We talked at length about the continued plateau she has had with her weight.  She gained a pound the month before and really has not been able to get her weight any farther down than she had when her lowest level was 136.  She is frustrated with this as well.  We agree that if she continues to plateau she really should not stay on phentermine.  We would not want her to take it to maintain her weight but only to help her get her weight down, and she may have really lost any benefit from it, and she agrees.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Otherwise negative.  She has no specific complaints.  No shortness of breath, chest pain or palpitations.
PHYSICAL EXAM:
Vital signs:  Her blood pressure is fine.  Her diastolic is a little bit high, but otherwise okay.
General:  She appears in good spirits.  No apparent distress.
HEENT:  Negative.
Neck:  Supple without bruits.
Chest:  Clear.
Cardiac exam:  Regular without extra sounds.
ASSESSMENT:
Weight loss on phentermine, really has plateaued.
PLAN:
If she does not lose weight in the next month we will probably consider having her go off the phentermine.  If she does lose a couple of pounds, then we will keep her on it until she gets closer to her goal of 135 and then try to keep her there for one or two months and then stop.  She agrees with this plan.","[doctor] hi there, how are you doing today?
[patient] hi, doctor. i'm doing fine, thank you for asking.
[doctor] good to hear. so, i see you're here for a follow-up on your weight loss on phentermine. can you tell me how things have been going?
[patient] well, i've gained another pound since i was last here. i've been struggling with a plateau for the past couple of months and it's been frustrating.
[doctor] i can understand that. we talked about this last time and we agreed that if you continue to plateau, we might need to take you off phentermine. have you noticed any changes in your weight despite taking the medication?
[patient] no, i haven't. i think i may have lost any benefit from it.
[doctor] okay, that's good to know. have you experienced any other symptoms or side effects while taking phentermine?
[patient] no, nothing out of the ordinary.
[doctor] alright. let's go ahead and do a quick physical examination. your blood pressure is fine, but your diastolic is a little bit high. otherwise, everything seems to be normal. we can continue to monitor that. 
[patient] okay.
[doctor] given your plateau, we will keep you on phentermine for another month. however, if you do not lose any weight by then, we will consider taking you off of it. if you do lose a couple of pounds, we will keep you on it until you get closer to your goal of 135 pounds and then try to keep you there for one or two months before stopping. does this plan sound okay to you?
[patient] yes, it does. thank you for your help, doctor. 
[doctor] you're welcome. if you experience any side effects or symptoms, please do not hesitate to give us a call.","[doctor] hey there! how's everything going?

[patient] well, i've gained another pound since i was last here. i've been stuck on this plateau for the past couple of months and it's been pretty frustrating, ya know?
[doctor] ah, gotcha. we talked about this last time and we agreed that if you continue to plateau, we might need to take you off phentermine. have you noticed any changes in your weight since then?
[patient] nope, not really. i don't think it's doing much for me anymore.
[doctor] okay, that makes sense. have you experienced any other symptoms or side effects while taking phentermine?
[patient] nah, nothing out of the ordinary.
[doctor] cool. let's do a quick physical exam. your blood pressure is fine, but your diastolic is a little bit high. other than that, everything looks normal. we can keep an eye on that. 
[patient] alrighty.
[doctor] so, given your plateau, we'll keep you on phentermine for another month. however, if you don't lose any weight by then, we'll consider taking you off of it. if you do lose a couple of pounds, we'll keep you on it until you get closer to your goal of 135 pounds and then try to keep you there for one or two months before stopping. does that sound good to you?
[patient] yeah, that sounds good. thanks for all your help, doc. 
[doctor] no problemo! if you experience any side effects or symptoms, don't hesitate to give us a holler.",5
"REASON FOR VISIT:
The patient referred by Dr. X for evaluation of her possible tethered cord.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Briefly, she is a 14-year-old right handed female who is in 9th grade, who underwent a lipomyomeningocele repair at 3 days of age and then again at 3-1/2 years of age.  The last surgery was in 03/95.  She did well; however, in the past several months has had some leg pain in both legs out laterally, worsening at night and requiring Advil, Motrin as well as Tylenol PM.
Denies any new bowel or bladder dysfunction or increased sensory loss.  She had some patchy sensory loss from L4 to S1.
MEDICATIONS:
Singulair for occasional asthma.
FINDINGS:
She is awake, alert, and oriented x 3.  Pupils equal and reactive.  EOMs are full.  Motor is 5 out of 5.  She was able to toe and heel walk without any difficulties as well as tendon reflexes were 2 plus.  There is no evidence of clonus.  There is diminished sensation from L4 to S1, having proprioception.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
Possible tethered cord.  I had a thorough discussion with the patient and her parents.  I have recommended a repeat MRI scan.  The prescription was given today.  MRI of the lumbar spine was just completed.  I would like to see her back in clinic.  We did discuss the possible symptoms of this tethering.","[doctor] hi there, i see that dr. x referred you for an evaluation of your possible tethered cord. can you tell me more about your leg pain? 
[patient] yes, i have been having pain in both legs laterally, worse at night and requiring advil, motrin as well as tylenol pm. 
[doctor] i see. has this been going on for long? 
[patient] for the past several months. 
[doctor] have you experienced any new bowel or bladder issues or increased sensory loss? 
[patient] no, i haven't. 
[doctor] okay. i also see that you had a lipomyomeningocele repair when you were younger. how has your condition been since then? 
[patient] i did well after the surgery, but the leg pain has been new. 
[doctor] i understand. during your examination, i did note some diminished sensation from l4 to s1. based on your history and exam, it is possible that you have a tethered cord. 
[patient] what does that mean? 
[doctor] it means that the spinal cord is abnormally attached to the surrounding tissues, which can cause symptoms such as leg pain, numbness, or weakness. to confirm this, i have recommended a repeat mri scan, which you have recently completed. we will discuss the results at your next appointment. 
[patient] okay, what would be the next steps? 
[doctor] first, we need to wait for the results of the mri. after that, we will discuss the best course of treatment. in some cases, a surgical intervention may be necessary. do you have any questions for me? 
[patient] no, not at the moment. 
[doctor] alright, i will see you again soon to discuss the results of the mri and the next steps.","[doctor] hey there, so i see dr. x sent you over for us to check out your leg pain. can you give me some more deets on that? 
[patient] sure thing, i've been having pain on the sides of both legs, especially at night. been taking advil, motrin, and tylenol pm to deal with it. 
[doctor] got it. how long you been dealing with this? 
[patient] a few months now. 
[doctor] alright, any changes in your bladder or bowel movements or have you been losing sensation anywhere? 
[patient] nope, none of those things. 
[doctor] okay then. i see you had a surgery before for a lipomyomeningocele. how have things been since then? 
[patient] the surgery went well, but the leg pain is new. 
[doctor] understood. during your exam, i did notice some reduced sensation from l4 to s1. based on that and your history, it's possible you have a tethered cord. 
[patient] what's that mean? 
[doctor] basically, it's when your spinal cord is attached abnormally to the surrounding tissues, which can cause leg pain, numbness, or weakness. we did an mri to confirm this and we'll go over the results at your next appointment. 
[patient] alright, what's next then? 
[doctor] we gotta wait for the mri results first. after that, we'll figure out the best way to tackle this. in some cases, we might need to do surgery. any questions for me? 
[patient] not right now. 
[doctor] no problem. i'll see you soon to talk about the mri results and what we're gonna do next.",5

"REASON FOR VISIT:
Mr. ABC is a 30-year-old man who returns in followup of his still moderate-to-severe sleep apnea.  He returns today to review his response to CPAP.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient initially presented with loud obnoxious snoring that disrupted the sleep of his bed partner.  He was found to have moderate-to-severe sleep apnea (predominantly hypopnea), was treated with nasal CPAP at 10 cm H2O nasal pressure.  He has been on CPAP now for several months, and returns for followup to review his response to treatment.
The patient reports that the CPAP has limited his snoring at night.  Occasionally, his bed partner wakes him in the middle of the night, when the mask comes off, and reminds him to replace the mask.  The patient estimates that he uses the CPAP approximately 5 to 7 nights per week, and on occasion takes it off and does not replace the mask when he awakens spontaneously in the middle of the night.
The patient's sleep pattern consists of going to bed between 11:00 and 11:30 at night and awakening between 6 to 7 a.m. on weekdays.  On weekends, he might sleep until 8 to 9 a.m.  On Saturday night, he might go to bed approximately mid night.
As noted, the patient is not snoring on CPAP.  He denies much tossing and turning and does not awaken with the sheets in disarray.  He awakens feeling relatively refreshed.
In the past few months, the patient has lost between 15 and 18 pounds in combination of dietary and exercise measures.
He continues to work at Smith Barney in downtown Baltimore.  He generally works from 8 to 8:30 a.m. until approximately 5 to 5:30 p.m.  He is involved in training purpose to how to sell managed funds and accounts.
The patient reports no change in daytime stamina.  He has no difficulty staying awake during the daytime or evening hours.
The past medical history is notable for allergic rhinitis.
MEDICATIONS:
He is maintained on Flonase and denies much in the way of nasal symptoms.
ALLERGIES:
Molds.
FINDINGS:
Vital signs:  Blood pressure 126/75, pulse 67, respiratory rate 16, weight 172 pounds, height 5 feet 9 inches, temperature 98.4 degrees and SaO2 is 99% on room air at rest.
The patient has adenoidal facies as noted previously.
Laboratories:  The patient forgot to bring his smart card in for downloading today.
ASSESSMENT:
Moderate-to-severe sleep apnea.  I have recommended the patient continue CPAP indefinitely.  He will be sending me his smart card for downloading to determine his CPAP usage pattern.  In addition, he will continue efforts to maintain his weight at current levels or below.  Should he succeed in reducing further, we might consider re-running a sleep study to determine whether he still requires a CPAP.
PLANS:
In the meantime, if it is also that the possible nasal obstruction is contributing to snoring and obstructive hypopnea.  I have recommended that a fiberoptic ENT exam be performed to exclude adenoidal tissue that may be contributing to obstruction.  He will be returning for routine followup in 6 months.","[doctor] hi, mr. abc. how are you doing today?
[patient] hi, doctor. i'm doing well, thanks for asking.
[doctor] good to hear. so, i see here that you're still experiencing moderate-to-severe sleep apnea. can you tell me how the cpap has been working for you?
[patient] yes, the cpap has limited my snoring at night. occasionally, my bed partner wakes me in the middle of the night when the mask comes off, and reminds me to replace it. i estimate that i use the cpap around 5 to 7 nights per week, but sometimes i take it off and do not replace the mask when i wake up at night.
[doctor] i see. and how have you been feeling in the mornings when you wake up? do you feel refreshed?
[patient] yes, i do feel relatively refreshed in the mornings. i don't toss and turn much and i don't wake up with the sheets in disarray.
[doctor] that's good to hear. i also see that you've lost some weight in the past few months. that's great progress. have you noticed any improvement in your sleep apnea symptoms since losing weight?
[patient] not really, but i've been trying to maintain my weight at the current level or below.
[doctor] that's a good goal to have. i recommend that you continue using the cpap and also make efforts to maintain your weight. we might consider re-running a sleep study if you succeed in reducing further to determine whether you still require the cpap.
[patient] okay, i'll do my best to maintain my weight. is there anything else i can do to improve my sleep apnea symptoms?
[doctor] yes, i recommend that you have a fiberoptic ent exam performed to exclude adenoidal tissue that may be contributing to obstruction. you will also be sending me your smart card for downloading to determine your cpap usage pattern. you will be returning for routine followup in 6 months. does that sound good to you?
[patient] yes, that sounds good. thank you, doctor.","[doctor] hey, mr. abc. how's it going?
[patient] oh, hi there, doctor. i'm doing pretty good. thanks for asking.
[doctor] glad to hear it. so, looks like you're still dealing with that sleep apnea. how's the cpap machine been treating you?
[patient] yeah, the cpap machine's been okay. i still snore a bit, but not as much. sometimes, my bed partner wakes me up when the mask comes off. i'd say i use it around 5-7 nights a week, but some nights i forget to put it back on if i wake up.
[doctor] gotcha. and how do you feel when you wake up in the morning? are you feeling more rested?
[patient] yeah, i feel pretty good in the morning. i don't really toss and turn anymore and the sheets are pretty much in the same place as when i fell asleep.
[doctor] that's good to hear. i also see you've lost some weight recently, which is fantastic. have you noticed any improvement in your sleep apnea symptoms?
[patient] not really, but i'm trying to keep my weight where it's at or maybe even lose more.
[doctor] good goal to have. i suggest you keep on with the cpap and try to maintain your weight. we could consider running another sleep study if you lose more weight to see if you still need the machine.
[patient] alright, i'll do my best to keep the weight off. anything else i can do to improve things?
[doctor] yes, i recommend getting a fiberoptic ent exam to check for adenoidal tissue that might be causing a blockage. also, send me your smart card so i can check your cpap usage pattern. we'll schedule another follow-up in 6 months. sound good?
[patient] sounds good, doc. thanks.",5
"HISTORY:
Reason for ICU followup today is acute anemia secondary to upper GI bleeding with melena with dropping hemoglobin from 11 to 8, status post transfusion of 2 units PRBCs with EGD performed earlier today by Dr. X of Gastroenterology confirming diagnosis of ulcerative esophagitis, also for continuing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation with productive cough, infection and shortness of breath.  Please see dictated ICU transfer note yesterday detailing the need for emergent transfer transfusion and EGD in this patient.  Over the last 24 hours, the patient has received 2 units of packed red blood cells and his hematocrit and hemoglobin have returned to their baseline of approximately 11 appropriate for hemoglobin value.  He also underwent EGD earlier today with Dr. X.  I have discussed the case with him at length earlier this afternoon and the patient had symptoms of ulcerative esophagitis with no active bleeding.  Dr. X recommended to increase the doses of his proton pump inhibitor and to avoid NSAIDs in the future.  The patient today complains that he is still having issues with shortness of breath and wheezing and productive cough, now producing yellow-brown sputum with increasing frequency, but he has had no further episodes of melena since transfer to the ICU.  He is also complaining of some laryngitis and some pharyngitis, but is denying any abdominal complaints, nausea, or diarrhea.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure is 100/54, heart rate 80 and temperature 98.8.  Is and Os negative fluid balance of 1.4 liters in the last 24 hours.
GENERAL:  This is a somnolent 68-year-old male, who arouses to voice, wakes up, seems to have good appetite, has continuing cough.  Pallor is improved.
EYES:  Conjunctivae are now pink.
ENT:  Oropharynx is clear.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Reveals distant heart tones with regular rate and rhythm.
LUNGS:  Have coarse breath sounds with wheezes, rhonchi, and soft crackles in the bases.
ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender with no organomegaly appreciated.
EXTREMITIES:  Showed no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Capillary refill time is now normal in the fingertips.
NEUROLOGICAL:  Cranial nerves II through XII are grossly intact with no focal neurological deficits.
LABORATORY DATA:
Laboratories drawn at 1449 today, WBC 10, hemoglobin and hematocrit 11.5 and 33.1, and platelets 288,000.  This is up from 8.6 and 24.7.  Platelets are stable.  Sodium is 134, potassium 4.0, chloride 101, bicarb 26, BUN 19, creatinine 1.0, glucose 73, calcium 8.4, INR 0.96, iron 13%, saturations 4%, TIBC 312, TSH 0.74, CEA elevated at 8.6, ferritin 27.5 and occult blood positive.  EGD, final results pending per Dr. X's note and conversation with me earlier, ulcerative esophagitis without signs of active bleeding at this time.
IMPRESSION/PLAN,1.  Melena secondary to ulcerative esophagitis.  We will continue to monitor the patient overnight to ensure there is no further bleeding.  If there are no further episodes of melena and hemoglobin is stable or unchanged in the morning, the patient will be transferred back to medical floor for continuing treatment of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.
2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.  The patient is doing well, taking PO.  We will continue him on his oral Omnicef and azithromycin and continuing breathing treatments.  We will add guaifenesin and N-acetyl-cysteine in a hope to mobilize some of his secretions.  This does appear to be improving.  His white count is normalized and I am hopeful we can discharge him on oral antibiotics within the next 24 to 48 hours if there are no further complications.
3.  Elevated CEA.  The patient will need colonoscopy on an outpatient basis.  He has refused this today.  We would like to encourage him to do so.  Of note, the patient when he came in was on bloodless protocol, but with urging did accept the transfusion.  Similarly, I am hoping that with proper counseling, the patient will consent to further examination with colonoscopy given his guaiac-positive status, elevated CEA and risk factors.
4.  Anemia, normochromic normocytic with low total iron binding capacity.  This appears to be anemia of chronic disease.  However, this is likely some iron deficiency superimposed on top of this given his recent bleeding, with consider iron, vitamin C, folate and B12 supplementation and discharge given his history of alcoholic malnutrition and recent gastrointestinal bleeding.  Total critical care time spent today discussing the case with Dr. X, examining the patient, reviewing laboratory trends, adjusting medications and counseling the patient in excess is 35 minutes.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm feeling alright, thank you.
[doctor] i'm glad to hear that. so, we received the test results and the good news is that there is no active bleeding from your gastrointestinal tract. however, the tests did confirm that you have ulcerative esophagitis, which was causing the bleeding. the gastroenterologist, dr. x, recommended that we increase the dose of your proton pump inhibitor and avoid nsaids in the future. how does that sound to you?
[patient] okay, i understand.
[doctor] additionally, your cough and wheezing have improved but you are still producing yellow-brown sputum with increasing frequency. therefore, i'm going to continue your current medication and add guaifenesin and n-acetyl-cysteine to your treatment plan. this should help mobilize some of the secretions and improve your breathing. we will continue to monitor you overnight and if there are no further complications, we will transfer you back to the medical floor to continue treatment for your chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation. how does that sound to you?
[patient] that sounds good, thank you.
[doctor] there's one more thing i wanted to talk to you about. your cea levels came back elevated, indicating that you may have some issues with your colon. we recommend a colonoscopy to check for any abnormalities. it's important that we do this as early detection of any abnormality will help us to treat it more effectively. i understand that you refused the colonoscopy earlier, but i would encourage you to reconsider as it is important for your health.
[patient] okay, i'll think about it.
[doctor] great, that's all i have for you today. we will continue to monitor you and keep you updated on your progress.","[doctor] hey there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] um, i'm feeling alright, thank you.
[doctor] mm-hmm, that's good to hear. so, we got the test results and the good news is that there's no active bleeding from your gastrointestinal tract. however, we did find out that you have ulcerative esophagitis, which was causing the bleeding. dr. x, the gastroenterologist, recommended that we increase the dose of your proton pump inhibitor and avoid nsaids in the future. how does that sound to you?

"DIAGNOSIS:
Left breast adenocarcinoma stage T3 N1b M0, stage IIIA.
She has been found more recently to have stage IV disease with metastatic deposits and recurrence involving the chest wall and lower left neck lymph nodes.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS,1.  Glucosamine complex.
2.  Toprol XL.
3.  Alprazolam,4.  Hydrochlorothiazide.
5.  Dyazide.
6.  Centrum.
Dr. X has given her some carboplatin and Taxol more recently and feels that she would benefit from electron beam radiotherapy to the left chest wall as well as the neck.  She previously received a total of 46.8 Gy in 26 fractions of external beam radiotherapy to the left supraclavicular area.  As such, I feel that we could safely re-treat the lower neck.  Her weight has increased to 189.5 from 185.2.  She does complain of some coughing and fatigue.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,NECK:  On physical examination palpable lymphadenopathy is present in the left lower neck and supraclavicular area.  No other cervical lymphadenopathy or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy is present.
RESPIRATORY:  Good air entry bilaterally. Examination of the chest wall reveals a small lesion where the chest wall recurrence was resected.  No lumps, bumps or evidence of disease involving the right breast is present.
ABDOMEN:  Normal bowel sounds, no hepatomegaly.  No tenderness on deep palpation. She has just started her last cycle of chemotherapy today, and she wishes to visit her daughter in Brooklyn, New York. After this she will return in approximately 3 to 4 weeks and begin her radiotherapy treatment at that time.
I look forward to keeping you informed of her progress.  Thank you for having allowed me to participate in her care.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?

[patient] i've been feeling okay. i've been taking my medications as prescribed and dr. x has given me some carboplatin and taxol recently.
[doctor] that's good to hear. i see that you have gained some weight since your last visit. have you been following a specific diet plan or experiencing any changes in appetite?
[patient] no, i haven't been following a specific diet plan. i think the weight gain is due to my inactivity and my medication.
[doctor] i understand. i also see that you have been experiencing some coughing and fatigue. can you tell me more about that?

[doctor] that's good to hear. i see that you have gained some weight since your last visit. have you been following a specific diet plan or experiencing any changes in appetite?
[patient] no, i haven't been following a specific diet plan. i think the weight gain is due to my inactivity and my medication.

"HISTORY:
A is here for a follow up appointment at our Pediatric Rheumatology Clinic as well as the CCS Clinic.  A is a 17-year-old male with oligoarticular arthritis of his right knee.  He had a joint injection back in 03/2007 and since then he has been doing relatively well.  He is taking Indocin only as needed even though he said he has pain regularly, and he said that his knee has not changed since the beginning, but he said he only takes the medicine when he has pain, which is not every day, but almost every day.  He denies any swelling more than what it was before, and he denies any other joints are affected at this moment.  Denies any fevers or any rashes.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
On physical examination, his temperature is 98.6, weight is 104.6 kg; which is 4.4 kg less than before, 108/70 is his blood pressure, weight is 91.0 kg, and his pulse is 80.  He is alert, active, and oriented in no distress.  He has no facial rashes, no lymphadenopathy, no alopecia.  Funduscopic examination is within normal limit.  He has no cataracts and symmetric pupils to light and accommodation.  His chest is clear to auscultation.  The heart has a regular rhythm with no murmur.  The abdomen is soft and nontender with no :  visceromegaly.  Musculoskeletal examination showed good range of motion of all his upper extremities with no swelling or tenderness.  Lower extremities:  He still has some weakness of the knees, hip areas, and the calf muscles.  He does have minus/plus swelling of the right knee with a very hypermobile patella.  There is no limitation in his range of motion, and the swelling is very minimal with some mild tenderness.
In terms of his laboratories, they were not done today.
ASSESSMENT:
This is a 17-year-old male with oligoarticular arthritis.  He is HLA-B27 negative.
PLAN:
In terms of the plan, I discussed with him what things he should be taking and the fact that since he has persistent symptoms, he should be on medication every day.  I am going to switch him to Indocin 75 mg SR just to give more sustained effect to his joints, and if he does not respond to this or continue with the symptoms, we may need to get an MRI.  We will see him back in three months.  He was evaluated by our physical therapist, who gave him some recommendations in terms of exercise for his lower extremities.  Future plans for A may include physical therapy and more stronger medications as well as imaging studies with an MRI.  Today he received his flu shot.  Discussed this with A and his aunt and they had no further questions.","[doctor] hi a, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, i'm doing okay.
[doctor] great. i see here that you're still experiencing pain in your right knee, is that correct?
[patient] yes, that's right.
[doctor] okay. and you mentioned that you're only taking indocin as needed, even though you have pain almost every day?
[patient] yes, that's correct.
[doctor] i see. well, based on your symptoms, i think it would be best for you to take medication every day to manage your pain. i'm going to switch you to indocin 75 mg sr to provide more sustained relief to your joints, and we'll see how that works for you.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] if you don't respond to the new medication or continue to experience symptoms, we may need to get an mri to further evaluate the joint. in the meantime, i recommend that you continue to follow the exercise recommendations given to you by our physical therapist.
[patient] alright.
[doctor] we'll schedule a follow-up appointment for you in three months to see how you're doing. and congratulations on getting your flu shot today, that's very important.

In the first 12 hours after admission, the patient's pain decreased and also swelling of his cervical area decreased.  The patient was evaluated by Dr. X from the ENT while in house.  After reviewing the CT scan, it was felt that the CT scan was not consistent with mastoiditis.  The child was continued on IV fluid and narcotics for pain as well as Unasyn until the time of discharge.  At the time of discharge his pain is markedly decreased about 2/10 and swelling in the area has improved.  The patient is also able to take p.o. well.

"HISTORY OF PRESENT PROBLEM:
XYZ was seen by Dr. ABC for an FCR tendinitis.  We do not have his reports, but by history she has had two cortisone shots.  She plays musical instruments, and it does bother her from time to time.  She was considering surgery, but she takes ibuprofen and it seems to be well-controlled.  She is here now for consultation.
CLINICAL/PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:

General:  The patient is alert and oriented times three in no acute distress.
Skin:  No skin breakdown or hyperhidrosis.
Vascular:  2+ radial and ulnar artery pulses.
Musculoskeletal:  Wrist, elbow, shoulder and neck exams reveal no focal findings except for some tenderness to palpation over the FCR tendon on the scaphoid tubercle, but there is no SL instability and no signs of lunotriquetral instability or midcarpal instability.  The DRUJ is stable.  Flexion/extension of the fingers is all intact.  Forearm, elbow and shoulder exams reveal no other focal tenderness to palpation.
Neurologic:  Negative Tinel's, Phalen's and compression median nerve test.  APB, EPL and first dorsal interosseous have 5/5 strength.  Forearm, elbow and shoulder exams reveal no neurologic compromise.
Gait:  Normal.
Neck:  Negative Spurling sign.  Negative signs of thoracic outlet.
HEENT:  Pupils equal and reactive with no asymmetry.
CLINICAL IMPRESSION:
By history, possible FCR tendinitis.
EVALUATION/TREATMENT PLAN:  At this point, we have asked her some questions again.  She is not that sore at this point, and she has had a couple of cortisone shots.  Without being the initial treating physician, she has FCR tendinitis that fails to respond to cortisone shots.  She is a candidate for an FCR tunnel release.  It has been described and is effective for those patients with that problem.  My only consideration would be, if the patient should choose, to get an MRI when she is symptomatic to confirm the FCR tendinitis.  She will followup with Dr. ABC as needed or come back to us when she is thinking more along the lines of surgery.","[doctor] hi there, xyz. i see from your medical records that you've been experiencing some tenderness in your wrist. can you tell me more about it?
[patient] yes, i've been having some discomfort in my wrist. i play musical instruments, and it bothers me from time to time.
[doctor] i understand. when did you first notice the pain, and how severe is it?
[patient] it started a while ago, and it's been bothering me on and off. i've had two cortisone shots, which have helped, and i take ibuprofen when i need to.
[doctor] i see. during the physical examination, i noticed some tenderness in the fcr tendon on the scaphoid tubercle. however, there are no other focal findings, and the wrist, elbow, shoulder, and neck exams are normal. i don't see any signs of instability or neurologic compromise.
[patient] that's good to hear.
[doctor] based on your history and examination, it's possible that you have fcr tendinitis. if your symptoms continue to persist despite the cortisone shots, you may be a candidate for an fcr tunnel release. this surgery has been effective for patients with similar symptoms. however, before proceeding with the surgery, i would recommend getting an mri to confirm the diagnosis. you can follow up with dr. abc as needed, or come back to us if you're thinking more along the lines of surgery.

"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:
Azotemia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 36-year-old gentleman admitted to the hospital because he passed out at home.
Over the past week, he has been noticing increasing shortness of breath.  He also started having some abdominal pain; however, he continued about his regular activity until the other day when he passed out at home.  His wife called paramedics and he was brought to the emergency room.
The patient has had a workup at this time which shows bilateral pulmonary infarcts.  He has been started on heparin and we are asked to see him because of increasing BUN and creatinine.
The patient has no past history of any renal problems.  He feels that he has been in good health until this current episode.  His appetite has been good.  He denies swelling in his feet or ankles.  He denies chest pain.  He denies any problems with bowel habits.  He denies any unexplained weight loss.  He denies any recent change in bowel habits or recent change in urinary habits.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL:  A gentleman seen who appears his stated age.
VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure is 130/70.
CHEST:  Chest expands equally bilaterally.  Breath sounds are heard bilaterally.
HEART:  Had a regular rhythm, no gallops or rubs.
ABDOMEN:  Obese.  There is no organomegaly.  There are no bruits.  There is no peripheral edema.  He has good pulse in all 4 extremities.  He has good muscle mass.
LABORATORY DATA:
The patient's current chemistries include a hemoglobin of 14.8, white count of 16.3, his sodium 133, potassium 5.1, chloride 104, CO2 of 19, a BUN of 26, and a creatinine of 3.5.  On admission to the hospital, his creatinine on 6/27/2009 was 0.9.
The patient has had several studies including a CAT scan of his abdomen, which shows poor perfusion to his right kidney.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Acute renal failure, probable renal vein thrombosis.
2.  Hypercoagulable state.
3.  Deep venous thromboses with pulmonary embolism.
DISCUSSION:
We are presented with a 36-year-old gentleman who has been in good health until this current event.  He most likely has a hypercoagulable state and has bilateral pulmonary emboli.  Most likely, the patient has also had emboli to his renal veins and it is causing renal vein thrombosis.
Interestingly, the urine protein was obtained which is not that elevated and I would suspect that it would have been higher.  Unfortunately, the patient has been exposed to IV dye and my anxiety is that this too is contributing to his current problem.
The patient's urine output is about 30 to 40 mL per hour.
Several chemistries have been ordered.  A triple renal scan has been ordered.
I reviewed all of this with the patient and his wife.  Hopefully under his current anticoagulation, there will be some resolution of his renal vein thrombosis.  If not and his renal failure progresses, we are looking at dialytic intervention.  Both he and his wife were aware of this.
Thank you very much for asking to see this acutely ill gentleman in consultation with you.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?
[patient] not so good, i passed out at home and i have been experiencing shortness of breath and abdominal pain.
[doctor] i see, do you know what may have caused you to pass out?
[patient] no, i don't have a clue.
[doctor] alright, we ran some tests and found out that you have bilateral pulmonary infarcts, which means that there is a blockage in one of the blood vessels in your lungs. we have started you on heparin to help with that. however, we also noticed that your bun and creatinine levels are increasing. do you have a history of any renal problems?
[patient] no, i have never had any issues with my kidneys before.
[doctor] alright, based on your lab results and other tests, it seems like you may have a renal vein thrombosis, which is a blockage in the veins that bring blood to your kidneys. this can lead to acute renal failure.
[patient] oh no, what does that mean for me?
[doctor] we are hoping that your current anticoagulation will help to resolve the thrombosis. however, if your renal failure continues to progress, we may need to consider dialytic intervention. we ordered several chemistries and a triple renal scan to help us manage your condition. 
[patient] alright, thank you for explaining that to me.
[doctor] of course. we also suspect that you may have a hypercoagulable state which could be causing the blockages in your blood vessels. we will be monitoring your condition closely.

[patient] no, not at the moment.

[patient] uh, it was a bit tough in the beginning, but now i feel better.
[doctor] mm-hmm, i'm glad to hear that. tell me, how has the pain been? 
[patient] well, i've been taking the percocet as prescribed, so it has been manageable.
[doctor] okay, that's good to know. now, i see that the pathology report came back and it indicates that you have mullerian adenosarcoma.
[patient] oh, yeah, that's what the report says.
[doctor] right, i understand this might be overwhelming, but i want you to know that we will do everything we can to help you. i would like to refer you to an oncologist who can give you more information about the condition.
[patient] okay, that sounds good.
[doctor] great. in the meantime, i want you to remain at rest initially with progressive ambulation thereafter. avoid lifting, driving, stairs, or intercourse. call me if you have fevers, drainage, bleeding, or pain. i will also prescribe a medication to help with the pain.
[patient] alright, thank you.
[doctor] no problem. it's important to also discuss your family history, social history, and psychosocial needs. i will make sure our social worker speaks with you. please follow up with me in one week.
[patient] sure, i'll do that.
[doctor] alright, take care and let us know if you need anything.",5
"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:
Please evaluate stomatitis, possibly methotrexate related.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a very pleasant 57-year old white female, a native of Cuba, being seen for evaluation and treatment of sores in her mouth that she has had for the last 10-12 days.  The patient has a long history of severe and debilitating rheumatoid arthritis for which she has had numerous treatments, but over the past ten years she has been treated with methotrexate quite successfully.  Her dosage has varied somewhere between 20 and 25 mg per week.  About the beginning of this year, her dosage was decreased from 25 mg to 20 mg, but because of the flare of the rheumatoid arthritis, it was increased to 22.5 mg per week.  She has had no problems with methotrexate as far as she knows.  She also took an NSAID about a month ago that was recently continued because of the ulcerations in her mouth.  About two weeks ago, just about the time the stomatitis began she was placed on an antibiotic for suspected upper respiratory infection.  She does not remember the name of the antibiotic.  Although she claims she remembers taking this type of medication in the past without any problems.  She was on that medication three pills a day for three to four days.  She notes no other problems with her skin.  She remembers no allergic reactions to medication.  She has no previous history of fever blisters.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Reveals superficial erosions along the lips particularly the lower lips.  The posterior buccal mucosa along the sides of the tongue and also some superficial erosions along the upper and lower gingiva.  Her posterior pharynx was difficult to visualize, but I saw no erosions on the areas today.  There did however appear to be one small erosion on the soft palate.  Examination of the rest of her skin revealed no areas of dermatitis or blistering.  There were some macular hyperpigmentation on the right arm where she has had a previous burn, plus the deformities from her rheumatoid arthritis on her hands and feet as well as scars on her knees from total joint replacement surgeries.
IMPRESSION:
Erosive stomatitis probably secondary to methotrexate even though the medication has been used for ten years without any problems.  Methotrexate may produce an erosive stomatitis and enteritis after such a use. The patient also may have an enteritis that at this point may have become more quiescent as she notes that she did have some diarrhea about the time her mouth problem developed. She has had no diarrhea today, however. She has noted no blood in her stools and has had no episodes of nausea or vomiting.
I am not as familiar with the NSAID causing an erosive stomatitis.  I understand that it can cause gastrointestinal upset, but given the choice between the two, I would think the methotrexate is the most likely etiology for the stomatitis.
RECOMMENDED THERAPY:
I agree with your therapeutic regimen regarding this condition with the use of prednisone and folic acid.  I also agree that the methotrexate must be discontinued in order to produce a resolution of this patients’ skin problem. However, in my experience, this stomatitis may take a number of weeks to go away completely if a patient been on methotrexate, for an extended period of time, because the medication is stored within the liver and in fatty tissue.  Topically I have prescribed Lidex gel, which I find works extremely well in stomatitis conditions.  It can be applied t.i.d.
Thank you very much for allowing me to share in the care of this pleasant patient.  I will follow her with you as needed.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi doctor, i have these sores in my mouth for about 10-12 days now and it has been bothering me.
[doctor] i see. can you tell me more about your medical history? any medications or treatments that you are currently taking?
[patient] i have rheumatoid arthritis for which i have been treated with methotrexate for the past ten years. i was also taking an nsaid about a month ago that was recently continued because of the ulcerations in my mouth. i was also placed on an antibiotic for a suspected upper respiratory infection.
[doctor] i see. based on your history and physical examination, it appears that you have erosive stomatitis probably secondary to methotrexate even though the medication has been used for ten years without any problems.
[patient] okay, what do you suggest i do?
[doctor] i agree with your therapeutic regimen regarding this condition with the use of prednisone and folic acid. i also suggest that you discontinue your use of methotrexate to produce a resolution of this patients’ skin problem. however, this stomatitis may take a number of weeks to go away completely. i also suggest that you use lidex gel topically three times a day as it works extremely well in stomatitis conditions.
[patient] okay doctor, thank you for your help.
[doctor] you're welcome. i will follow up with you as needed.","[doctor] hey there! how are you feeling today?
[patient] hey doc, i've got these sores in my mouth that have been bothering me for like 10-12 days now.
[doctor] ah, got it. can you give me a little background on your medical history? what meds or treatments are you currently taking?
[patient] yeah, i've got rheumatoid arthritis and have been taking methotrexate for the last decade. also was on an nsaid about a month ago, which was recently continued because of the ulcerations in my mouth, and took an antibiotic for a respiratory infection.
[doctor] i see. based on your history and exam, it seems like you've got erosive stomatitis, probably secondary to methotrexate, even though you've been taking it without issue for 10 years.
[patient] alright, what's the plan then?
[doctor] i agree with your current therapy plan for this condition, which includes prednisone and folic acid. i also suggest discontinuing the use of methotrexate to resolve the skin problem. however, the stomatitis may take a few weeks to completely clear up. i'd also recommend using lidex gel topically three times a day, as it works really well for stomatitis.
[patient] okay, thanks, doc!
[doctor] no problem at all! i'll follow up with you as needed.",5
"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 53-year-old man, who presented to emergency room with multiple complaints including pain from his hernia, some question of blood in his stool, nausea, and vomiting, and also left lower extremity pain.  At the time of my exam, he states that his left lower extremity pain has improved considerably.  He apparently had more significant paresthesias in the past and now he feels that the paresthesias have improved considerably.  He does have a history of multiple medical problems including atrial fibrillation, he is on Coumadin, which is currently subtherapeutic, multiple CVAs in the past, peripheral vascular disease, and congestive heart failure.  He has multiple chronic history of previous ischemia of his large bowel in the past.
PHYSICAL EXAM,VITAL SIGNS:  Currently his temperature is 98.2, pulse is 95, and blood pressure is 138/98.
HEENT:  Unremarkable.
LUNGS:  Clear.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  An irregular rhythm.
ABDOMEN:  Soft.
EXTREMITIES:  His upper extremities are well perfused.  He has palpable radial and femoral pulses.  He does not have any palpable pedal pulses in either right or left lower extremity.  He does have reasonable capillary refill in both feet.  He has about one second capillary refill on both the right hand and left lower extremities and his left foot is perhaps little cool, but it is relatively warm.  Apparently, this was lot worst few hours ago.  He describes significant pain and pallor, which he feels has improved and certainly clinically at this point does not appear to be as significant.
IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
This gentleman with a history of multiple comorbidities as detailed above had what sounds clinically like acute exacerbation of chronic peripheral vascular disease, essentially related to spasm versus a small clot, which may have been lysed to some extent.  He currently has a viable extremity and viable foot, but certainly has significant making compromised flow.  It is unclear to me whether this is chronic or acute, and whether he is a candidate for any type of intervention.  He certainly would benefit from an angiogram to better to define his anatomy and anticoagulation in the meantime.  Given his potential history of recent lower GI bleeding, he has been evaluated by GI to see whether or not he is a candidate for heparinization.  We will order an angiogram for the next few hours and followup on those results to better define his anatomy and to determine whether or not if any interventions are appropriate.  Again, at this point, he has no pain, relatively rapid capillary refill, and relatively normal motor function suggesting a viable extremity.  We will follow him along closely.","[doctor]: hi there, how are you feeling?

"DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Respiratory failure improved.
2.  Hypotension resolved.
3.  Anemia of chronic disease stable.
4.  Anasarca improving.
5.  Protein malnourishment improving.
6.  End-stage liver disease.
HISTORY AND HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was admitted after undergoing a drawn out process with a small bowel obstruction.  His bowel function started to improve.  He was on TPN prior to coming to Hospital.  He has remained on TPN throughout his time here, but his appetite and his p.o. intake have improved some.  The patient had an episode while here where his blood pressure bottomed out requiring him to spend multiple days in the Intensive Care Unit on dopamine.  At one point, we were unsuccessful at weaning him off the dopamine, but after approximately 11 days, he finally started to tolerate weaning parameters, was successfully removed from dopamine, and has maintained his blood pressure without difficulty.  The patient also was requiring BiPAP to help with his oxygenation and it appeared that he developed a left-sided pneumonia.  This has been treated successfully with Zyvox and Levaquin and Diflucan.  He seems to be currently doing much better.  He is only using BiPAP in the evening.  As stated above, he is eating better.  He had some evidence of redness and exquisite swelling around his genital and lower abdominal region.  This may be mainly dependent edema versus anasarca.  The patient has been diuresed aggressively over the last 4 to 5 days, and this seems to have made some improvement in his swelling.  This morning, the patient denies any acute distress.  He states he is feeling good and understands that he is being discharged to another facility for continued care and rehabilitation.  He will be discharged to Garden Court skilled nursing facility.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS/INSTRUCTIONS:
He is going to be going with Protonix 40 mg daily, metoclopramide 10 mg every 6 hours, Zyvox 600 mg daily for 5 days, Diflucan 150 mg p.o. daily for 3 days, Bumex 2 mg p.o. daily, Megace 400 mg p.o. b.i.d.
Ensure 1 can t.i.d. with meals, and MiraLax 17 gm p.o. daily.  The patient is going to require physical therapy to help with assistance in strength training.  He is also going to need respiratory care to work with his BiPAP.  His initial settings are at a rate of 20, pressure support of 12, PEEP of 6, FIO2 of 40%.  The patient will need a sleep study, which the nursing home will be able to set up.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  On the day of discharge, heart rate 99, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure 102/59, temperature 98.2, O2 sat 97%.
GENERAL:  A well-developed white male who appears in no apparent distress.
HEENT:  Unremarkable.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Positive S1, S2 without murmur, rubs, or gallops.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes or crackles.
ABDOMEN:  Positive for bowel sounds.  Soft, nondistended.  He does have some generalized redness around his abdominal region and groin.  This does appear improved compared to presentation last week.  The swelling in this area also appears improved.
EXTREMITIES:  Show no clubbing or cyanosis.  He does have some lower extremity edema, 2+ distal pedal pulses are present.
NEUROLOGIC:  The patient is alert and oriented to person and place.  He is alert and aware of surroundings.  We have not had any difficulties with confusion here lately.
MUSCULOSKELETAL:  The patient moves all extremities without difficulty.  He is just weak in general.
LABORATORY DATA:
Lab work done today shows the following:  White count 4.2, hemoglobin 10.2, hematocrit 30.6, and platelet count 184,000.  Electrolytes show sodium 139, potassium 4.1, chloride 98, CO2 26, glucose 79, BUN 56, and creatinine 1.4.  Calcium 8.8, phosphorus is a little high at 5.5, magnesium 2.2, albumin 3.9.
PLAN:
Discharge this gentleman from Hospital and admit him to Garden Court SNF where they can continue with his rehab and conditioning.  Hopefully, long-term planning will be discharge home.  He has a history of end-stage liver disease with cirrhosis, which may make him a candidate for hospice upon discharge.  The family initially wanted to bring the patient home, but he is too weak and requires too much assistance to adequately consider this option at this time.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?

"REASON FOR REFERRAL:
Chest pain, possible syncopal spells.
She is a very pleasant 31-year-old mother of two children with ADD.
She was doing okay until January of 2009 when she had a partial hysterectomy.  Since then she just says ""things have changed"".  She just does not want to go out anymore and just does not feel the same.  Also, at the same time, she is having a lot of household stressors with both of her children having ADD and ODD and she feels she does not get enough support from her husband.  Her 11-year-old is having a lot of trouble at school and she often has to go there to take care of problems.
In this setting, she has been having multiple cardiovascular complaints including chest pains, which feel ""like cramps"" and sometimes like a dull ache, which will last all day long.  She is also tender in the left breast area and gets numbness in her left hand.  She has also had three spells of ""falling"", she is not really clear on whether these are syncopal, but they sound like they could be as she sees spots before her eyes.  Twice it happened, when getting up quickly at night and another time in the grocery store.  She suffered no trauma.  She has no remote history of syncope.  Her weight has not changed in the past year.
MEDICATIONS:
Naprosyn, which she takes up to six a day.
ALLERGIES:
Sulfa.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
She does not smoke or drink.  She is married with two children.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Otherwise unremarkable.
PEX:
BP:  130/70 without orthostatic changes.  PR:  72.  WT:  206 pounds.  She is a healthy young woman.  No JVD.  No carotid bruit.  No thyromegaly.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm.  There is no significant murmur, gallop, or rub.  Chest:  Mildly tender in the upper pectoral areas bilaterally (breast exam was not performed).  Lungs:  Clear.  Abdomen:  Soft.  Moderately overweight.  Extremities:  No edema and good distal pulses.
EKG:
Normal sinus rhythm, normal EKG.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM (FOR SYNCOPE):
Essentially normal study.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Syncopal spells - These do sound, in fact, to be syncopal.  I suspect it is simple orthostasis/vasovagal, as her EKG and echocardiogram looks good.  I have asked her to drink plenty of fluids and to not to get up suddenly at night.  I think this should take care of the problem.  I would not recommend further workup unless these spells continue, at which time I would recommend a tilt-table study.
2.  Chest pains - Atypical for cardiac etiology, undoubtedly due to musculoskeletal factors from her emotional stressors.  The Naprosyn is not helping that much, I gave her a prescription for Flexeril and instructed her in its use (not to drive after taking it).
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Reassurance that her cardiac checkup looks excellent, which it does.
2.  Drink plenty of fluids and arise slowly from bed.
3.  Flexeril 10 mg q 6 p.r.n.
4.  I have asked her to return should the syncopal spells continue.","[doctor] hi, how are you?
[patient] hi, i'm doing okay.
[doctor] so, you're here because of chest pain and possible syncopal spells?
[patient] yes, that's correct.
[doctor] can you tell me more about your symptoms?
[patient] i've been having chest pains that feel like cramps or a dull ache. also, i've had three spells of ""falling"" where i see spots before my eyes. i'm not sure if they're syncopal, but it's possible. i also feel tender in my left breast area and sometimes get numbness in my left hand.
[doctor] i see. and when do these symptoms usually occur?
[patient] the chest pain lasts all day long and the falling happened twice when i got up quickly at night and once in the grocery store.
[doctor] alright. i've reviewed your medical history and i see that you had a partial hysterectomy in january 2009. since then, you've been feeling different and stressed out due to your children's add and odd and lack of support from your husband. i suspect that the chest pain is due to musculoskeletal factors from emotional stressors. also, your ekg and echocardiogram look good, so i don't think there's a cardiac issue causing the syncopal spells. i suspect that it's simple orthostasis/vasovagal, so i've asked you to drink plenty of fluids and not get up suddenly at night. i've also prescribed flexeril to help with the chest pain. if the syncopal spells continue, we may need to do a tilt-table study.
[patient] okay, i understand. thank you for explaining that to me.
[doctor] of course. it's important to keep track of any changes or symptoms you experience and to let me know if anything worsens or persists.","[doctor] hi, how are you doing today?
[patient] um, hi. i'm doing okay.
[doctor] so, you're here because of chest pain and possible syncopal spells, right?
[patient] yeah, that's right.
[doctor] can you tell me more about your symptoms?
[patient] well, i've been having chest pains that feel like cramps or a dull ache. i've also had three spells of ""falling"" where i see spots before my eyes. i'm not sure if they're syncopal, but it's possible. oh, and i also feel tender in my left breast area and sometimes get numbness in my left hand.
[doctor] mm-hmm, i see. and when do these symptoms usually happen?
[patient] the chest pain lasts all day long and the falling happened twice when i got up quickly at night and once in the grocery store.
[doctor] alright. so, i've reviewed your medical history, and i see that you had a partial hysterectomy in january 2009. since then, you've been feeling different and stressed out due to your children's add and odd and lack of support from your husband. i suspect that the chest pain is due to musculoskeletal factors from emotional stressors. also, your ekg and echocardiogram look good, so i don't think there's a cardiac issue causing the syncopal spells. i suspect that it's simple orthostasis/vasovagal, so i've asked you to drink plenty of fluids and not get up suddenly at night. i've also prescribed flexeril to help with the chest pain. if the syncopal spells continue, we may need to do a tilt-table study.
[patient] okay, i understand. thank you for explaining that to me.
[doctor] of course. it's important to keep track of any changes or symptoms you experience and to let me know if anything worsens or persists.",5
"SUBJECTIVE:
This 23-year-old white female presents with complaint of allergies.  She used to have allergies when she lived in Seattle but she thinks they are worse here.  In the past, she has tried Claritin, and Zyrtec.  Both worked for short time but then seemed to lose effectiveness.  She has used Allegra also.  She used that last summer and she began using it again two weeks ago.  It does not appear to be working very well.  She has used over-the-counter sprays but no prescription nasal sprays.  She does have asthma but doest not require daily medication for this and does not think it is flaring up.
MEDICATIONS:
Her only medication currently is Ortho Tri-Cyclen and the Allegra.
ALLERGIES:
She has no known medicine allergies.
OBJECTIVE:
Vitals:  Weight was 130 pounds and blood pressure 124/78.
HEENT:  Her throat was mildly erythematous without exudate.  Nasal mucosa was erythematous and swollen.  Only clear drainage was seen.  TMs were clear.
Neck:  Supple without adenopathy.
Lungs:  Clear.
ASSESSMENT:
Allergic rhinitis.
PLAN:
1.  She will try Zyrtec instead of Allegra again.  Another option will be to use loratadine.  She does not think she has prescription coverage so that might be cheaper.
2.  Samples of Nasonex two sprays in each nostril given for three weeks.  A prescription was written as well.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, i'm here because of my allergies, they have been bothering me a lot lately.
[doctor] i see. can you tell me more about your symptoms?
[patient] yes, i used to have allergies when i lived in seattle but they seem to be worse here. i have tried claritin, zyrtec, and allegra. allegra worked for me last summer and i started using it again two weeks ago, but it doesn't seem to be working well anymore. i also have a swollen and erythematous nasal mucosa and mild erythema in my throat.
[doctor] i understand. based on your symptoms and medical history, it seems like you have allergic rhinitis. i will prescribe a new medication for you to try. you can try zyrtec again, or we can switch to loratadine. it may be cheaper since you don't think you have prescription coverage. we will also give you samples of nasonex, which is a prescription nasal spray, to use for three weeks.
[patient] okay, that sounds good. thank you. 
[doctor] you're welcome. let me know if you have any questions or concerns.","[doctor] hey there, how're you feeling today?
[patient] um, hi! i came here because my allergies have been acting up a lot lately.
[doctor] gotcha. can you give me more details about your symptoms?
[patient] yeah, so i've had allergies before when i lived in seattle, but they're worse now that i'm here. i've tried claritin, zyrtec, and allegra. allegra worked for me last summer so i started using it again two weeks ago, but it's not really doing much. i also have a swollen and red nose and a little bit of redness in my throat.
[doctor] i see. based on what you're saying, it sounds like you have allergic rhinitis. i'm going to prescribe you a new medication to try. you can give zyrtec another go or we can switch to loratadine. that one might be cheaper since you don't think you have prescription coverage. we'll also give you some samples of nasonex, a prescription nasal spray, to use for three weeks.

"PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Patient is a 46-year-old white male seen for annual physical exam and had an incidental PSA elevation of 4.0.  All other systems were normal.
PROCEDURES:
Sextant biopsy of the prostate.
Radical prostatectomy:  Excised prostate including capsule, pelvic lymph nodes, seminal vesicles, and small portion of bladder neck.
PATHOLOGY:
Prostate biopsy:  Right lobe, negative.  Left lobe, small focus of adenocarcinoma, Gleason's 3 + 3 in approximately 5% of the tissue.
Radical prostatectomy:  Negative lymph nodes.  Prostate gland showing moderately differentiated infiltrating adenocarcinoma, Gleason 3 + 2 extending to the apex involving both lobes of the prostate, mainly right.  Tumor overall involved less than 5% of the tissue.  Surgical margin was reported and involved at the apex.  The capsule and seminal vesicles were free.
DISCHARGE NOTE:
Patient has made good post-op recovery other than mild urgency incontinence.  His post-op PSA is 0.1 mg/ml.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling?
[patient] i'm doing okay, a bit sore, but alright.
[doctor] that's good to hear. so, as you know, we ran some tests as part of your annual physical exam and found that your prostate-specific antigen (psa) level was elevated, which led us to perform biopsy and prostatectomy. 
[patient] okay, and what were the results?
[doctor] your biopsy showed a small focus of adenocarcinoma in the left lobe, but the right lobe was negative. however, during the prostatectomy, we found moderately differentiated infiltrating adenocarcinoma gleason 3+2 which extended to the apex involving both lobes of the prostate, mainly the right.
[patient] what does that mean? 
[doctor] it means that we found cancer in your prostate gland, but it was limited to less than 5% of the tissue. we removed your prostate gland, pelvic lymph nodes, seminal vesicles, and a small portion of the bladder neck. the surgical margin was involved at the apex. however, the capsule and seminal vesicles were free. 
[patient] alright, what do i need to do now? 
[doctor] you don't need to do anything at this point. we will monitor your psa levels regularly to ensure that the cancer has not returned. your post-op psa level is 0.1 mg/ml, which is a good sign. however, you are experiencing mild urgency incontinence, which is a common side effect. we will work with you to manage this. 
[patient] okay, thank you for letting me know. 
[doctor] of course, please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any further questions or concerns.","[doctor] hey, how's it going? 
[patient] um, i'm doing alright, a little sore though.
[doctor] ah, gotcha. so, we did some tests during your annual check-up and your psa levels were a bit high. that led us to do a biopsy and prostatectomy. 
[patient] mm-hmm, and what did the results show? 
[doctor] well, the biopsy found a small area of adenocarcinoma in the left lobe, but the right was clear. but during the prostatectomy, we found moderate adenocarcinoma gleason 3+2 that spread to both lobes of the prostate, mainly the right. 
[patient] uh, what does that mean exactly? 
[doctor] it means that you have prostate cancer, but it was contained to less than 5% of the tissue. we removed your prostate, pelvic lymph nodes, seminal vesicles, and a small part of the bladder neck. the margins were involved at the apex, but the capsule and seminal vesicles were free. 
[patient] okay, what's next? 
[doctor] for now, we'll just keep an eye on your psa levels to make sure the cancer doesn't come back. your post-op psa is at 0.1 mg/ml, which is great. but you are experiencing some mild urgency incontinence, which is a common side effect. we'll help you manage that. 
[patient] alright, thanks for the heads up. 
[doctor] absolutely, let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.",4
"PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
The patient is a 63-year-old executive who was seen by his physician for a company physical.  He stated that he was in excellent health and led an active life.  His physical examination was normal for a man of his age.  Chest x-ray and chemical screening blood work were within normal limits.  His PSA was elevated.
IMAGING:
Chest x-ray:  Normal.
CT scan of abdomen and pelvis:  No abnormalities.
LABORATORY:
PSA 14.6.
PROCEDURES:
Ultrasound guided sextant biopsy of prostate:  Digital rectal exam performed at the time of the biopsy showed a 1+ enlarged prostate with normal seminal vesicles.
PATHOLOGY:
Prostate biopsy:  Left apex:  adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, Gleason's score 3 + 4 = 7/10.  Maximum linear extent in apex of tumor was 6 mm.  Left mid region prostate:  moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, Gleason's 3 + 2 = 5/10.  Left base, right apex, and right mid-region and right base:  negative for carcinoma.
TREATMENT:
The patient opted for low dose rate interstitial prostatic implants of I-125.  It was performed as an outpatient on 8/10.","[doctor] hi, how are you doing today?
[patient] i'm doing fine, thank you.
[doctor] so, we got your test results back and it looks like your psa levels are elevated. did you notice any symptoms?
[patient] no, i feel perfectly healthy.
[doctor] okay, we went ahead and did an ultrasound guided sextant biopsy of your prostate and the test revealed that you have prostate cancer.
[patient] oh no, what does that mean?
[doctor] it means that we found cancer cells in your prostate gland. we did further testing and found that the cancer is moderately differentiated, which means it's growing slower than other types of cancer.
[patient] what are my options for treatment?
[doctor] well, there are a few options. we can do surgery to remove the prostate, radiation therapy or implanting i-125 seeds that deliver low-dose radiation over time to kill the cancer cells. based on your medical history, we recommend the low dose rate interstitial prostatic implants of i-125. it's an outpatient procedure and it's been proven to be very effective. we can schedule it for you soon if you'd like?
[patient] yes, please. when can we do it?

"PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
This 71-year-old man went to his primary care physician for a routine physical.  His only complaints were nocturia times two and a gradual ""slowing down"" feeling.  The physical examination on 1/29 was within normal limits except for the digital rectal exam which revealed an asymmetric prostate gland with nodularity, R>L.  PSA was elevated.  The differential diagnosis for the visit was abnormal prostate, suggestive of CA.
IMAGING:
CT pelvis:  Irregular indentation of bladder.  Seminal vesicles enlarged.  Streaky densities in periprostatic fat consistent with transcapular spread to periprostatic plexus.  Impression:  prostatic malignancy with extracapsular extension and probable regional node metastasis.
Bone scan:  Negative for distant metastasis.
LABORATORY:
PSA 32.1,PROCEDURES:
Transrectal needle biopsy of prostate.  Pelvic lymphadenectomy and radical prostatectomy.
PATHOLOGY:
Prostate biopsy:  Moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma in the right lobe and poorly differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma in the left lobe of prostate.
Lymphadenectomy and prostatectomy:  Frozen section of removed pelvic lymph nodes demonstrated metastatic adenocarcinoma in one lymph node in the right obturator fossa.  Therefore, the radical prostatectomy was canceled.
Final pathology diagnosis:  Pelvic lymphadenectomy; left obturator fossa, single negative lymph node.  Right obturator fossa; metastatic adenocarcinoma in 1/5 lymph nodes.  Largest involved node 1.5 cm.
TREATMENT:
Patient began external beam radiation therapy to the pelvis.","[doctor] hi there, i understand that you came in for a routine physical exam. how have you been feeling lately?

[patient] no, nothing out of the ordinary.
[doctor] alright, let me just do a quick physical exam. everything looks good except for your prostate gland.
[patient] what's wrong with it?
[doctor] during the digital rectal exam, i felt some nodularity on the right side of the gland. we ran some tests and found that your psa levels are elevated.
[patient] what does that mean?
[doctor] well, it could be suggestive of prostate cancer. we ordered some imaging tests to confirm our suspicions.
[patient] and what did the imaging tests show?
[doctor] the ct scan of your pelvis showed an irregular indentation of your bladder, and the bone scan came back negative for distant metastasis. however, the ct scan did reveal some spread of the cancer to the periprostatic plexus.
[patient] so what's the plan?
[doctor] we performed a transrectal needle biopsy of the prostate and a pelvic lymphadenectomy. unfortunately, the lymph node biopsy came back positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma, so we had to cancel the radical prostatectomy that was planned.

"PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
1.  Left heart catheterization, left ventriculogram, aortogram, coronary angiogram.
2.  PCI of the LAD and left main coronary artery with Impella assist device.
INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:
Unstable angina and congestive heart failure with impaired LV function.
TECHNIQUE OF PROCEDURE:
After obtaining informed consent, the patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization suite in postabsorptive and nonsedated state.  The right groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Lidocaine 2% was used for infiltration anesthesia.  Using modified Seldinger technique, a 7-French sheath was introduced into the right common femoral artery and a 6-French sheath was introduced into the right common femoral vein.  Through the arterial sheath, angiography of the right common femoral artery was obtained.  Thereafter, 6-French pigtail catheter was advanced to the level of the distal aorta where angiography of the distal aorta and the bifurcation of the right and left common iliac arteries was obtained.  Thereafter, a 4-French sheath was introduced into the left common femoral artery using modified Seldinger technique.  Thereafter, the pigtail catheter was advanced over an 0.035-inch J-wire into the left ventricle and LV-gram was performed in RAO view and after pullback, an aortogram was performed in the LAO view.  Therefore, a 6-French JL4 and JR4 guiding catheters were used to engage the left and right coronary arteries respectively and multiple orthogonal views of the coronary arteries were obtained.
ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:
1.  LV-gram:  LVEDP was 15 mmHg.  LV ejection fraction 10% to 15% with global hypokinesis.  Only anterior wall is contracting.  There was no mitral regurgitation.  There was no gradient across the aortic valve upon pullback, and on aortography, there was no evidence of aortic dissection or aortic regurgitation.
2.  The right coronary artery is a dominant vessels with a mid 50% to 70% stenosis which was not treated.  The left main coronary artery calcified vessel with disease.
2.  The left anterior descending artery had an 80% to 90% mid-stenosis.  First diagonal branch had a more than 90% stenosis.
3.  The circumflex coronary artery had a patent stent.
INTERVENTION:
After reviewing the angiographic images, we elected to proceed with intervention of the left anterior descending artery.  The 4-French sheath in the left common femoral artery was upsized to a 12-French Impella sheath through which an Amplatz wire and a 6-French multipurpose catheter were advanced into the left ventricle.  The Amplatz wire was exchanged for an Impella 0.018-inch stiff wire.  The multipurpose catheter was removed, and the Impella was advanced into the left ventricle and a performance level of 8 was achieved with a cardiac output of 2 to 2.5 l/min.  Thereafter, a 7-French JL4 guiding catheter was used to engage the left coronary artery and an Asahi soft 0.014-inch wire was advanced into the left anterior descending artery and a second 0.014-inch Asahi soft wire was advanced into the diagonal branch.  The diagonal branch was predilated with a 2.5 x 30-mm Sprinter balloon at nominal atmospheres and thereafter a 2.5 x 24 Endeavor stent was successfully deployed in the mid-LAD and a 3.0 x 15-mm Endeavor stent was deployed in the proximal LAD.  The stent delivery balloon was used to post-dilate the overlapping segment.  The LAD, the diagonal was rewires with an 0.014-inch Asahi soft wire and a 3.0 x 20-mm Maverick balloon was advanced into the LAD for post-dilatation and a 2.0 x 30-mm Sprinter balloon was advanced into the diagonal for kissing inflations which were performed at nominal atmospheres.  At this point, it was noted that the left main had a retrograde dissection.  A 3.5 x 18-mm Endeavor stent was successfully deployed in the left main coronary artery.  The Asahi soft wire in the diagonal was removed and placed into the circumflex coronary artery.  Kissing inflations of the LAD and the circumflex coronary artery were performed using 3.0 x 20 Maverick balloons x2 balloons, inflated at high atmospheres of 14.
RESULTS:
Lesion reduction in the LAD FROM 90% to 0% and TIMI 3 flow obtained.  Lesion reduction in the diagonal from 90% to less than 60% and TIMI 3 flow obtained.  Lesion reduction in the left maintained coronary artery from 50% to 0% and TIMI 3 flow obtained.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and the inflations well with no evidence of any hemodynamic instability.  The Impella device was gradually decreased from performance level of 8 to performance level of 1 at which point it was removed into the aorta and it was turned off and the Impella was removed from the body and the 2 Perclose sutures were tightened.  From the right common femoral artery, a 6-French IMA catheter was advanced and an 0.035-inch wire down into the left common femoral and superficial femoral artery, over which an 8 x 40 balloon was advanced and tamponade of the arteriotomy site of the left common femoral artery was performed from within the artery at 3 atmospheres for a total of 20 minutes.  The right common femoral artery and vein sheaths were both sutured in place for further observation.  Of note, the patient received Angiomax during the procedure and an ACT above 300 was maintained.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Left ventricular dysfunction with ejection fraction of 10% to 15%.
2.  High complex percutaneous coronary intervention of the left main coronary artery, left anterior descending artery, and diagonal with Impella circulatory support.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications.  The estimated blood loss was 200 ml.  Estimated dye used was 200 ml of Visipaque.  The patient remained hemodynamically stable with no hypotension and no hematomas in the groins.
PLAN:
1.  Aspirin, Plavix, statins, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors as tolerated.
2.  Hydration.
3.  The patient will be observed over night for any hemodynamic instability or ischemia.  If she remains stable, the right common femoral artery and vein sheaths will be removed and manual pressure will be applied for hemostasis.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] hi, i'm feeling okay, a little tired but okay.
[doctor] that's good to hear. i just wanted to go over your results and see how you're doing. so, we found that you had unstable angina and congestive heart failure with impaired lv function, is that correct?
[patient] yes, that's right.
[doctor] okay. during the procedure, we performed a left heart catheterization, left ventriculogram, aortogram, and coronary angiogram. we found that your lv ejection fraction is between 10% to 15% with global hypokinesis and only the anterior wall is contracting, which means the left side of your heart is not pumping as well as it should.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] we also found that you had a mid 80% to 90% stenosis in your left anterior descending artery, and a more than 90% stenosis in your first diagonal branch. we decided to proceed with intervention on the left anterior descending artery and perform a percutaneous coronary intervention (pci) using an impella assist device. we were successful in reducing the lesions in the lad and diagonal to less than 60% and timi 3 flow was obtained. we also found that your left main coronary artery had a retrograde dissection, which we were able to successfully treat with a stent, reducing the lesion from 50% to 0% and also obtaining timi 3 flow.

"PROCEDURE:
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy and colonoscopy with biopsy.
INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:
A 17-year-old with history of 40-pound weight loss, abdominal pain, status post appendectomy with recurrent abscess formation and drainage.  Currently, he has a fistula from his anterior abdominal wall out.  It does not appear to connect to the gastrointestinal tract, but merely connect from the ventral surface of the rectus muscles out the abdominal wall.  CT scans show thickened terminal ileum, which suggest that we are dealing with Crohn's disease.  Endoscopy is being done to evaluate for Crohn's disease.
MEDICATIONS:
General anesthesia.
INSTRUMENT:
Olympus GIF-160 and PCF-160.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
Less than 5 mL.
FINDINGS:
With the patient in the supine position, intubated under general anesthesia.  The endoscope was inserted without difficulty into the hypopharynx.  The scope was advanced down the esophagus, which had normal mucosal coloration and vascular pattern.  Lower esophageal sphincter was located at 40 cm from the central incisors.  It appeared normal and appeared to function normally.  The endoscope was advanced into the stomach, which was distended with excess air.  Rugal folds were flattened completely.  There were multiple superficial erosions scattered throughout the fundus, body, and antral portions consistent with Crohn's involvement of the stomach.  The endoscope was advanced through normal-appearing pyloric valve into the first, second, and third portion of the duodenum, which had normal mucosal coloration and fold pattern.  Biopsies were obtained x2 in the second portion of the duodenum, antrum, body, and distal esophagus at 37 cm from the central incisors for histology.  Two additional biopsies were obtained in the antrum for CLO testing.  Excess air was evacuated from the stomach.  The scope was removed from the patient who tolerated that part of the procedure well.
The patient was turned and scope was changed for colonoscopy.  Prior to colonoscopy, it was noted that there was a perianal fistula at 7 o'clock.  The colonoscope was then inserted into the anal verge.  The colonic clean out was excellent.  The scope was advanced without difficulty to the cecum.  The cecal area had multiple ulcers with exudate.  The ileocecal valve was markedly distorted.  Biopsies were obtained x2 in the cecal area and then the scope was withdrawn through the ascending, transverse, descending, sigmoid, and rectum.  The colonic mucosa in these areas was well seen and there were a few scattered aphthous ulcers in the ascending and descending colon.  Biopsies were obtained in the cecum at 65 cm, transverse colon 50 cm, rectosigmoid 20 cm, and rectum at 5 cm.  No fistulas were noted in the colon.  Excess air was evacuated from the colon.  The scope was removed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to recovery in satisfactory condition.
IMPRESSION:
Normal esophagus and duodenum.  There were multiple superficial erosions or aphthous ulcers in the stomach along with a very few scattered aphthous ulcers in the colon with marked cecal involvement with large ulcers and a very irregular ileocecal valve.  All these findings are consistent with Crohn's disease.
PLAN:
Begin prednisone 30 mg p.o. daily.  Await PPD results and chest x-ray results, as well as cocci serology results.  If these are normal, then we would recommend Remicade 5 mg/kg IV infusion.  We would start Modulon 50 mL/h for 20 hours to reverse the malnutrition state of this boy.  Check CMP and phosphate every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for receding syndrome noted by following potassium and phosphate.  We will discuss with Dr. X possibly repeating the CT fistulogram if the findings on the previous ones are inconclusive as far as the noting whether we can rule in or out an enterocutaneous fistula.  He will need an upper GI to rule out small intestinal strictures and involvement of the small intestine that cannot be seen with upper and lower endoscopy.  If he has no stricture formation in the small bowel, we would then recommend a video endoscopy capsule to further evaluate any mucosal lesions consistent with Crohn's in the small intestine that we cannot visualize with endoscopy.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?
[patient] i'm feeling okay, a little groggy from the procedure.
[doctor] that's understandable. i wanted to go over the findings with you. we found multiple superficial erosions and ulcers in your stomach and colon, and marked cecal involvement with large ulcers and an irregular ileocecal valve. all of these findings are consistent with crohn's disease.
[patient] crohn's disease? what is that?
[doctor] crohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of your digestive tract from your mouth to your anus. it causes inflammation and ulcers, which can lead to abdominal pain and diarrhea.
[patient] okay, what's the plan then?
[doctor] we're going to start you on prednisone to reduce the inflammation, and we're waiting on some test results before starting remicade. we also want to reverse your malnutrition with modulon and check your blood work regularly to monitor for any changes. we may need to do another ct scan or upper gi to rule out any complications, and possibly a capsule endoscopy to further evaluate any other mucosal lesions. do you have any questions?
[patient] no, i think i understand. thank you, doctor.
[doctor] of course, we'll be here to support you every step of the way.","[doctor] hey there, how's it going?
[patient] um, i'm feeling okay, just a bit groggy from the procedure.
[doctor] yeah, that makes sense. so, i wanted to talk to you about the results we found. you've got multiple superficial erosions and ulcers in your stomach and colon, as well as some marked cecal involvement with large ulcers and an irregular ileocecal valve. all of these findings are consistent with crohn's disease.
[patient] oh, uh, what's crohn's disease again?
[doctor] crohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of your digestive tract, from your mouth to your anus. it can cause inflammation and ulcers, leading to abdominal pain and diarrhea.
[patient] got it. so, what's the plan?
[doctor] well, we're going to start you on prednisone to reduce the inflammation. we're waiting on some test results before starting remicade, and we're also going to reverse your malnutrition with modulon. we'll need to check your blood work regularly to monitor for any changes, and we may need to do another ct scan or upper gi to rule out any complications. it's also possible we may need to do a capsule endoscopy to further evaluate any other mucosal lesions. do you have any questions?

MEDICATIONS:
Fentanyl 125 mcg and Versed 7 mg slow IV push.
INDICATIONS:
This is a 50-year-old white male with dysphagia, which has improved recently with Aciphex.
FINDINGS:
The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and the above medications were administered.  The oropharynx was sprayed with Cetacaine.  The endoscope was passed, under direct visualization, into the esophagus.  The squamocolumnar junction was irregular and edematous.  Biopsies were obtained for histology.  There was a mild ring at the LES, which was dilated with a 15 to 18 mm balloon, with no resultant mucosal trauma.  The entire gastric mucosa was normal, including a retroflexed view of the fundus.  The entire duodenal mucosa was normal to the second portion.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication.

1.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease, biopsied.
2.  Distal esophageal reflux-induced stricture, dilated to 18 mm.
3.  Otherwise normal upper endoscopy.
PLAN:
I will await the results of the biopsies.  The patient was told to continue maintenance Aciphex and anti-reflux precautions.  He will follow up with me on a p.r.n. basis.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the upper endoscopy?
[patient] i'm doing okay, a little sore in the throat, but not too bad.
[doctor] that's normal. i wanted to go over the results of the procedure with you. the good news is that we found no major issues in your upper digestive tract, but we did find a few things that we need to address.
[patient] okay, what did you find?
[doctor] you have gastroesophageal reflux disease, which we biopsied, and you also have a distal esophageal reflux-induced stricture, which we dilated to 18 mm. the rest of your upper endoscopy was normal. we are waiting for the results of the biopsies to see what further treatment we need to do.
[patient] what does this mean for me?
[doctor] well, gerd is a chronic condition that requires management over time. we will continue your aciphex medication and add some anti-reflux precautions such as avoiding spicy and acidic foods, eating smaller meals, and avoiding laying down immediately after eating. as for the stricture, we have dilated it to 18 mm, which should help with your dysphagia.
[patient] do i need any further treatment?
[doctor] we will wait for the biopsy results to determine if there is any further action we need to take. in the meantime, i want you to follow up with me on a p.r.n. basis.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Melena.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Solitary erosion over a fold at the GE junction, gastric side.
PREMEDICATIONS:
Versed 5 mg IV.
REPORTED PROCEDURE:
The Olympus gastroscope was used.  The scope was placed in the upper esophagus under direct visit.  The esophageal mucosa was entirely normal.  There was no evidence of erosions or ulceration.  There was no evidence of varices.  The body and antrum of the stomach were normal.  They pylorus duodenum bulb and descending duodenum are normal.  There was no blood present within the stomach.
The scope was then brought back into the stomach and retroflexed in order to inspect the upper portion of the body of the stomach.  When this was done, a prominent fold was seen lying along side the GE junction along with gastric side and there was a solitary erosion over this fold.  The lesion was not bleeding.  If this fold were in any other location of the stomach, I would consider the fold, but at this location, one would have to consider that this would be an isolated gastric varix.  As such, the erosion may be more significant.  There was no bleeding.  Obviously, no manipulation of the lesion was undertaken.  The scope was then straightened, withdrawn, and the procedure terminated.
ENDOSCOPIC IMPRESSION:
1.  Solitary erosion overlying a prominent fold at the gastroesophageal junction, gastric side – may simply be an erosion or may be an erosion over a varix.
2.  Otherwise unremarkable endoscopy - no evidence of a bleeding lesion of the stomach.
PLAN:
1.  Liver profile today.
2.  Being Nexium 40 mg a day.
3.  Scheduled colonoscopy for next week.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling?
[patient] i'm okay, a little worried about my test results.

[patient] okay, that sounds good. should i be worried about the erosion? 
[doctor] we need to consider the possibility that it may be an erosion over a varix, which would be more significant. but we won't know for sure until we do further testing. that's why i want to schedule a colonoscopy for next week. 
[patient] okay, i'll make sure to do that.

"PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
EGD with biopsy.
INDICATION:
Mrs. ABC is a pleasant 45-year-old female with a history of severe diabetic gastroparesis, who had a gastrojejunal feeding tube placed radiologically approximately 2 months ago.  She was admitted because of recurrent nausea and vomiting, with displacement of the GEJ feeding tube.  A CT scan done yesterday revealed evidence of feeding tube remnant still seen within the stomach.  The endoscopy is done to confirm this and remove it, as well as determine if there are any other causes to account for her symptoms.  Physical examination done prior to the procedure was unremarkable, apart from upper abdominal tenderness.
MEDICATIONS:
Fentanyl 25 mcg, Versed 2 mg, 2% lidocaine spray to the pharynx.
INSTRUMENT:
GIF 160.
PROCEDURE REPORT:
Informed consent was obtained from Mrs. ABC's sister, after the risks and benefits of the procedure were carefully explained, which included but were not limited to bleeding, infection, perforation, and allergic reaction to the medications.  Consent was not obtained from Mrs. Morales due to her recent narcotic administration.  Conscious sedation was achieved with the patient lying in the left lateral decubitus position.  The endoscope was then passed through the mouth, into the esophagus, the stomach, where retroflexion was performed, and it was advanced into the second portion of the duodenum.
FINDINGS:
1.  ESOPHAGUS:  There was evidence of grade C esophagitis, with multiple white-based ulcers seen from the distal to the proximal esophagus, at 12 cm in length.  Multiple biopsies were obtained from this region and placed in jar #1.
2.  STOMACH:  Small hiatal hernia was noted within the cardia of the stomach.  There was an indentation/scar from the placement of the previous PEG tube and there was suture material noted within the body and antrum of the stomach.  The remainder of the stomach examination was normal.  There was no feeding tube remnant seen within the stomach.
3.  DUODENUM:  This was normal.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
ASSESSMENT:
1.  Grade C esophagitis seen within the distal, mid, and proximal esophagus.
2.  Small hiatal hernia.
3.  Evidence of scarring at the site of the previous feeding tube, as well as suture line material seen in the body and antrum of the stomach.
PLAN:
Followup results of the biopsies and will have radiology replace her gastrojejunal feeding tube.","[doctor] hi mrs. abc, how are you feeling?
[patient] hi doctor. i'm feeling nauseous and have had recurring vomiting.

"REASON FOR CATHETERIZATION:
ST-elevation myocardial infarction.
PROCEDURES UNDERTAKEN,1.  Left coronary system cineangiography.
2.  Right coronary system cineangiography.
3.  Left ventriculogram.
4.  PCI to the left circumflex with a 3.5 x 12 and a 3.5 x 8 mm Vision bare-metal stents postdilated with a 3.75-mm noncompliant balloon x2.
PROCEDURE:
After all risks and benefits were explained to the patient, informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the cardiac cath suite.  Right groin was prepped in usual sterile fashion.  Right common femoral artery was cannulated with the modified Seldinger technique.  A 6-French sheath was introduced.  Next, Judkins right catheter was used to engage the right coronary artery and cineangiography was recorded in multiple views.  Next, an EBU 3.5 guide was used to engage the left coronary system.  Cineangiography was recorded in several views and it was noted to have a 99% proximal left circumflex stenosis.  Angiomax bolus and drip were started after checking an ACT, which was 180, and an Universal wire was advanced through the left circumflex beyond the lesion.  Next, a 3.0 x 12 mm balloon was used to pre-dilate the lesion.  Next a 3.5 x 12 mm Vision bare-metal stent was advanced to the area of stenosis and deployed at 12 atmospheres.  There was noted to be a plaque shift proximally at the edge of the stent.  Therefore, a 3.5 x 8 mm Vision bare-metal stent was advanced to cover the proximal margin of the first stent and deployed at 12 atmospheres.  Next, a 3.75 x 13 mm noncompliant balloon was advanced into the margin of the stent and two inflations at 20 atmospheres were done for 20 seconds.  Final images showed excellent results with initial 99% stenosis reduced to 0%.  The patient continues to have residual stenosis in the mid to distal in the OM branch.  At this point, wire was removed.  Final images confirmed initial stent results, no evidence of dissection, perforation, or complications.
Next, an angled pigtail catheter was advanced into the left ventricular cavity.  LV pressure was measured.  LV gram was done in both the LAO and RAO projections and a pullback gradient across the aortic valve was done and recorded.  Finally, all guides were removed.  Right femoral artery access site was imaged and Angio-Seal deployed to attain excellent hemostasis.  The patient tolerated the procedure very well without complications.
DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS,1.  Left main:  Left main is a large-caliber vessel bifurcating in LAD and left circumflex with no significant disease.
2.  The LAD:  LAD is a large-caliber vessel, wraps around the apex, gives off multiple septal perforators, three small-to-medium caliber diagonal branches without any significant disease.
3.  Left circumflex:  Left circumflex is a large-caliber vessel, gives off a large distal PDA branch, has a 99% proximal lesion, 50% mid vessel lesion, and a 50% lesion in the OM, which is a distal branch.
4.  Right coronary artery:  Right coronary artery is a moderate-caliber vessel, dominant, bifurcates into PDA and PLV branches, has only mild disease.  Otherwise, no significant stenosis noted.
5.  LV:  The LVEF 50%.  Inferolateral wall hypokinesis.  No significant mitral regurgitation.  No gradient across the aortic valve on pullback.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
ST-elevation myocardial infarction with a 99% stenosis of the proximal portion of the left circumflex treated with a 3.5 x 12 mm Vision bare-metal stent and a 3.5 x 8 mm Vision bare-metal stent.  Excellent results, 0% residual stenosis.  The patient continues to have some residual 50% stenosis in the left circumflex system, some mild disease throughout the other vessels.  Therefore, we will aggressively treat this patient medically with close followup as an outpatient.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] i'm a little sore but overall feeling okay.
[doctor] good to hear. so, the reason for the catheterization was an st-elevation myocardial infarction. we performed left and right coronary system cineangiography, left ventriculogram, and pci to the left circumflex. during the procedure, we inserted two bare-metal stents and dilated them to fix a 99% proximal left circumflex stenosis. 
[patient] okay, i understand.
[doctor] we also found mild disease throughout your other vessels, but we were able to attain excellent hemostasis and you didn't experience any complications during the procedure. your lv pressure was measured, and the lvef is 50% with inferolateral wall hypokinesis. there was no significant mitral regurgitation or gradient across the aortic valve on pullback. 
[patient] alright.
[doctor] moving forward, we will be treating you medically as an outpatient since you still have some residual stenosis in the left circumflex system and mild disease throughout other vessels. 
[patient] what does that entail?
[doctor] it means that we will be monitoring your condition closely and treating you with medication to manage any symptoms or complications that may arise. we'll also schedule regular follow-up appointments to check on your progress.

"PROCEDURES UNDERTAKEN,1.  Left coronary system cineangiography.
2.  Right coronary system cineangiography.
3.  Cineangiography of SVG to OM.
4.  Cineangiography of LIMA to LAD.
5.  Left ventriculogram.
6.  Aortogram.
7.  Percutaneous intervention of the left circumflex and obtuse marginal branch with plano balloon angioplasty unable to pass stent.
NARRATIVE:
After all risks and benefits were explained to the patient, informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization suite.  The right groin was prepped in the usual sterile fashion.  Right common femoral artery was cannulated using a modified Seldinger technique and a long 6-French AO sheath was introduced secondary to tortuous aorta.  Next, Judkins left catheter was used to engage the left coronary system.  Cineangiography was recorded in multiple views.  Next, Judkins right catheter was used to engage the right coronary system.  Cineangiography was recorded in multiple views.  Next, the Judkins right catheter was used to engage the SVG to OM.  Cineangiography was recorded.  Next, the Judkins right was advanced into the left subclavian and exchanged over a long exchange length J-wire for a 4-French left internal mammary artery which was used to engage the LIMA graft to LAD and cineangiography was recorded in multiple views.  Next, an angled pigtail catheter was advanced into the left ventricular cavity.  LV pressures were measured.  LV gram was done and a pullback gradient across the aortic valve was done and recorded.  Next, an aortogram was done and recorded.  At this point, I decided to proceed with percutaneous intervention of the left circumflex.  Therefore, AVA 3.5 guide was used to engage the left coronary artery.  Angiomax bolus and drip was started.  Universal wire was advanced past the lesion and a 2.5-balloon was advanced first to the proximal lesions and predilations were done at 14 atmospheres and then to the distal lesion and predilatation was done at 12 atmospheres.  Next, we attempted to advance a 3.0 x 12 stent to the distal lesion; however, we were unable to pass the stent.  Next, second dilatations were done again with the 2.5 balloon at 18 atmospheres; however, we are unable to break the lesion.  We next attempted a cutting balloon.  Again, we are unable to cross the lesion, therefore a buddy wire technique was used with a PT choice support wire.  Again, we were unable to cross the lesion with the stent.  We then try to cross with a noncompliant balloon, which we were unsuccessful.  We also try to cutting balloon again, we were unsuccessful.  Despite multiple dilatations, we were unable to cross anything beyond the noncompliant balloon across the lesion; therefore, finally the procedure was aborted.  Final images showed no evidence of dissection, perforation, or further complication.  The right groin was filled after taking an image to confirm sheath placement above the bifurcation with excellent results.  The patient tolerated the procedure very well without complications, was taken off the operating table and transferred back to cardiac telemetry floor.
DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS,1.  The LV.  LVEDP was 4.  LVES is approximately 50%-55% with inferobasal hypokinesis.  No significant MR. No gradient across the aortic valve.
2.  Aortogram.  The ascending aorta shows no significant dilatation or evidence of dissection.  The valve shows no significant aortic insufficiencies.  The abdominal aorta and distal aorta shows significant tortuosities.
3.  The left main.  The left main coronary artery is a large caliber vessel, bifurcating the LAD and left circumflex with some mild distal disease of about 10%-20%.
4.  Left circumflex.  The left circumflex vessel is a large caliber vessel gives off a distal branching obtuse marginal branch.  The upper pole of the OM shows retrograde filling of the distal graft and also at that point approximately a 70%-80% stenosis.  The mid left circumflex is a high-grade 80% diffuse tortuous stenosis.
5.  LAD.  The LAD is a totally 100% occluded vessel.  The LIMA to LAD is patent with only a small-to-moderate caliber LAD.  There is a large diagonal branch coming off the proximal portion of the LAD and that proximal LAD showed some diffuse disease upwards of 60%-70%.  The diagonal shows proximal 80% stenosis.
6.  The right coronary artery:  The right coronary artery is 100% occluded.  There are retrograde collaterals from left to right to the distal PDA and PLV branches.  The SVG to OM is 100% occluded at its take off.  The SVG to PDA is not found; however, presumed 100% occluded given that there is collateral flow to the distal right.
7.  LIMA to LAD is widely patent.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
Attempted intervention to the left circumflex system, only able to perform plano balloon angioplasty, unable to pass stents, noncompliant balloons or cutting balloon.  Final images showed some improvement, however, continued residual stenosis.  At this point, the patient will be transferred back to telemetry floor and monitored.  We can attempt future intervention or continue aggressive medical management.  The patient continues to have residual stenosis in the diagonal; however, due to the length of this procedure, I did not attempt intervention to that diagonal branch.  Possible consideration would be a stress test as an outpatient depending on where patient shows ischemia, focus on treatment to that lesion.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling after the cardiac catheterization procedure?
[patient] i'm doing alright, a little sore around the groin area where they inserted the catheter.
[doctor] that's normal. i wanted to go over the results of the procedure with you. you have occlusions in both your lad and right coronary artery, and your left circumflex has significant stenosis. we were able to perform balloon angioplasty on the left circumflex, but were unable to pass the stent.

[doctor]: okay, that's good to know. during your physical exam, i noticed a soft systolic murmur in the aortic area. your lungs are clear, abdomen is soft, and there's no edema in your extremities. 
[patient]: oh, alright.
[doctor]: based on your medical history and exam, my impression is that you are responding well to medical management for your shortness of breath. you have chronic atrial fibrillation and are on anticoagulation, and also have severe aortic stenosis. 
[patient]: gotcha.
[doctor]: my recommendations for you are to continue your current medications, and follow-up with your cardiologist regarding your aortic stenosis. they may recommend a surgical intervention, which i have already explained to you. you will be discharged home on medical management, and have an appointment to see your cardiologist in the next few days. if you have any concerns or change your mind about anything, please call me back. 
[patient]: okay, thank you so much.",4
"REASON FOR VISIT:
Followup left-sided rotator cuff tear and cervical spinal stenosis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Ms. ABC returns today for followup regarding her left shoulder pain and left upper extremity C6 radiculopathy.  I had last seen her on 06/21/07.
At that time, she had been referred to me Dr. X and Dr. Y for evaluation of her left-sided C6 radiculopathy.  She also had a significant rotator cuff tear and is currently being evaluated for left-sided rotator cuff repair surgery, I believe on, approximately 07/20/07.  At our last visit, I only had a report of her prior cervical spine MRI.  I did not have any recent images.  I referred her for cervical spine MRI and she returns today.
She states that her symptoms are unchanged.  She continues to have significant left-sided shoulder pain for which she is being evaluated and is scheduled for surgery with Dr. Y.
She also has a second component of pain, which radiates down the left arm in a C6 distribution to the level of the wrist.  She has some associated minimal weakness described in detail in our prior office note.  No significant right upper extremity symptoms.  No bowel, bladder dysfunction.  No difficulty with ambulation.
FINDINGS:
On examination, she has 4 plus over 5 strength in the left biceps and triceps muscle groups, 4 out of 5 left deltoid, 5 out of 5 otherwise in both muscle groups and all muscle groups of upper extremities.  Light touch sensation is minimally decreased in the left C6 distribution; otherwise, intact.  Biceps and brachioradialis reflexes are 1 plus.  Hoffmann sign normal bilaterally.  Motor strength is 5 out of 5 in all muscle groups in lower extremities.  Hawkins and Neer impingement signs are positive at the left shoulder.
An EMG study performed on 06/08/07 demonstrates no evidence of radiculopathy or plexopathy or nerve entrapment to the left upper extremity.
Cervical spine MRI dated 06/28/07 is reviewed.  It is relatively limited study due to artifact.  He does demonstrate evidence of minimal-to-moderate stenosis at the C5-C6 level but without evidence of cord impingement or cord signal change.  There appears to be left paracentral disc herniation at the C5-C6 level, although axial T2-weighted images are quite limited.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
Ms. ABC's history, physical examination and radiographic findings are compatible with left shoulder pain and left upper extremity pain, which is due to a combination of left-sided rotator cuff tear and moderate cervical spinal stenosis.
I agree with the plan to go ahead and continue with rotator cuff surgery.  With regard to the radiculopathy, I believe this can be treated non-operatively to begin with.  I am referring her for consideration of cervical epidural steroid injections.  The improvement in her pain may help her recover better from the shoulder surgery.
I will see her back in followup in 3 months, at which time she will be recovering from a shoulder surgery and we will see if she needs any further intervention with regard to the cervical spine.
I will also be in touch with Dr. Y to let him know this information prior to the surgery in several weeks.","[doctor] hi ms. abc, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi doctor, i'm feeling okay, thank you for asking.
[doctor] absolutely, it's good to see you. so, let me take a look at your file. i see that you're here for a follow-up regarding your left shoulder pain and left upper extremity pain, is that correct?
[patient] yes doctor, that's right. i have a rotator cuff tear and i'm scheduled for surgery soon. i also have pain radiating down my left arm in a c6 distribution to the level of the wrist.
[doctor] okay, and have you noticed any changes in your symptoms since we last saw you?
[patient] no doctor, unfortunately my symptoms are unchanged.
[doctor] i see. well, i reviewed your physical examination and mri results and it appears that your pain is due to a combination of left-sided rotator cuff tear and moderate cervical spinal stenosis. i think that we can treat your radiculopathy non-operatively for now. i'm going to refer you for consideration of cervical epidural steroid injections, which will hopefully improve your pain and aid in your recovery from the shoulder surgery.
[patient] okay, that sounds good.
[doctor] great. i'll have you come back in for a follow-up in three months, at which point we'll see how you're recovering from the surgery and if you need any further intervention with regard to the cervical spine. i'll also be in touch with dr. y to let him know this information prior to your surgery in several weeks.
[patient] thank you doctor, i appreciate your help.
[doctor] of course, always happy to help.","[doctor] hey there ms. abc, how's everything going?
[patient] oh, hi doctor! i'm, um, feeling okay today. thanks for asking.
[doctor] ah, i see. well, it's good to see you again. so, let me take a look at your file real quick. looks like you're here for a follow-up regarding your left shoulder pain and left upper extremity pain, right?
[patient] yup, that's right, doc. i have a rotator cuff tear and um, i'm scheduled for surgery soon. i also have pain going down my left arm in a c6 distribution to the level of the wrist.
[doctor] gotcha. and have you noticed any changes in your symptoms since we last saw you?

[patient] thank you so much, doctor. i really appreciate your help.
[doctor] of course, always happy to help out.",4
"REASON FOR VISIT:
Six-month follow-up visit for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF).
She reports that she is getting occasional chest pains with activity.  Sometimes she feels that at night when she is lying in bed and it concerns her.
She is frustrated by her inability to lose weight even though she is hyperthyroid.
MEDICATIONS:
Tapazole 10 mg b.i.d.
atenolol/chlorthalidone 50/25 mg b.i.d.
Micro-K 10 mEq q.d.
Lanoxin 0.125 mg q.d.
spironolactone 25 mg q.d.
Crestor 10 mg q.h.s.
famotidine 20 mg, Bayer Aspirin 81 mg q.d.
Vicodin p.r.n.
and Nexium 40 mg-given samples of this today.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
No palpitations.  No lightheadedness or presyncope.  She is having mild pedal edema, but she drinks a lot of fluid.
PEX:
BP:  112/74.  PR:  70.  WT:  223 pounds (up three pounds).  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm with a 1/6 murmur at the upper sternal border.  Chest:  Nontender.  Lungs:  Clear.  Abdomen:  Moderately overweight.  Extremities:  Trace edema.
EKG:
Sinus bradycardia at 58 beats per minute, mild inferolateral ST abnormalities.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Chest pain-Mild.  Her EKG is mildly abnormal.  Her last stress echo was in 2001.  I am going to have her return for one just to make sure it is nothing serious.  I suspect; however, that is more likely due to her weight and acid reflux.  I gave her samples of Nexium.
2.  Mild pedal edema-Has to cut down on fluid intake, weight loss will help as well, continue with the chlorthalidone.
3.  PAF-Due to hypertension, hyperthyroidism and hypokalemia.  Staying in sinus rhythm.
4.  Hyperthyroidism-Last TSH was mildly suppressed, she had been out of her Tapazole for a while, now back on it.
5.  Dyslipidemia-Samples of Crestor given.
6.  LVH.
7.  Menometrorrhagia.
PLAN:
1.  Return for stress echo.
2.  Reduce the fluid intake to help with pedal edema.
3.  Nexium trial.","[doctor] hi there! how have you been?
[patient] hello. i have been having occasional chest pains with activity and sometimes at night when i am in bed. it's been concerning me.

[patient] sure.
[doctor] your ekg shows mild inferolateral st abnormalities and sinus bradycardia at 58 beats per minute. i will need you to return for a stress echo just to rule out anything serious. i suspect that your chest pain is due to your weight and acid reflux. i have given you samples of nexium to help with the reflux.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] your paf is due to hypertension, hyperthyroidism, and hypokalemia. let's keep you in sinus rhythm. your tsh was mildly suppressed, so i have put you back on tapazole. i have also given you samples of crestor for your dyslipidemia.

"DIAGNOSES:
1.  Cervical dystonia.
2.  Post cervical laminectomy pain syndrome.
Ms. XYZ states that the pain has now shifted to the left side.  She has noticed a marked improvement on the right side, which was subject to a botulinum toxin injection about two weeks ago.  She did not have any side effects on the Botox injection and she feels that her activities of daily living are increased, but she is still on the oxycodone and methadone.  The patient's husband confirms the fact that she is doing a lot better, that she is more active, but there are still issues yet regarding anxiety, depression, and frustration regarding the pain in her neck.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
The patient is appropriate.  She is well dressed and oriented x3.  She still smells of some cigarette smoke.  Examination of the neck shows excellent reduction in muscle spasm on the right paraspinals, trapezius and splenius capitis muscles.  There are no trigger points felt and her range of motion of the neck is still somewhat guarded, but much improved.  On the left side, however, there is significant muscle spasm with tight bands involving the multifidus muscle with trigger point activity and a lot of tenderness and guarding.  This extends down into the trapezius muscle, but the splenius capitis seems to be not involved.
TREATMENT PLAN:
After a long discussion with the patient and the husband, we have decided to go ahead and do botulinum toxin injection into the left multifidus/trapezius muscles.  A total of 400 units of Botox is anticipated.  The procedure is being scheduled.  The patient's medications are refilled.  She will continue to see Dr. Berry and continue her therapy with Mary Hotchkinson in Victoria.","[doctor] hi, ms. xyz. how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, doctor. i'm still in pain, but i think it's better than before.
[doctor] i see. you mentioned the pain has shifted to the left side. how long has that been going on?
[patient] it's been a while. maybe a few weeks.
[doctor] okay. and how did the botulinum toxin injection on the right side go?
[patient] it went well. i didn't have any side effects, and i feel like i'm able to do more things now.
[doctor] that's great to hear. on the physical exam, i noticed significant muscle spasm on the left side involving the multifidus muscle with trigger point activity and tenderness. we have decided to do a botulinum toxin injection into the left multifidus/trapezius muscles. the procedure will involve a total of 400 units of botox. how do you feel about that?
[patient] i'm willing to try anything that will help with the pain.
[doctor] okay. i'll go ahead and schedule the procedure. in the meantime, we will refill your medications. how have you been feeling emotionally?
[patient] it's been tough. i still feel anxious, depressed, and frustrated about the pain in my neck.

"REASON FOR VISIT:
Followup status post L4-L5 laminectomy and bilateral foraminotomies, and L4-L5 posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Ms. ABC returns today for followup status post L4-L5 laminectomy and bilateral foraminotomies, and posterior spinal fusion on 06/08/07.
Preoperatively, her symptoms, those of left lower extremity are radicular pain.
She had not improved immediately postoperatively.  She had a medial breech of a right L4 pedicle screw.  We took her back to the operating room same night and reinserted the screw.  Postoperatively, her pain had improved.
I had last seen her on 06/28/07 at which time she was doing well.  She had symptoms of what she thought was ""restless leg syndrome"" at that time.  She has been put on ReQuip for this.
She returned.  I had spoken to her 2 days ago and she had stated that her right lower extremity pain was markedly improved.  I had previously evaluated this for a pain possibly relating to deep venous thrombosis and ultrasound was negative.  She states that she had recurrent left lower extremity pain, which was similar to the pain she had preoperatively but in a different distribution, further down the leg.  Thus, I referred her for a lumbar spine radiograph and lumbar spine MRI and she presents today for evaluation.
She states that overall, she is improved compared to preoperatively.  She is ambulating better than she was preoperatively.  The pain is not as severe as it was preoperatively.  The right leg pain is improved.  The left lower extremity pain is in a left L4 and L5 distribution radiating to the great toe and first web space on the left side.
She denies any significant low back pain.  No right lower extremity symptoms.
No infectious symptoms whatsoever.  No fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath.  No drainage from the wound.  No difficulties with the incision.
FINDINGS:
On examination, Ms. ABC is a pleasant, well-developed, well-nourished female in no apparent distress.  Alert and oriented x 3.  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Respirations are normal and nonlabored.  Afebrile to touch.
Left tibialis anterior strength is 3 out of 5, extensor hallucis strength is 2 out of 5.  Gastroc-soleus strength is 3 to 4 out of 5.  This has all been changed compared to preoperatively.  Motor strength is otherwise 4 plus out of 5.  Light touch sensation decreased along the medial aspect of the left foot.  Straight leg raise test normal bilaterally.
The incision is well healed.  There is no fluctuance or fullness with the incision whatsoever.  No drainage.
Radiographs obtained today demonstrate pedicle screw placement at L4 and L5 bilaterally without evidence of malposition or change in orientation of the screws.
Lumbar spine MRI performed on 07/03/07 is also reviewed.
It demonstrates evidence of adequate decompression at L4 and L5.  There is a moderate size subcutaneous fluid collection seen, which does not appear compressive and may be compatible with normal postoperative fluid collection, especially given the fact that she had a revision surgery performed.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
Ms. ABC is doing relatively well status post L4 and L5 laminectomy and bilateral foraminotomies, and posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation on 07/08/07.  The case is significant for merely misdirected right L4 pedicle screw, which was reoriented with subsequent resolution of symptoms.
I am uncertain with regard to the etiology of the symptoms.  However, it does appear that the radiographs demonstrate appropriate positioning of the instrumentation, no hardware shift, and the MRI demonstrates only a postoperative suprafascial fluid collection.  I do not see any indication for another surgery at this time.
I would also like to hold off on an interventional pain management given the presence of the fluid collection to decrease the risk of infection.
My recommendation at this time is that the patient is to continue with mobilization.  I have reassured her that her spine appears stable at this time.  She is happy with this.
I would like her to continue ambulating as much as possible.  She can go ahead and continue with ReQuip for the restless leg syndrome as her primary care physician has suggested.  I have also her referred to Mrs. Khan at Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation for continued aggressive management.
I will see her back in followup in 3 to 4 weeks to make sure that she continues to improve.  She knows that if she has any difficulties, she may follow up with me sooner.","[doctor]: hi ms. abc, how are you feeling today?
[patient]: i'm good, thank you.
[doctor]: i'm reviewing your medical notes, and it looks like you had a laminectomy and spinal fusion a while back. how have you been feeling since then?
[patient]: overall, i've been doing well. the pain has improved, and i'm able to walk better than before the surgery.
[doctor]: that's great to hear. i see that you've been experiencing some pain in your left leg. can you tell me more about that?
[patient]: yes, it's a similar pain to what i had before the surgery, but in a different area of the leg. it radiates down to my great toe and first web space on the left side.
[doctor]: i see. well, i reviewed your radiographs and spinal mri, and they show adequate decompression at l4 and l5 with no malposition or change in orientation of the screws. the mri shows a moderate fluid collection, which appears to be normal postoperative fluid. i don't see any indication for another surgery at this time.
[patient]: okay.
[doctor]: i recommend that you continue with mobilization and ambulating as much as possible. i will refer you to a physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist for further management. you can also continue taking requip for your restless leg syndrome as your primary care physician has suggested. i would like to hold off on interventional pain management for now to decrease the risk of infection due to the fluid collection.
[patient]: alright.
[doctor]: i will see you back in 3-4 weeks to ensure that you're continuing to improve. if you have any difficulties, don't hesitate to follow up with me sooner. does that sound good?

"SUBJECTIVE:
This 32-year-old female comes in again still having not got a primary care physician.  She said she was at Dr. XYZ office today for her appointment, and they cancelled her appointment because she has not gotten her Project Access insurance into affect.  She says that Project Access is trying to find her a doctor.  She is not currently on Project Access, and so she is here to get something for the pain in her foot.  I did notice that she went in to see Dr. XYZ for a primary care physician on 05/14/2004.  She said she does not have a primary care physician.  She was in here just last week and saw Dr. XYZ for back pain and was put on pain medicines and muscle relaxers.  She has been in here multiple times for different kinds of pain.  This pain she is having is in her foot.  She had surgery on it, and she has plates and screws.  She said she was suppose to see Dr. XYZ about getting some of the hardware out of it.  The appointment was cancelled, and that is why she came here.  It started hurting a lot yesterday, but she had this previous appointment with Dr. XYZ so she thought she would take care of it there, but they would not see her.  She did not injure her foot in any way recently.  It is chronically painful.  Every time she does very much exercise it hurts more.  We have x-rayed it in the past.  She has some hardware there.  It does not appear to be grossly abnormal or causing any loosening or problems on x-ray.
PHYSICAL EXAM:
Examination of her foot shows some well-healed surgical scars.  On the top of her foot she has two, and then on the lateral aspect below her ankle she has a long scar.  They are all old, and the surgery was done over a year ago.  She is walking with a very slight limp.  There is no redness.  No heat.  No swelling of the foot or the ankle.  It is mildly tender around the medial side of the foot just inferior to the medial malleolus.  It is not warm or red.
ASSESSMENT:
Foot pain.
PLAN:
She has been in here before.  She seems very pleasant.  Thought maybe she certainly might be having some significant pain, so I gave her some Lortab 7.5 to take with a refill.  After she left, I got to thinking about it and looked into her record.  She has been in here multiple times for pain medicine.  She has a primary care physician, and now she is telling us she does not have a primary care physician even though she had seen Dr. XYZ not too long ago.  We called Dr. XYZ office.  Dr. XYZ nurse said that the patient did not have an appointment today.  She has an appointment on June 15, 2004, for a postop check.  They did not tell her they would not see her today because of insurance, so the patient was lying to me.  We will keep that in mind the next time she returns, because she will likely be back.  She did say that Project Access will be approving her insurance next week, so she will be able to see Dr. XYZ soon.","[doctor] hi there, how can i help you today?

Reports that he has been worked up extensively at hospital and was seeing an Endocrinologist at one time.  Reports that he had some indications of kidney damage when first diagnosed.  His urine microalbumin today is 100.  His last hemoglobin A1C drawn at the end of December is 11.9.  Reports that at one point, he was on Lantus which worked well and he did not worry about his blood sugars dropping too low. While using Lantus, he was able to get his hemoglobin A1C down to 7.  His last CMP shows an elevated alkaline phosphatase level of 168. He denies alcohol or drug use and is a non smoker.  Reports he quit drinking 3 years ago. I have discussed with patient that it would be appropriate to do an SGGT and hepatic panel today.  Patient also has a history of gastroparesis and impotence.  Patient requests Nexium and Viagra, neither of which are covered under the Health Plan.

Patient reports that he was in a scooter accident one week ago, fell off his scooter, hit his head.  Was not wearing a helmet.  Reports that he did not go to the emergency room and had a headache for several days after this incident.  Reports that an ambulance arrived at the scene and he was told he had a scalp laceration and to go into the emergency room.  Patient did not comply.  Reports that the headache has resolved.  Denies any dizziness, nausea, vomiting, or other neurological abnormalities.

[patient] hi, i'm doing okay.
[doctor] so, i see here that you have type 1 diabetes and have been off your insurance for over a year. can you tell me a bit about how you have been managing your blood sugars without regular check-ups?
[patient] yes, i have been using nph and regular insulin to maintain my blood sugars. however, i am very afraid of having low blood sugar due to a motor vehicle accident i had a few years ago that was caused by hypoglycemia.
[doctor] i understand your fear, but it is important to maintain a normal range of blood sugars to avoid further complications. have you been checking your blood sugar levels regularly?
[patient] no, i have been regulating my blood sugar levels based on how i feel.
[doctor] i see. well, it would be good to start checking your blood sugar levels regularly with a glucometer. additionally, your last hemoglobin a1c was 11.9 which is very high. it is important to get that number down to prevent further damage to your body.
[patient] i understand.
[doctor] you also mentioned that you were on lantus before and it worked well. i will consider that as a treatment option for you. however, i would like to take a few more tests to make sure that lantus is the best option for you. 
[patient] okay, sounds good.
[doctor] moving on, you also mentioned that you had a scooter accident recently. can you tell me a bit more about that?
[patient] yes, i fell off my scooter and hit my head. i had a headache for a few days after that, but it has resolved now.
[doctor] i see. you should have gone to the emergency room to get checked out. it's important to take any head injury seriously, especially if you weren't wearing a helmet. 
[patient] i know, but i didn't think it was that serious.
[doctor] it's always better to be safe than sorry. in any case, i see that you have some skin lacerations on your scalp from the accident. they appear to be healing well, but we will keep an eye on them.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] additionally, your urine microalbumin is at 100 which indicates some kidney damage. we will have to monitor that as well. 
[patient] okay.
[doctor] lastly, i see that you are requesting nexium and viagra, which are not covered by your health plan. unfortunately, i cannot prescribe those medications for you. however, we will continue to monitor your symptoms of gastroparesis and impotence and look for alternative treatments that may be covered by your insurance.
[patient] okay, that makes sense.

"REASON FOR VISIT:
Followup evaluation and management of chronic medical conditions.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient has been doing quite well since he was last seen.  He comes in today with his daughter.  He has had no symptoms of CAD or CHF.  He had followup with Dr. X and she thought he was doing quite well as well.  He has had no symptoms of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.  He has had no falls.  His right knee does pain him at times and he is using occasional doses of Tylenol for that.  He wonders whether he could use a knee brace to help him with that issue as well.  His spirits are good.  He has had no incontinence.  His memory is clear, as is his thinking.
MEDICATIONS:
1.  Bumex - 2 mg daily.
2.  Aspirin - 81 mg daily.
3.  Lisinopril - 40 mg daily.
4.  NPH insulin - 65 units in the morning and 25 units in the evening.
5.  Zocor - 80 mg daily.
6.  Toprol-XL - 200 mg daily.
7.  Protonix - 40 mg daily.
8.  Chondroitin/glucosamine - no longer using.
MAJOR FINDINGS:
Weight 240, blood pressure by nurse 160/80, by me 140/78, pulse 91 and regular, and O2 saturation 94%.  He is afebrile.  JVP is normal without HJR.  CTAP.  RRR.  S1 and S2.  Aortic murmur unchanged.  Abdomen:  Soft, NT without HSM, normal BS.  Extremities:  No edema on today's examination.  Awake, alert, attentive, able to get up on to the examination table under his own power.  Able to get up out of a chair with normal get up and go.  Bilateral OA changes of the knee.
Creatinine 1.7, which was down from 2.3.  A1c 7.6 down from 8.5.  Total cholesterol 192, HDL 37, and triglycerides 487.
ASSESSMENTS:
1.  Congestive heart failure, stable on current regimen.  Continue.
2.  Diabetes type II, A1c improved with increased doses of NPH insulin.  Doing self-blood glucose monitoring with values in the morning between 100 and 130.  Continue current regimen.  Recheck A1c on return.
3.  Hyperlipidemia, at last visit, he had 3+ protein in his urine.  TSH was normal.  We will get a 24-hour urine to rule out nephrosis as the cause of his hypertriglyceridemia.  In the interim, both Dr. X and I have been considering together as to whether the patient should have an agent added to treat his hypertriglyceridemia.  Specifically we were considering TriCor (fenofibrate).  Given his problems with high CPK values in the past for now, we have decided not to engage in that strategy.  We will leave open for the future.  Check fasting lipid panel today.
4.  Chronic renal insufficiency, improved with reduction in dose of Bumex over time.
5.  Arthritis, stable.  I told the patient he could use Extra Strength Tylenol up to 4 grams a day, but I suggest that he start with a regular dose of 1 to 2 to 3 grams per day.  He states he will inch that up slowly.  With regard to a brace, he stated he used one in the past and that did not help very much.  I worry a little bit about the tourniquet type effect of a brace that could increase his edema or put him at risk for venous thromboembolic disease.  For now he will continue with his cane and walker.
6.  Health maintenance, flu vaccination today.
PLANS:
Followup in 3 months, by phone sooner as needed.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i am doing well, thank you.
[doctor] great to hear that. so, i went through your medical history and you seem to be doing fine with no symptoms of cad, chf or hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. i see that you have occasional pain in your right knee, how is it doing now?
[patient] it still pains at times and i have been taking tylenol occasionally. i was also wondering if i could use a knee brace to help me with it.
[doctor] knee braces can have a tourniquet-like effect which can increase your edema or put you at risk for venous thromboembolic disease. so, for now, i suggest you stick to your cane and walker. 
[patient] okay, i will continue doing that.
[doctor] great. i see that your a1c is improving with increased doses of nph insulin and your diabetes is stable. we'll recheck a1c on return. 
[patient] okay.
[doctor] we also need to rule out nephrosis as the cause of your hypertriglyceridemia with a 24-hour urine test. given your problems with high cpk values in the past, we will not add tricor (fenofibrate) for now. we will check your fasting lipid panel today. 
[patient] alright.
[doctor] your chronic renal insufficiency has improved with the reduction in the dose of bumex over time. your arthritis is stable and you can take extra strength tylenol up to 4 grams a day but start with 1 to 2 to 3 grams per day. also, i suggest you continue with your current regimen and follow up in 3 months. you can get your flu vaccination today.

"HISTORY:
A is a young lady, who came here with a diagnosis of seizure disorder and history of Henoch-Schonlein purpura with persistent proteinuria.  A was worked up for collagen vascular diseases and is here to find out the results.  Also was recommended to take 7.5 mg of Mobic every day for her joint pains.  She states that she continues with some joint pain and feeling tired all the time.  Mother states that also her seizure has continued without any control so far.  She is having some studies in the next few days.  She is mostly stiff on her legs, neck, and also on her hands.  The rest of the review of systems is in the chart.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:

VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature today is 99.2 degrees Fahrenheit, weight is 45.9 kg, blood pressure is 123/59, height is 149.5 cm, and pulse is 94.
HEENT:  She has no facial rashes, no lymphadenopathy, no alopecia, no oral ulcerations.  Pupils are reactive to accommodation.  Funduscopic examination is within normal limits.
NECK:  No neck masses.
CHEST:  Clear to auscultation.
HEART:  Regular rhythm with no murmur.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender with no visceromegaly.
SKIN:  No rashes today.
MUSCULOSKELETAL:  Examination shows good range of motion with no swelling or tenderness in any of her joints of the upper extremities, but she does have minus/plus swelling of her knees with flexion contracture bilaterally on both.
LABORATORY DATA:
Laboratories were not done recently, but we have some lab results from the previous evaluation that basically is negative for any collagen vascular disease, but shows some evidence of decreased calcium and vitamin D levels.
ASSESSMENT:
This is a patient, who today presents with symptoms consistent with possible oligoarticular arthritis of her knees with also arthralgias and deficiency in vitamin D.  She also has chronic proteinuria and seizure disorder.  My recommendation is to start her on vitamin D and calcium supplements, and also increase the Mobic to 50 mg, which is one of the few things she can tolerate with all the medication she is taking.  We are going to refer her to physical therapy and see her back in 2 months for followup.  The plan was discussed with A and her parents and they have no further questions.","[doctor] hi a, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi doctor, i am not feeling well. i am having joint pains and feel tired all the time.
[doctor] i see. i have reviewed your medical history and physical exam, and based on that, it looks like you may have oligoarticular arthritis of your knees. we also found that you have low levels of vitamin d and calcium. i want to start you on vitamin d and calcium supplements, and increase your mobic dosage to 50 mg. we will also refer you to physical therapy to help with your joint pains.
[patient] okay, doctor. what about my seizure disorder?

Lanoxin, Capoten, Lasix, KCL, ASA, Voltaren, Alupent MDI,PMH:
CHF, Atrial Fibrillation, Obesity, Anemia, Duodenal Ulcer, Spinal AVM resection 1986 with residual T9 sensory level, hyperreflexia and bilateral babinski signs, COPD.
EXAM:
35.5C, BP 140/91, P86, RR20. Alert and oriented to person, place, and time. CN: No light perception OS, Pupils: 3/7 decreasing to 2/7 on exposure to light (i.e.
fixed/dilated pupil OS). Upon neutral gaze the left eye deviated laterally and inferiorly. There was complete ptosis OS. On downward gaze their was intorsion OS. The left eye could not move superiorly, medially or effectively downward, but could move laterally. EOM were full OD. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable. Motor, Coordination, Station and Gait testing were unremarkable. Sensory exam revealed decreased pinprick and light touch below T9 (old). Muscle stretch reflexes were increased (3+/3+) in both lower extremities and there were bilateral babinski signs (old). The upper extremity reflexes were symmetrical (2/2). Cardiovascular exam revealed an irregularly irregular rhythm and lung sounds were coarse bilaterally. The rest of the general exam was unremarkable.
LAB:
CBC, PT/PTT, General Screen were unremarkable except for a BUN 21mg/DL. CSF: protein 88mg/DL, glucose 58mg/DL, RBC 2800/mm3, WBC 1/mm3. ANA, RF, TSH, FT4 were WNL.
IMPRESSION:
CN3 palsy and loss of vision. Differential diagnosis: temporal arteritis, aneurysm, intracranial mass.
COURSE:
The outside Brain CT revealed a tortuous left MCA. A four-vessel cerebral angiogram revealed a dolichoectatic basilar artery and tortuous LICA. There was no evidence of aneursym. Transesophageal Echocardiogram revealed atrial enlargement only. Neuroopthalmologic evaluation revealed: Loss of color vision and visual acuity OS, RAPD OS, bilateral optic disk pallor (OS > OD), CN3 palsy and bilateral temporal field loss, OS >> OD . ESR, CRP, MRI were recommended to rule out temporal arteritis and intracranial mass. ESR 29mm/Hr, CRP 4.3mg/DL (high)
The patient was placed on prednisone. Temporal artery biopsy showed no evidence of vasculitis. MRI scan could not be obtained due to patient weight. Sellar CT was done instead: coronal sections revealed sellar enlargement and upward bowing of the diaphragm sella suggesting a pituitary mass. In retrospect sellar enlargement could be seen on the angiogram X-rays. Differential consideration was given to cystic pituitary adenoma, noncalcified craniopharyngioma, or Rathke's cleft cyst with solid component. The patient refused surgery. He was seen in Neuroopthalmology Clinic 2/18/93 and was found to have mild recovery of vision OS and improved visual fields. Aberrant reinnervation of the 3rd nerve was noted as there was constriction of the pupil (OS) on adduction, downgaze and upgaze. The upper eyelid, OS, elevated on adduction and down gaze, OS. EOM movements were otherwise full and there was no evidence of ptosis. In retrospect he was felt to have suffered pituitary apoplexy in 11/92.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?
[patient] not good, i have a headache and have lost some vision in my left eye.
[doctor] i see. can you tell me more about your headache?
[patient] it was a very strong headache that lasted for several days. it started after i had a sneezing fit on november 5th, 1992.
[doctor] and when did you notice the loss of vision in your left eye?
[patient] two days later, on november 7th, 1992. it was very sudden and painful.
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that. have you been seen by a doctor yet?
[patient] yes, i was seen locally and the brain ct didn't show any bleeding, but they did find a tortuous left middle cerebral artery. then i was transferred to uihc on november 12th, 1992.
[doctor] i see. do you have any family history of hypertension or stroke?
[patient] yes, my family has a history of hypertension, stroke, coronary artery disease, and melanoma.
[doctor] okay. and have you ever smoked before?
[patient] yes, but i quit 15 years ago.
[doctor] that's good to hear. now, i see that you have a history of chf, atrial fibrillation, obesity, anemia, duodenal ulcer, spinal avm resection, hyperreflexia, and bilateral babinski signs. are you currently taking any medications?
[patient] yes, i'm taking lanoxin, capoten, lasix, kcl, asa, voltaren, and alupent mdi.
[doctor] alright, thank you for letting me know. i will order some tests and imaging to help diagnose your condition. we need to rule out temporal arteritis, aneurysm, and intracranial mass. we'll also check your esr and crp levels to see if you have inflammation. in the meantime, i'm going to prescribe prednisone to help with the inflammation. and i'd like you to come back in for a follow-up appointment in a few weeks.
[patient] okay, thank you.
[doctor] you're welcome. let's get started on these tests and get you feeling better.","[doctor] hey there, how's it going?
[patient] not good... i have a headache and my vision's going in my left eye.
[doctor] hmm, can you tell me more about the headache?
[patient] yeah, it was a really bad one that lasted for a few days. it started after i had a sneezing fit on november 5th, 1992.
[doctor] and when did the vision loss start?
[patient] two days after, on november 7th, 1992. it was super sudden and painful.
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that. have you seen a doctor yet?
[patient] yup, i went to a local doc and they did a brain ct, but they didn't find any bleeding. they did find a tortuous left middle cerebral artery though, so i got transferred to uihc on november 12th, 1992.
[doctor] okay... do you have a family history of hypertension or stroke?
[patient] yeah, unfortunately, they have a history of hypertension, stroke, coronary artery disease, and melanoma.
[doctor] got it. have you ever smoked before?
[patient] yeah, but i quit about 15 years ago.
[doctor] that's good to know. so, you have a history of chf, atrial fibrillation, obesity, anemia, duodenal ulcer, spinal avm resection, hyperreflexia, and bilateral babinski signs. are you taking any meds right now?
[patient] yeah, i'm taking lanoxin, capoten, lasix, kcl, asa, voltaren, and alupent mdi.

[patient] okay, thanks!
[doctor] no problem, we'll get you on the road to recovery in no time!",4
"HISTORY:
The patient is a 78-year-old right-handed inpatient with longstanding history of cervical spinal stenosis status post decompression, opioid dependence, who has had longstanding low back pain radiating into the right leg.  She was undergoing a spinal epidural injection about a month ago and had worsening of right low back pain, which radiates down into her buttocks and down to posterior aspect of her thigh into her knee.  This has required large amounts of opioid analgesics to control.  She has been basically bedridden because of this.  She was brought into hospital for further investigations.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
On examination, she has positive straight leg rising on the right with severe shooting, radicular type pain with right leg movement.  Difficult to assess individual muscles, but strength is largely intact.  Sensory examination is symmetric.  Deep tendon reflexes reveal hyporeflexia in both patellae, which probably represents a cervical myelopathy from prior cord compression.  She has slightly decreased right versus left ankle reflexes.  The Babinski's are positive.  On nerve conduction studies, motor and sensory distal latencies, evoked response amplitudes, conduction velocities, and F-waves are normal in lower extremities.
NEEDLE EMG:
Needle EMG was performed on the right leg and lumbosacral paraspinal muscles using a disposable concentric needle.  It reveals the spontaneous activity in right peroneus longus and gastrocnemius medialis muscles as well as the right lower lumbosacral paraspinal muscles.  There is evidence of denervation in right gastrocnemius medialis muscle.
IMPRESSION:
This electrical study is abnormal.  It reveals the following:
1.  Inactive right S1 (L5) radiculopathy.
2.  There is no evidence of left lower extremity radiculopathy, peripheral neuropathy or entrapment neuropathy.
Results were discussed with the patient and she is scheduled for imaging studies in the next day.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm not doing well, doctor. my low back pain has been getting worse.
[doctor] i understand. let me take a look at your medical history. i see that you have cervical spinal stenosis and have undergone decompression in the past. you also had low back pain that radiates to your right leg. is that correct?
[patient] yes, that's right.
[doctor] i see that you had a spinal epidural injection recently. did it help with your pain?
[patient] actually, it made things worse. the pain in my right low back has worsened and it now radiates down to my buttocks, thigh, and knee. i've been taking a lot of opioid analgesics to control the pain and i've been bedridden because of it.
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that. let me perform a physical examination to determine the extent of your condition. okay?
[patient] yes, please.
[doctor] on examination, i noticed that you have shooting, radicular type pain when you move your right leg. i also observed hyporeflexia in both patellae, which may indicate cervical myelopathy from prior cord compression. you have slightly decreased ankle reflexes on the right side and a positive babinski's sign. i ordered a needle emg test which showed abnormal results.
[patient] what does that mean?
[doctor] the needle emg test showed signs of denervation in your right gastrocnemius medialis muscle, which indicates inactive right s1 (l5) radiculopathy. there is no evidence of left lower extremity radiculopathy, peripheral neuropathy or entrapment neuropathy. we will schedule imaging studies tomorrow to get a more detailed look at your condition.
[patient] okay, thank you, doctor.","[doctor] hey there, how're you feeling today?
[patient] um, not great, doc. my low back pain's been getting worse.
[doctor] got it. let me take a look at your medical history. so, you've had cervical spinal stenosis and decompression in the past, right? plus low back pain that goes down your right leg?
[patient] mm-hmm, that's right.
[doctor] okay, i see you had a spinal epidural injection recently. did it help?
[patient] nope, it made things worse. the pain in my right low back's worse and now it goes down to my buttocks, thigh, and knee. i've been taking a lot of opioid analgesics and i've been stuck in bed.
[doctor] sorry to hear that. let me give you a physical examination to see what's going on, okay?
[patient] yeah, sure.
[doctor] during the examination, i noticed you get shooting, radicular pain when you move your right leg. plus, there's hyporeflexia in both patellas, which could mean cervical myelopathy from prior cord compression. you have slightly decreased ankle reflexes on the right and a positive babinski's sign. i also ordered a needle emg test which showed abnormal results.
[patient] what does that mean?
[doctor] it means the needle emg test showed signs of denervation in your right gastrocnemius medialis muscle, which points to inactive right s1 (l5) radiculopathy. there's no evidence of left lower extremity radiculopathy, peripheral neuropathy, or entrapment neuropathy. we'll schedule imaging studies tomorrow to get more details on your condition.
[patient] okay, thank you, doc.",4
"EXAM:
Left heart cath, selective coronary angiogram, right common femoral angiogram, and StarClose closure of right common femoral artery.
REASON FOR EXAM:
Abnormal stress test and episode of shortness of breath.
PROCEDURE:
Right common femoral artery, 6-French sheath, JL4, JR4, and pigtail catheters were used.
FINDINGS:
1.  Left main is a large-caliber vessel.  It is angiographically free of disease,,2.  LAD is a large-caliber vessel.  It gives rise to two diagonals and septal perforator.  It erupts around the apex.  LAD shows an area of 60% to 70% stenosis probably in its mid portion.  The lesion is a type A finishing before the takeoff of diagonal 1.  The rest of the vessel is angiographically free of disease.
3.  Diagonal 1 and diagonal 2 are angiographically free of disease.
4.  Left circumflex is a small-to-moderate caliber vessel, gives rise to 1 OM.  It is angiographically free of disease.
5.  OM-1 is angiographically free of disease.
6.  RCA is a large, dominant vessel, gives rise to conus, RV marginal, PDA and one PL.  RCA has a tortuous course and it has a 30% to 40% stenosis in its proximal portion.
7.  LVEDP is measured 40 mmHg.
8.  No gradient between LV and aorta is noted.
Due to contrast concern due to renal function, no LV gram was performed.
Following this, right common femoral angiogram was performed followed by StarClose closure of the right common femoral artery.
IMPRESSION:
1.  60% to 70% mid left anterior descending stenosis.
2.  Mild 30% to 40% stenosis of the proximal right coronary artery.
3.  Status post StarClose closure of the right common femoral artery.
PLAN:
Plan will be to perform elective PCI of the mid LAD.","[doctor] hello! how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi. i am doing alright.
[doctor] i am glad to hear that. i have reviewed your exam and i see that you underwent a left heart cath, selective coronary angiogram, right common femoral angiogram, and starclose closure of right common femoral artery. what led you to have this exam?
[patient] well, i had an abnormal stress test result and i had an episode of shortness of breath.
[doctor] i see. during the exam, we found that your left main artery is large in caliber and angiographically free of disease. your left anterior descending artery, which is also a large-caliber vessel, shows an area of 60% to 70% stenosis, most likely in its mid portion. there is a mild 30% to 40% stenosis in the proximal right coronary artery. the rest of your vessels are angiographically free of disease. additionally, your lvedp was measured at 40 mmhg and no gradient between lv and aorta was noted.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] due to concern about contrast and your renal function, we did not perform an lv gram. we did perform a right common femoral angiogram followed by starclose closure of the right common femoral artery.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] based on these findings, our plan is to perform elective pci of the mid lad.
[patient] alright.
[doctor] do you have any questions or concerns?
[patient] no, i don't think so.
[doctor] alright. we will schedule your elective pci and i will give you all the necessary information before the procedure. if you experience any further symptoms before then, please let us know.","[doctor] hey there! how're you feeling today?
[patient] hey doc. i'm doing alright, thanks for asking.
[doctor] awesome! after reviewing your exam, i noticed that you had a left heart cath, selective coronary angiogram, right common femoral angiogram, and starclose closure of right common femoral artery. what made you decide to have this exam?
[patient] well, i had an abnormal stress test and had a shortness of breath episode.
[doctor] gotcha. during the exam, we found that your left main artery is good and free of disease. your left anterior descending artery, which is also a large vessel, has a little 60% to 70% blockage in its middle area. the proximal right coronary artery has a mild 30% to 40% blockage. the rest of your vessels are good. also, your lvedp was 40 mmhg and no gradient between lv and aorta was noted.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] because we were worried about your renal function, we didn't perform an lv gram. but we did do a right common femoral angiogram and starclose closure of the right common femoral artery.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] based on these findings, we're planning on doing an elective pci of the mid lad.
[patient] alright.
[doctor] any questions or concerns?
[patient] no, i don't think so.
[doctor] okay, we'll schedule your elective pci and give you all the necessary info before the procedure. if you feel any more symptoms before then, just let us know, okay?",4
"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 41-year-old registered nurse (R.N.).  She was admitted following an overdose of citalopram and warfarin.  The patient has had increasing depression and has been under stress as a result of dissolution of her second marriage.  She notes starting in January, her husband of five years seemed to be quite withdrawn.  It turned out, he was having an affair with one of her best friends and he subsequently moved in with this woman.  The patient is distressed, as over the five years of their marriage, she has gotten herself into considerable debt supporting him and trying to find a career that would work for him.  They had moved to ABCD where he had recently been employed as a restaurant manager.  She also moved her mother and son out there and is feeling understandably upset that he was being dishonest and deceitful with her.  She has history of seasonal affective disorder, winter depressions, characterized by increased sleep, increased irritability, impatience, and fatigue.  Some suggestion on her part that her father may have had some mild bipolar disorder and including the patient has a cyclical and recurrent mood disorder.  In January, she went on citalopram.  She reports since that time, she has lost 40 pounds of weight, has trouble sleeping at night, thinks perhaps her mood got worse on the citalopram, which is possible, though it is also possible that the progressive nature of getting divorce than financial problems has contributed to her worsening mood.
PAST AND DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY:
She was born in XYZ.  She describes the family as being somewhat dysfunctional.  Father was a truckdriver.  She is an only child.  She reports that she had a history of anorexia and bulimia as a teenager.  In her 20s, she served six years in Naval Reserve.  She was previously married for four years.  She described that as an abusive relationship.  She had a history of being in counseling with ABC, but does not think this therapist, who is now by her estimate 80 years old, is still in practice.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL:  This is an alert and cooperative woman.
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.1, pulse 60, respirations 18, blood pressure 95/54, oxygen saturation 95%, and weight is 132.
PSYCHIATRIC:  She makes good eye contact.  Speech is normal in rate, volume, grammar, and vocabulary.  There is no thought disorder.  She denies being suicidal.  Her affect is appropriate for material being discussed.  She has a sense of future, wants to get back to work, has plans to return to counseling.  She appeared to have normal orientation, concentration, memory, and judgment.
Medical history is notable for factor V Leiden deficiency, history of pulmonary embolus, restless legs syndrome.  She has been off her Mirapex.  I did encourage her to go back on the Mirapex, which would likely lead to some improvement in mood by facilitating better sleep.
The patient at this time can contract for safety.  She has made plans for outpatient counseling this Saturday and we will get a referral to a psychiatrist for which she is agreeable to following up with.
LABORATORY DATA:
INR, which is still 8.8.  In 1998, she had a normal MRI.  Electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, and CBC were all normal.
DIAGNOSES:
1.  Seasonal depressive disorder.
2.  Restless legs syndrome.
3.  Overdose of citalopram and warfarin.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
The patient reports she has been feeling better since discontinuing antidepressants.  I, therefore, recommend she stay off antidepressants at present.  If needed, she can take Prozac, which has been effective for her in the past and she plans to see a psychiatrist for consultation.  She does give a fairly good history of seasonal depression and given that her mood has improved in the past with Prozac, this will be an appropriate agent to try as needed in the future, but given the situational nature of the depression, she primarily appears to need counseling.
Please feel free to contact me at digital pager if there is additional information I can provide.","[doctor] hi, i'm dr. [name] and i'll be taking care of you. how are you feeling?
[patient] hi, i've been better.
[doctor] i can understand that. so, the nurse told me that you overdosed on citalopram and warfarin. can you tell me what happened?

[doctor] i see. i'm sorry to hear that. have you ever had any issues with depression in the past?
[patient] yes, i have seasonal affective disorder. i usually have increased sleep, irritability, impatience, and fatigue during the winters.
[doctor] okay. have you been in counseling before?
[patient] yes, i have, but my old therapist is no longer in practice.
[doctor] i see. well, i think it would be beneficial for you to continue with counseling. you mentioned that you have plans to go back to counseling this saturday, is that right?
[patient] yes, that's correct.
[doctor] great. i'll make sure to refer you to a psychiatrist who can help with your medication management. it sounds like prozac has worked well for you in the past, so i'll keep that in mind. in the meantime, i recommend that you stay off antidepressants unless absolutely necessary, since you mentioned feeling better after discontinuing them. and i'm glad to hear that you're already taking steps to take care of your mental health.
[patient] thank you.
[doctor] you're welcome. is there anything else you'd like to talk about or any questions you have for me?
[patient] no, i think that's all for now.
[doctor] alright. we'll keep an eye on your vital signs and run some additional tests, but for now, you can contract for safety, meaning you can assure us that you won't harm yourself. if you need anything, please don't hesitate to let us know.","[doctor] hi, i'm dr.

"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 53-year-old widowed woman, she lives at ABC Hotel.  She presented with a complaint of chest pain, evaluations revealed severe aortic stenosis.  She has been refusing cardiac catheter and she may well need aortic valve replacement.  She states that she does not want heart surgery or valve replacement.  She has a history of bipolar disorder and has been diagnosed at times with schizophrenia.  She is on Depakote 500 mg three times a day and Geodon 80 mg twice a day.  The patient receives mental health care through the XYZ Health System and there is a psychiatrist who makes rounds at the ABC Hotel.  She denies hallucinations, psychosis, paranoia, and suicidal ideation at this time.  States that she does not want surgery because the chest pain that was a presenting complaint has gone away that she did not feel her problem is severe enough to require surgery, and medical records does show in this obese individual that cardiac surgery would present substantial risks and for this individual with the chronic mental illness and behavioral problems of a chronic nature, surgery does present some additional risks.  The patient notes that she has a long history of substance abuse, primarily inhalation of paint vapors that she had more than 100 incarcerations in the XYZ County Jail related to offenses related to her lifestyle at that time such as shoplifting, violation of orders to abstain from substance abuse and the longest confinement of these was 100 days.
The patient is able to write a fairly reasonable explanation for why she does not want to pursue medical care.
PAST AND DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY:
She was born in XYZ.  She is a high-school graduate from ABCD High School.  She did have an abusive childhood.  She is married four times.  She notes she developed depression when a number of her children died.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL:
This is an obese woman in bed.  She is somewhat restless and moving during the interview.
VITAL SIGNS,:  Temperature of 97.3, pulse 70, respirations 18, blood pressure 113/68, and oxygen saturation 94% on 3 L of oxygen.
PSYCHIATRY:
Speech is normal, rate, volume, grammar, and vocabulary consistent with her educational level.  There is no overt thought disorder.  She does not appear psychotic.  She is not suicidal on formal testing.  She gives the date as Sunday, 05/19/2007 when it is the 20th and 207 when it is 2007.  She is oriented to place.  She can memorize four times, repeats two at five minutes, gets the other two with category hints, this places short-term memory in normal limits.  She had difficulty with serial three subtractions, counting on her fingers and had difficulty naming the months in reverse order stating, ""December, November, September, October, June, July, August, September,"" but recognizes this was not right and then said, ""March, April, May.""  She is able to name objects appropriately.
LABORATORY DATA:
Chest x-ray showing no acute changes.  Carotid duplex shows no stenosis.  Electrolytes and liver function tests are normal.  TSH normal.  Hematocrit 31%.  Triglycerides 152.
DIAGNOSES:
1.  Bipolar disorder, apparently stable on medications.
2.  Mild organic brain syndrome, presumably secondary to her chronic inhalant, paint, abuse.
3.  Aortic stenosis.
4.  Sleep apnea.
5.  Obesity.
6.  Anemia.
7.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
It is my impression at present that the patient retains ability to make decisions on her own behalf.  Given this lady's underlying mental problems, I would recommend that her treating physicians discuss her circumstances with physicians who round on her at the ABC Hotel.  While she may well need surgery and cardiac catheter, she may be more willing to accept this in the context of some continued encouragement from care providers who usually provide care for her.  She clearly at this time wants to leave this hospital; she normally gets her care through XYZ Health.  Again, in summary, I would consider her to retain the ability to make decisions on her own behalf.
Please feel free to contact me at digital pager if additional information is needed.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm okay, thanks.

[doctor] i understand. based on my assessment, you still have the ability to make decisions on your own behalf. however, given your underlying mental health problems, i recommend that your treating physicians discuss your circumstances with physicians who round on you at the abc hotel. they may be able to provide continued encouragement and support. it's important to address the aortic stenosis, but we also need to take into consideration your mental health and substance abuse history. do you have any questions or concerns?
[patient] no, not at this time.
[doctor] okay. please feel free to contact me if you need any further information or assistance.",4
"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 23-year-old married man who had an onset of aplastic anemia in December, underwent a bone marrow transplant in the end of March, has developed very severe graft-versus-host reaction.  Psychiatric consultation has been requested as the patient has been noncompliant with treatment, leave the unit, does not return when requested, and it was unclear as to whether this is secondary to confusion or willful behavior.
The patient gives a significant history of behavioral problems from late adolescence until the onset of illness, states he had lot of trouble with law, he was convicted of assault, he was also arrested with small amount of cannabis, states he served one year incarcerated in ABCD that was about two years ago.  Gives an ongoing history of substance abuse until one year ago when he went into a drug rehabilitation program, he was discharged from that on 05/28/2006 and states he has been clean and sober since then.  Prior to going to rehabilitation, he was using intravenous heroin couple of times a week since age 17, which would have been over a period of about five years, reports heavy use of cannabis, smoking pot up to five times a day if he could.  He would drink up to half of a fifth of rum on a daily basis when available.
The patient is currently on Lexapro 10 mg in the morning and diazepam 10 mg at bedtime.  He complained of some depressive and some anxiety symptoms, but these do not appear to be out of proportion to his medical issues and, for this individual, the frustrations of his treatments.  He would have a limited support system here in Colorado.  He married in January and states that the marriage is not going particularly well, being young, sick, and hospitalized, has not helped his relationship with his new wife who apparently is expecting a child in July.  I would recommend some couples counseling as a part of their treatment here.
The patient was fairly drowsy during the interview and full past and developmental history was not obtained.  The patient's comment is that he grew up all over, that his parents had separated, that he lived with his mother, that he dropped out of school in eleventh grade, at that time was living in XYZ area because he did not like school.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL:
This is a cooperative man, speech is soft and difficult to understand.  There is no thought disorder and no hallucination.  He denies being suicidal, but does express at times feelings about giving up on his treatments and primarily complaints about feeling that he is treated like a child and confined in the hospital.
VITAL SIGNS:
Temperature 97.2, pulse 117, respirations 16, blood pressure 127/74, oxygen saturation 97%, and weight is 154 pounds.
PSYCHIATRY:
There is no thought disorder, no paranoia, no delusions, and no psychotic symptoms.  Activities of daily living (ADLs) appear intact.  On formal testing, he is oriented to place.  He can give a reasonable recitation of his medical history.  He is oriented to the year, knows it is the 15th, but gave the month as June instead of May.  He can memorize four items, repeats three out of four at five minutes, gives the fourth through the category, which places short-term memory in normal limits.  He can do serial three subtractions accurately, can name objects appropriately.
LABORATORY DATA:
Sodium of 135, BUN of 24, and glucose 119.  GGT of 355, ALT of 97, LDH of 703, and alk phos of 144.  FK506 is 28.8, which is elevated tacrolimus level.  Hematocrit 29% and white count is 7000.
DIAGNOSES:
AXIS I:
Depressive disorder secondary to the underlying medical condition of graft-versus-host reaction.
AXIS II:
Personality disorder, not otherwise specified (NOS).
AXIS III:
History of polysubstance abuse, in remission.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  This patient appears to retain the ability to make decisions on his own behalf.  I think he is mentally competent.  Unfortunately, his impulsive low frustration personality dynamics do not fit well with the demands and requirements for treatment of this chronic illness.  If the patient refuses treatment, he understands that the consequences of this would likely be hastened mortality and he does state that he does not want to die.
2.  The patient does complain of depressed mood, also of anxiety.  We did discuss medications.  He appeared somewhat sedated at the time of my interview.  I would recommend that we try Seroquel 25 mg twice daily on an as-needed basis to see if this diminishes anxiety.  I will have Dr. X followup with him.
Please feel free to contact me at digital pager if additional information is needed.
My overall recommendation would be that the patient be on some random urine drug screening, that he use cell phone if he goes off the unit, to be called back up when treatments are scheduled, and hopefully he will be agreeable to complying with this.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?

"FINAL DIAGNOSES:
Delivered pregnancy, cholestasis of pregnancy, fetal intolerance to labor, failure to progress.
PROCEDURE:
Included primary low transverse cesarean section.
SUMMARY:
This 32-year-old gravida 2 was induced for cholestasis of pregnancy at 38-1/2 weeks.  The patient underwent a 2-day induction.  On the second day, the patient continued to progress all the way to the point of 9.5 cm at which point, she failed to progress.  During the hour or two of evaluation at 9.5 cm, the patient was also noted to have some fetal tachycardia and an occasional late deceleration.  Secondary to these factors, the patient was brought to the operative suite for primary low transverse cesarean section, which she underwent without significant complication.  There was a slightly enlarged blood loss at approximately 1200 mL, and postoperatively, the patient was noted to have a very mild tachycardia coupled with 100.3 degrees Fahrenheit temperature right at delivery.  It was felt that this was a sign of very early chorioamnionitis and therapeutic antibiotics were given throughout her stay.  The patient received 72 hours of antibiotics with there never being a temperature above 100.3 degrees Fahrenheit.  The maternal tachycardia resolved within a day.  The patient did well throughout the 3-day stay progressing to full diet, regular bowel movements, normal urination patterns.  The patient did receive 2 units of packed red cells on Sunday when attended to by my partner secondary to a hematocrit of 20%.  It should be noted, however, that this was actually an expected result with the initial hematocrit of 32% preoperatively.  Therefore, there was anemia but not an unexplained anemia.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:
Includes the stable vital signs, afebrile state.  An alert and oriented patient who is desirous at discharge.  Full range of motion, all extremities; fully ambulatory.  Pulse is regular and strong.  Lungs are clear and the abdomen is soft and nontender with minimal tympany and a nontender fundus.  The incision is beautiful and soft and nontender.  There is scant lochia and there is minimal edema.
LABORATORY STUDIES:
Include hematocrit of 27% and the last liver function tests was within normal limits 48 hours prior to discharge.
FOLLOWUP:
For the patient includes pelvic rest, regular diet.  Follow up with me in 1 to 2 weeks.  Motrin 800 mg p.o. q.8h. p.r.n. cramps, Tylenol No.  3 one p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain, prenatal vitamin one p.o. daily, and topical triple antibiotic to incision b.i.d. to q.i.d.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?

[doctor] that's great to hear. i just wanted to go over your discharge instructions with you. so, you had a primary low transverse cesarean section due to fetal intolerance to labor and failure to progress. we also noted that you had cholestasis of pregnancy. you did receive 72 hours of antibiotics while in the hospital due to a mild fever and tachycardia at delivery, which was a sign of early chorioamnionitis. how have you been feeling since then?
[patient] i've been feeling okay. no fever or anything like that.
[doctor] good. on physical examination, everything looks good. your vital signs are stable, you have a regular and strong pulse, and your incision is beautiful and soft. you also have minimal edema. your laboratory studies show a hematocrit of 27%, which is expected since you received 2 units of packed red cells due to anemia. your liver function tests were within normal limits prior to discharge. for follow-up, i want you to maintain regular pelvic rest and a regular diet. you can take motrin 800 mg every 8 hours as needed for cramps and tylenol no. 3 every 4 hours as needed for pain. additionally, i want you to take a prenatal vitamin once a day and apply topical triple antibiotic to your incision twice a day to four times a day. it's also important that you follow up with me in one to two weeks. do you have any questions or concerns?

"REASON FOR VISIT:
The patient is a 38-year-old woman with pseudotumor cerebri without papilledema who comes in because of new onset of headaches.  She comes to clinic by herself.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Dr. X has cared for her since 2002.  She has a Codman-Hakim shunt set at 90 mmH2O.  She last saw us in clinic in January 2008 and at that time we recommended that she followup with Dr. Y for medical management of her chronic headaches.  We also recommended that the patient see a psychiatrist regarding her depression, which she stated that she would followup with that herself.  Today, the patient returns to clinic because of acute onset of headaches that she has had since her shunt was adjusted after an MRI on 04/18/08.  She states that since that time her headaches have been bad.  They woke her up at night.  She has not been able to sleep.  She has not had a good sleep cycle since that time.  She states that the pain is constant and is worse with coughing, straining, and sneezing as well as on standing up.  She states that they feel a little bit better when lying down.  Medication shave not helped her.  She has tried taking Imitrex as well as Motrin 800 mg twice a day, but she states it has not provided much relief.  The pain is generalized, but also noted to be quite intense in the frontal region of her head.  She also reports ringing in the ears and states that she just does not feel well.  She reports no nausea at this time.  She also states that she has been experiencing intermittent blurry vision and dimming lights as well.  She tells me that she has an appointment with Dr. Y tomorrow.  She reports no other complaints at this time.
MAJOR FINDINGS:
On examination today, this is a pleasant 38-year-old woman who comes back from the clinic waiting area without difficulty.  She is well developed, well nourished, and kempt.
Vital Signs:  Blood pressure 153/86, pulse 63, and respiratory rate 16.
Cranial Nerves:  Intact for extraocular movements.  Facial movement, hearing, head turning, tongue, and palate movements are all intact.  I did not know any papilledema on exam bilaterally.
I examined her shut site, which is clean, dry, and intact.  She did have a small 3 mm to 4 mm round scab, which was noted farther down from her shunt reservoir.  It looks like there is a little bit of dry blood there.
ASSESSMENT:
The patient appears to have had worsening headaches since shunt adjustment back after an MRI.
PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:
1.  Pseudotumor cerebri without papilledema.
2.  Migraine headaches.
PROCEDURES:
I programmed her shunt to 90 mmH2O.
PLAN:
It was noted that the patient began to have an acute onset of headache pain after her shunt adjustment approximately a week and a half ago.  I had programmed her shunt back to 90 mmH2O at that time and confirmed it with an x-ray.  However, the picture of the x-ray was not the most desirable picture.  Thus, I decided to reprogram the shunt back to 90 mmH2O today and have the patient return to Sinai for a skull x-ray to confirm the setting at 90.  In addition, she told me that she is scheduled to see Dr. Y tomorrow, so she should followup with him and also plan on contacting the Wilmer Eye Institute to setup an appointment.  She should followup with the Wilmer Eye Institute as she is complaining of blurry vision and dimming of the lights occasionally.
Total visit time was approximately 60 minutes and about 10 minutes of that time was spent in counseling the patient.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, doctor. i'm feeling really bad. i've been having headaches since my shunt was adjusted after an mri.
[doctor] i see. can you tell me more about the pain? how long does it last, and where do you feel it?
[patient] the pain is constant and is worse when i cough, strain, and sneeze. it's also more intense in the frontal region of my head. it's been about a week and a half now, and i can't sleep well because of the pain. i have also been experiencing ringing in my ears and some intermittent blurry vision.
[doctor] i understand. i examined your shunt site, and it looks clean and dry. i also checked your cranial nerves and found no papilledema. i will program your shunt back to 90 mmh2o and have you return to sinai for a skull x-ray to confirm the setting at 90. you should also follow up with dr. y tomorrow, and contact the wilmer eye institute to schedule an appointment since you've been experiencing blurry vision and dimming of the lights.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?

"REASON FOR VISIT:
This is a new patient evaluation for Mr. A. There is a malignant meningioma.  He is referred by Dr. X.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
He said he has had two surgeries in 07/06 followed by radiation and then again in 08/07.  He then had a problem with seizures, hemiparesis, has been to the hospital, developed C-diff, and is in the nursing home currently.  He is unable to stand at the moment.  He is unable to care for himself.
I reviewed the information that was sent down with him from the nursing home which includes his medical history.
MEDICATIONS:
Keppra 1500 twice a day and Decadron 6 mg four times a day.  His other medicines include oxycodone, an aspirin a day, Prilosec, Dilantin 300 a day, and Flagyl.
FINDINGS:
On examination, he is lying on the stretcher.  He has oxygen on and has periods of spontaneous hyperventilation.  He is unable to lift his right arm or right leg.  He has an expressive dysphasia and confusion.
I reviewed the imaging studies from summer from the beginning of 10/07, end of 10/07 as well as the current MRI he had last week.  This shows that he has had progression of disease with recurrence along the surface of the brain and there is significant brain edema.  This is a malignant meningioma by diagnosis.
ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
In summary, Mr. A has significant disability and is not independent currently.  I believe that because of this that the likelihood of benefit from surgery is small and there is a very good chance that he would not be able to recover from surgery.  I do not think that surgery will help his quality of life and a need to control the tumor would be dependent on another therapy impacting the tumor.  Given that there are not good therapies and chemotherapy would be the option at the moment, and he certainly is not in a condition where chemotherapy would be given, I believe that surgery would not be in his best interest.  I discussed this both with him, although it is not clear to me how much he understood, as well as his family.","[doctor] hello, mr. a. how are you feeling today?

[patient] yeah, so i have been experiencing this thing called progressive anterograde amnesia for the past year. i can't remember anything from one minute to the next. and, uh, i also have some retrograde memory loss, which makes it difficult for me to remember the names of my grandchildren.
[doctor] got it. have you had any other symptoms or medical issues in the past?
[patient] yeah, i have cad, mi x2, pvd, and htn. i've also had bilateral inguinal hernia repair in the past.
[doctor] i see. and what about your family history? have any of your family members experienced similar symptoms?
[patient] well, my mother died of a stroke at age 58, and my father had cad and htn.
[doctor] okay. we will need to run some tests to determine the cause of your symptoms. we will start with an mri of your brain to check for any abnormalities.
[patient] mm-hmm, okay, doctor.
[doctor] the results of your mri show increased signal on t2 weighted images in the mesiotemporal lobes bilaterally, which could be a sign of limbic encephalitis. we will need to do more testing to determine the cause of this.
[patient] alright, what can be done to treat it?
[doctor] the treatment will depend on the underlying cause. we will need to do more testing to determine the cause first. in the meantime, we can prescribe medication to help with your symptoms.
[patient] okay, thank you, doctor.
[doctor] you're welcome. we will continue to monitor your condition and do whatever we can to help you feel better.",4
"REASON FOR VISIT:
Ms. ABC is a 67-year-old woman with adult hydrocephalus who returns to clinic for a routine evaluation.  She comes to clinic by herself.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
She has been followed for her hydrocephalus since 2002.  She also had an anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion from C3 though C5 in March 2007.  She was last seen by us in clinic in March 2008 and she was experiencing little bit of head fullness and ringing in the ears at that time; however, we decided to leave her shunt setting at 1.0.  We wanted her to followup with Dr. XYZ regarding the MRI of the cervical spine.  Today, she tells me that with respect to her bladder last week she had some episodes of urinary frequency, however, this week she is not experiencing the same type of episodes.  She reports no urgency, incontinence, and feels that she completely empties her bladder when she goes.  She does experience some leakage with coughing.  She wears the pad on a daily basis.  She does not think that her bladder has changed much since we saw her last.  With respect to her thinking and memory, she reports no problems at this time.  She reports no headaches at this time.  With respect to her walking and balance, she says that it feels worse.  In the beginning of May, she had a coughing spell and at that time she developed buttock pain, which travels down the legs.  She states that her leg often feel like elastic and she experiences a tingling radiculopathy.  She says that this tingling is constant and at times painful.  She feels that she is walking slower for this reason.  She does not use the cane at this time.  Most of the time, she is able to walk over uneven surfaces.  She is able to walk up and down stairs and has no trouble getting in and out of a car.
MEDICATIONS:
Rhinocort 32 mg two sprays a day, Singulair 10 mg once a day, Xyzal 5 mg in the morning, Spiriva once a day, Advair twice a day, Prevacid 30 mg twice a day, Os-Cal 500 mg once a day, multivitamin once a day, and aspirin 81 mg a day.
MAJOR FINDINGS:
On exam today, this is a pleasant 67-year-old woman who comes back from the clinic waiting area with little difficulty.  She is well developed, well nourished, and kempt.
The shunt site is clean, dry, and intact and confirmed at a setting of 1.0.
Mental Status:  Assessed and appears intact for orientation, recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, language, and fund of knowledge.  Her Mini-Mental Status exam score was 26/30 when attention was tested with calculations and 30/30 when attention was tested with spelling.
Cranial Nerves:  Extraocular movements are somewhat inhibited.  She does not display any nystagmus at this time.  Facial movement, hearing, head turning, tongue, and palate movement are all intact.
Gait:  Assessed using the Tinetti assessment tool, which showed a balance score of 13/16 and a gait score of 11/12 for a total score of 24/28.
ASSESSMENT:
Ms. ABC has been experiencing difficulty with walking over the past several months.
PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:
1.  Hydrocephalus.
2.  Cervical stenosis and retrolisthesis.
3.  Neuropathy in the legs.
PLAN:
Before we recommend anything more, we would like to get a hold of the notes from Dr. XYZ to try to come up with a concrete plan as to what we can do next for Ms. ABC.  We believe that her walking is most likely not being effected by the hydrocephalus.  We would like to see her back in clinic in two and a half months or so.  We also talked to her about having her obtain cane training so that she knows how to properly use her cane, which she states she does have one.  I suggested that she use the cane at her on discretion.","[doctor] hi ms. abc, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hello doctor, i am doing alright.
[doctor] that's good to hear. i see that you are here for a routine evaluation. can you tell me how you have been feeling since we last saw you?
[patient] yes, i have been experiencing some tingling and pain in my legs since may. i also feel like my walking and balance has been worse.
[doctor] i see. have you noticed any changes in your bladder function?
[patient] last week i had some episodes of urinary frequency, but this week it seems to be better. i have no urgency or incontinence.
[doctor] okay, that's good to know. i see that you have been on several medications. are you taking them regularly?
[patient] yes, i take them as prescribed.
[doctor] great. during the exam, i checked your shunt and it appears to be functioning properly. your mental status also appears to be intact. however, i did notice some extraocular movement inhibition.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] based on your symptoms and exam findings, we believe that your difficulty with walking is not related to your hydrocephalus. we will need to review your notes from dr. xyz to come up with a plan for your cervical stenosis and retrolisthesis. we would also like to see you back in clinic in two and a half months to monitor your progress. in the meantime, we recommend that you obtain cane training to properly use your cane for support when needed. do you have any questions or concerns?
[patient] no, that all sounds good. thank you, doctor.
[doctor] you're welcome, ms. abc. please take care and we will see you back in clinic soon.","[doctor] hi ms. abc, how are you feeling today?

"FINAL DIAGNOSIS/REASON FOR ADMISSION:
1.  Acute right lobar pneumonia.
2.  Hypoxemia and hypotension secondary to acute right lobar pneumonia.
3.  Electrolyte abnormality with hyponatremia and hypokalemia - corrected.
4.  Elevated liver function tests, etiology undetermined.
5.  The patient has a history of moderate-to-severe dementia, Alzheimer's type.
6.  Anemia secondary to current illness and possible iron deficiency.
7.  Darkened mole on the scalp, status post skin biopsy, pending pathology report.
OPERATION AND PROCEDURE:
The patient underwent a scalp skin biopsy with pathology specimen obtained on 6/11/2009.  Dr. X performed the procedure, thoracentesis on 6/12/2009 both diagnostic and therapeutic.  Dr. Y's results pending.
DISPOSITION:
The patient discharged to long-term acute facility under the care of Dr. Z.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:
Clinically improved, however, requiring acute care.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
Include those on admission combined with IV Flagyl 500 mg every 8 hours and Levaquin 500 mg daily.
HOSPITAL SUMMARY:
This is one of several admissions for this 68-year-old female who over the initial 48 hours preceding admission had a complaint of low-grade fever, confusion, dizziness, and a nonproductive cough.  Her symptoms progressed and she presented to the emergency room at Brighton Gardens where a chest x-ray revealed evolving right lobar infiltrate.  She was started on antibiotics.  Infectious Disease was consulted.  She was initially begun on vancomycin.  Blood, sputum, and urine cultures were obtained; the results of which were negative for infection.  She was switched to IV Levaquin and received IV Flagyl for possible C. diff colitis as well as possible cholecystitis.  During her hospital stay, she initially was extremely relatively hypotensive with mild symptoms and she became dizzy with upright positioning.  Her systolic blood pressure was 60-70 mmHg despite rather aggressive IV fluid management up to 250 mL an hour.  She was seen in consultation by Dr. Y who monitored her fluid and pulmonary treatment.  Due to some elevated liver function tests, she was seen in consultation by Dr. X.  An ultrasound was negative; however, she did undergo CT scan of the chest and abdomen and there was a suspicion of fluid circling the gallbladder.  A HIDA scan was performed and revealed no evidence of gallbladder dysfunction.  Liver functions were monitored throughout her stay and while elevated, did reduce to approximately 1.5 times normal value.  She also was seen in consultation by Infectious Disease who followed her for several days and agreed with current management of antibiotics.  Over her week-stay, the patient was moderately hypoxemic with room air pulse oximetry of 90%.  She was placed on incentive spirometry and over the succeeding days, she did have improved pulmonary function.
LABORATORY TESTS:
Initially revealed a white count of 13,000, however, approximately 24 hours following admission her white count stabilized and in fact remained normal throughout her stay.  Blood cultures were negative at 5 days.  Sputum culture was negative.  Urine culture was negative and thoracentesis culture negative at 24 hours.  The patient did receive 2 units of packed red cells with the hemoglobin drop to 9 for cardiovascular support, as no evidence of GI bleeding was obtained.  Her most recent blood work on 6/14/2009 revealed a white count of 7000 and hemoglobin of 12.1 with a hematocrit of 36.8.  Her PT and PTT were normal.  Occult blood studies were negative for occult blood.  Hepatitis B antigen was negative.  Hepatitis A antibody IgM was negative.  Hepatitis B core IgM negative, and hepatitis C core antibody was negative.  At the time of discharge on 6/14/2009, sodium was 135, potassium was 3.7, calcium was 8.0, her ALT was 109, AST was 70, direct bilirubin was 0.2, LDH was 219, serum iron was 7, total iron unbound 183, and ferritin level was 267.
At the time of discharge, the patient had improved.  She complained of some back discomfort and lumbosacral back x-ray did reveal some evidence of mild degenerative disk disease with no obvious compression fracture acute noted and she will be followed by Dr. Z.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i am feeling okay, thank you.
[doctor] i am glad to hear that. i am dr. x and i was your physician during your stay at the hospital. i just wanted to go over your medical history with you and discuss your current medications.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] you were admitted to the hospital with acute right lobar pneumonia which caused hypoxemia and hypotension. you also had electrolyte abnormalities with hyponatremia and hypokalemia which were corrected. in addition, you had elevated liver function tests and anemia. you also had a darkened mole on your scalp which was biopsied, and the results are pending.
[patient] oh, i see.
[doctor] you were started on antibiotics for the pneumonia and were given iv flagyl and levaquin. your liver function tests were monitored and showed improvement over time. you also received two units of packed red cells for cardiovascular support.

"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
In short, the patient is a 55-year-old gentleman with long-standing morbid obesity, resistant to nonsurgical methods of weight loss with BMI of 69.7 with comorbidities of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, possible sleep apnea, and also osteoarthritis of the lower extremities.  He is also an ex-smoker.  He is currently smoking and he is planning to quit and at least he should do this six to eight days before for multiple reasons including decreasing the DVT, PE rates and marginal ulcer problems after surgery, which will be discussed later on.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
On physical examination today, he weighs 514.8 pounds, he has gained 21 pounds since the last visit with us.  His pulse is 78, temperature is 97.5, blood pressure is 132/74.  Lungs are clear.  He is a pleasant gentleman with stigmata of supermorbid obesity expected of his size.  Abdomen is soft, nontender.  No incisions.  No umbilical hernia, no groin hernia, has a large abdominal pannus.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  Lower extremities; no pedal edema.  No calf tenderness.  Deep tendon reflexes are normal.  Lungs are clear.  S1, S2 is heard.  Regular rate and rhythm.
DISCUSSION:
I had a long talk with the patient about laparoscopic gastric bypass possible open including risks, benefits, alternatives, need for long-term followup, need to adhere to dietary and exercise guidelines.  I also explained to him complications including rare cases of death secondary to DVT, PE, leak, peritonitis, sepsis shock, multisystem organ failure, need for reoperations, need for endoscopy for bleeding or leak, operations which could be diagnostic laparoscopy, exploratory laparotomy, drainage procedure, gastrostomy, jejunostomy for feeding, bleeding requiring blood transfusion, myocardial infarction, pneumonia, atelectasis, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, rarely tracheostomy, rare cases of renal failure requiring dialysis, etc.
were all discussed.
All these are going to be at high risk for this patient secondary to his supermorbid obese condition.
I also explained to him specific gastric bypass related complications including gastrojejunal stricture requiring endoscopic dilatation, marginal ulcer secondary to smoking or antiinflammatory drug intake, which can progress on to perforation or bleeding, small bowel obstruction secondary to internal hernia or adhesions, signs and symptoms of which are described, so the patient could alert us for earlier intervention, symptomatic gallstone formation during rapid weight loss, how to avoid it by taking ursodiol, which will be prescribed in the postoperative period.
Long-term complication of gastric bypass including hair loss, excess skin, multivitamin and mineral deficiencies, protein-calorie malnutrition, weight regain, weight plateauing, psychosocial and marital issues, addiction transfer, etc.
were all discussed with the patient.  The patient is at higher risk than usual set of patients secondary to his supermorbid obesity of BMI nearing 70 and also major cardiopulmonary and metabolic comorbidities.  Smoking of course does not help and increase the risk for cardiopulmonary complications and is at increased risk for cardiac risk.  He will be seen by cardiologist, pulmonologist.  He will also undergo long Medifast dieting under our guidance, which is a very low-calorie diet to decrease the size of the liver and also to optimize his cardiopulmonary and metabolic comorbidities.  He will also see a psychologist, nutritionist, and exercise physiologist in preparation for surgery for a multidisciplinary approach for short and long-term success.
Especially for him in view of his restricted mobility, supermorbid obesity status, and possibility of a pulmonary hypertension secondary to sleep apnea, he has been advised to have retrievable IVC filter and also will go home on Lovenox.  He also needs to start exercising to increase his flexibility and muscle tone before surgery and also to start getting the habit of doing so.  All these were discussed with the patient.  The patient understands.  He wants to go to surgery.  All questions were answered.  I will see him in few weeks before the planned date of surgery.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm okay, thank you.
[doctor] so, i understand that you are planning to quit smoking before your surgery. that's great. just to let you know, quitting smoking at least six to eight days before surgery can lower the risk of complications such as dvt, pe rates and marginal ulcer problems. 
[patient] okay, i'll definitely quit before surgery.
[doctor] that's good to hear. i also want to discuss with you a little bit about the surgery itself. we talked about the possibility of laparoscopic gastric bypass, and even open surgery, but there are risks and benefits to consider. 
[patient] yes, you explained it to me last time. 
[doctor] yes, i just want to make sure you understand that there are specific complications related to gastric bypass surgery, such as gastrojejunal stricture, marginal ulcer, small bowel obstruction, gallstone formation, and other long-term complications. i also want to remind you that you are at a higher risk of complications due to your super morbid obese condition, and your major cardiopulmonary and metabolic comorbidities. so, we have a multidisciplinary team in place to help you prepare, including a cardiologist, pulmonologist, psychologist, nutritionist, and exercise physiologist. 
[patient] okay, i understand. 
[doctor] great. we also discussed that you need to start exercising to increase your flexibility and muscle tone before surgery to help with your recovery. i also want to remind you that you will need a retrievable ivc filter and will go home on lovenox. 
[patient] okay, i'll make sure to follow all the instructions you give me. 
[doctor] that's great to hear. we will work together to ensure that everything goes smoothly. i will see you again in a few weeks before the planned date of surgery.","[doctor] hey, how's it going? feeling alright today?
[patient] um, yeah, i'm doing alright, thanks.
[doctor] so, i heard you want to kick the smoking habit before your surgery. that's awesome! just want to give you a heads up that stopping smoking at least six to eight days before the surgery can help reduce the risk of complications, like dvt, pe, and stomach ulcers. 
[patient] mm-hmm, got it. i'll definitely quit before surgery.
[doctor] sweet! now, let's talk a little bit about the surgery itself. we discussed the possibility of laparoscopic gastric bypass or open surgery, but i want to make sure you're aware of the risks and benefits of each. 
[patient] yeah, you already talked to me about that last time.
[doctor] right, right. i just want to make sure you know about the specific complications that can come with gastric bypass surgery, like gastrojejunal stricture, stomach ulcers, bowel obstruction, gallstones, and other long-term difficulties. also, because of your super morbid obesity, as well as your major cardiopulmonary and metabolic conditions, you're at higher risk for complications. that's why we've got a whole team lined up to help you prep for the surgery - a cardiologist, pulmonologist, psychologist, nutritionist, and exercise physiologist. 
[patient] okay, i'm following you.
[doctor] awesome! we also talked about how important it is for you to start exercising to build up your muscles and flexibility before the surgery, which will help with recovery. and, just a reminder, you'll need a retrievable ivc filter and will go home on lovenox. 
[patient] got it, i'll make sure to do everything you tell me to.
[doctor] perfect! we're working together to make sure everything goes smoothly. i'll check in with you again in a few weeks before the surgery date.",4
"INDICATIONS:
An 82-year-old man entering the cardiac rehabilitation program 6 weeks after a porcine aortic valve replacement and single-vessel coronary bypass graft procedure.  The patient has had a complicated postoperative course with rapid atrial fibrillation, pleural effusions, anemia and thrombocytopenia.  He is currently stabilized and improving in strength.  He is living in Nantucket with his daughter Debra Anderson while he recuperates and completes the cardiac rehabilitation program.  He has a few other significant medical problems.
MEDICATIONS:
1.  Toprol-XL 25 mg daily.
2.  Simvastatin 80 mg daily.
3.  Aspirin 81 mg daily.
4.  Synthroid 0.5 mg daily.
5.  Warfarin 1.5 mg daily.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
The patient appears pale and fragile.  He is comfortable at rest.  His resting heart rate is 80.  His resting blood pressure is 112/70.  His conjunctivae are pale.  His lungs have decreased breath sounds throughout and dullness at the bases bilaterally.  Heart exam reveals a distant S1 and S2.  There is a short 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.  The extremities are normal without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
The resting echocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm at 70 beats per minute.  There is poor R wave progression across the pericardium and Q waves inferiorly.
DESCRIPTION:
The patient exercised according to the modified Bruce protocol stopping at 3 minutes and 20 seconds with fatigue and shortness of breath.  He did not experience chest pain with exercise.  He did achieve a maximal heart rate of 100, which is 72% of his maximal predicted heart rate.  His maximal blood pressure was 190/70 resulting in a double product of 19,000 and achieving 2.3 METS.  As noted, the resting electrocardiogram had inferior Q waves and poor R wave progression.  There were no significant ST segment changes with exercise.  There were only rare ventricular premature beats with exercise.
CONCLUSION:
1.  Poor exercise capacity 6 weeks following an aortic valve replacement and single-vessel bypass procedure.
2.  No chest pain with exercise.
3.  No significant ECG changes with exercise.
4.  The patient is considered stable to enter our cardiac rehabilitation program.  I recommend the patient have a complete blood count, basic metabolic profile, and TSH obtained prior to entering the rehab program.","[doctor] hello, sir. how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm feeling alright, just a little tired.
[doctor] i understand. you've had a complicated postoperative course, but i'm glad to see that you're stabilized and improving in strength. so, you're here to enter our cardiac rehabilitation program?
[patient] yes, that's correct.
[doctor] great. before we start, i'd like to ask about your exercise capacity. how have you been feeling lately?
[patient] well, i get fatigued easily and have shortness of breath, but no chest pain.
[doctor] okay, thank you for letting me know. during your recent exercise test, you stopped at 3 minutes and 20 seconds with fatigue and shortness of breath. you did not experience any chest pain, which is good. you achieved a maximal heart rate of 100, which is 72% of your maximal predicted heart rate. your maximal blood pressure was 190/70, resulting in a double product of 19,000 and achieving 2.3 mets. does that sound about right?
[patient] yes, that's what i remember.
[doctor] good. based on your exercise test and physical examination, i believe you have poor exercise capacity 6 weeks following an aortic valve replacement and single-vessel bypass procedure. however, there were no significant ecg changes with exercise, and you only had rare ventricular premature beats. you're considered stable to enter our cardiac rehabilitation program.
[patient] that's good to hear.
[doctor] before we start, i recommend you have a complete blood count, basic metabolic profile, and tsh obtained. we need to make sure everything is in order before beginning the program. do you have any questions for me?
[patient] no, i don't think so.
[doctor] alright then, let's get those tests done and start you on the cardiac rehab program. we'll help you regain your strength and improve your exercise capacity.","[doctor] hello, sir. how are you feeling today?

"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
I have seen ABC today for her preoperative visit for weight management.  I have explained to her the need for Optifast for weight loss prior to these procedures to make it safer because of the large size of her liver.  She understands this.
IMPRESSION/PLAN:
We are going to put her on two weeks of Optifast at around 900 calories.  I have also explained the risks and potential complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy to her in detail including bleeding, infection, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, injury to the small intestine, stomach, liver, leak from the cystic duct, common bile duct, and possible need for ERCP and further surgery.  This surgery is going to be planned for October 6.  This is for cholelithiasis prior to her Lap-Banding procedure.
I have also reviewed with her the risks and potential complications of laparoscopic gastric banding including bleeding, infection, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, slippage of the band, erosion of the band, injury to the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, spleen, liver, injury to the band, port, or tubing necessitating replacement of the band, port, or tubing among other potential complications and she understands.  We are going to proceed for laparoscopic gastric banding.  I have reviewed her entire chart in detail.  I have also gone over with her the Fairfield County Bariatrics consent form for banding and all the risks.  She has also signed the St. Vincent's Hospital consent form for Lap-Banding.  She has taken the preoperative quiz for banding.  She has signed the preop and postop instructions, and understands them and we reviewed them.  She has taken the quiz and done fairly well.  We have reviewed with her any potential other issues and I have answered her questions.  She is planned for surgical intervention.

Due to his history of kidney stone, renal ultrasound as well as IVP was done.  He presents today for followup.  He denies any dysuria, gross hematuria or flank pain issues.  Last stone episode was over a year ago.  No history of smoking.  Daytime frequency 3 to 4 and nocturia 1 to 2, good stream, empties well with no incontinence.
Creatinine 1.0 on June 25, 2008, UA at that time was noted for 5-9 RBCs, renal ultrasound of 07/24/2008 revealed 6 mm left intrarenal stone, with no hydronephrosis.  IVP same day revealed a calcification over the left kidney, but without bilateral hydronephrosis.  The calcification previously noted on the ureter appears to be outside the course of the ureter.  Otherwise unremarkable.  This is discussed.

"PROCEDURE:
Upper endoscopy with removal of food impaction.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
A 92-year-old lady with history of dysphagia on and off for two years.  She comes in this morning with complaints of inability to swallow anything including her saliva.  This started almost a day earlier.  She was eating lunch and had beef stew and suddenly noticed inability to finish her meal and since then has not been able to eat anything.  She is on Coumadin and her INR is 2.5.
OPERATIVE NOTE:
Informed consent was obtained from patient.  The risks of aspiration, bleeding, perforation, infection, and serious risk including need for surgery and ICU stay particularly in view of food impaction for almost a day was discussed.  Daughter was also informed about the procedure and risks.  Conscious sedation initially was administered with Versed 2 mg and fentanyl 50 mcg.  The scope was advanced into the esophagus and showed liquid and solid particles from mid esophagus all the way to the distal esophagus.  There was a meat bolus in the distal esophagus.  This was visualized after clearing the liquid material and small particles of what appeared to be carrots.  The patient, however, was not tolerating the conscious sedation.  Hence, Dr. X was consulted and we continued the procedure with propofol sedation.
The scope was reintroduced into the esophagus after propofol sedation.  Initially a Roth net was used and some small amounts of soft food in the distal esophagus was removed with the Roth net.  Then, a snare was used to cut the meat bolus into pieces, as it was very soft.  Small pieces were grabbed with the snare and pulled out.  Thereafter, the residual soft meat bolus was passed into the stomach along with the scope, which was passed between the bolus and the esophageal wall carefully.  The patient had severe bruising and submucosal hemorrhage in the esophagus possibly due to longstanding bolus impaction and Coumadin therapy.  No active bleeding was seen.  There was a distal esophageal stricture, which caused slight resistance to the passage of the scope into the stomach.  As this area was extremely inflamed, a dilatation was not attempted.
IMPRESSION:
Distal esophageal stricture with food impaction.  Treated as described above.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
IV Protonix 40 mg q.12h.  Clear liquid diet for 24 hours.  If the patient is stable, thereafter she may take soft pureed diet only until next endoscopy, which will be scheduled in three to four weeks.  She should take Prevacid SoluTab 30 mg b.i.d. on discharge.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?
[patient] hello, doctor. i am feeling better now.
[doctor] i am glad to hear that. i reviewed your medical notes and it seems that you had a procedure - an upper endoscopy with removal of food impaction. can you tell me what led to that?
[patient] yes, i have been experiencing dysphagia on and off for two years. but recently, i was not able to swallow anything, including my saliva. i had beef stew for lunch and suddenly noticed that i was unable to finish my meal. since then, i have not been able to eat anything.
[doctor] i see. that must have been uncomfortable for you. do you take any medications?
[patient] yes, i take coumadin. i think my inr was 2.5 during the procedure.
[doctor] i see. during the procedure, a meat bolus was found in your distal esophagus. it was removed with the help of the roth net and snare. you were given conscious sedation initially but you were not tolerating it. so, we continued with propofol sedation. you might have some bruising and submucosal hemorrhage in the esophagus due to the food impaction and coumadin therapy. but no active bleeding was seen.
[patient] okay, thank you for explaining that to me.
[doctor] you're welcome. the impression shows a distal esophageal stricture with food impaction that was treated during the procedure. you will be given iv protonix 40 mg q.12h and a clear liquid diet for 24 hours. after 24 hours, you may take soft pureed diet only until your next endoscopy, which we will schedule in three to four weeks. you should take prevacid solutab 30 mg b.i.d. on discharge.

[doctor] that's great to hear! so, i was looking over your medical notes and it seems like you had a procedure done - an upper endoscopy with removal of food impaction. can you tell me a bit about what led to that?
[patient] yeah, sure. so, i've had trouble swallowing on and off for a couple of years, but recently it got really bad. i had some beef stew for lunch one day and suddenly couldn't swallow anything, not even my own saliva. since then, i haven't been able to eat anything at all.
[doctor] wow, that must have been tough. are you on any meds?
[patient] yeah, i take coumadin. i think my inr was 2.5 during the procedure.
[doctor] got it. during the procedure, we found a meat bolus in your distal esophagus. we used a roth net and snare to remove it with the help of conscious sedation at first, but you weren't tolerating it so we switched to propofol sedation. you might have some bruising and submucosal hemorrhage in the esophagus due to the food impaction and the coumadin, but there was no active bleeding.
[patient] okay, i see. thanks for breaking that down for me.
[doctor] no worries! the impression shows a distal esophageal stricture with food impaction that we were able to treat during the procedure. we'll give you iv protonix 40 mg q.12h and you'll be on a clear liquid diet for 24 hours. after that, you can have a soft pureed diet until your next endoscopy, which we're scheduling in three to four weeks. you should also take prevacid solutab 30 mg b.i.d. on discharge.

"PROCEDURE:
Urgent cardiac catheterization with coronary angiogram.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
The patient was brought urgently to the cardiac cath lab from the emergency room with the patient being intubated with an abnormal EKG and a cardiac arrest.  The right groin was prepped and draped in usual manner.  Under 2% lidocaine anesthesia, the right femoral artery was entered.  A 6-French sheath was placed.  The patient was already on anticoagulation.  Selective coronary angiograms were then performed using a left and a 3DRC catheter.  The catheters were reviewed.  The catheters were then removed and an Angio-Seal was placed.  There was some hematoma at the cath site.
RESULTS,1.  The left main was free of disease.
2.  The left anterior descending and its branches were free of disease.
3.  The circumflex was free of disease.
4.  The right coronary artery was free of disease.  There was no gradient across the aortic valve.
IMPRESSION:
Normal coronary angiogram.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Term pregnancy at 40 and 3/7th weeks.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
Spontaneous vaginal delivery.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 36-year-old African-American female who is a G-2, P-2-0-0-2 with an EDC of 08/30/2003.  She is blood type AB -ve with antibody screen negative and is also rubella immune, VDRL nonreactive, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, and HIV nonreactive.  She does have a history of sickle cell trait.  She presented to Labor and Delivery Triage at 40 and 3/7th weeks gestation with complaint of contractions every ten minutes.  She also stated that she has lost her mucous plug.  She did have fetal movement, noted no leak of fluid, did have some spotting.  On evaluation of triage, she was noted to be contracting approximately every five minutes and did have discomfort with her contractions.  She was evaluated by sterile vaginal exam and was noted to be 4 cm dilated, 70% effaced, and -3 station.  This was a change from her last office exam, at which she was 1 cm to 2 cm dilated.
PROCEDURE DETAILS:
The patient was admitted to Labor and Delivery for expected management of labor and AROM was performed and the amniotic fluid was noted to be meconium stained.  After her membranes were ruptured, contractions did increase to every two to three minutes as well as the intensity increased.  She was given Nubain for discomfort with good result.
She had a spontaneous vaginal delivery of a live born female at 11:37 with meconium stained fluid as noted from ROA position.  After controlled delivery of the head, tight nuchal cord was noted, which was quickly double clamped and cut and the shoulders and body were delivered without difficulty.  The infant was taken to the awaiting pediatrician.  Weight was 2870 gm, length was 51 cm.  The Apgars were 6 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes.  There was initial neonatal depression, which was treated by positive pressure ventilation and the administration of Narcan.
Spontaneous delivery of an intact placenta with a three-vessel cord was noted at 11:45.  On examination, there were no noted perineal abrasions or lacerations.  On vaginal exam, there were no noted cervical or vaginal sidewall lacerations.  Estimated blood loss was less than 250 cc.  Mother and infant are in recovery doing well at this time.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling?

"PROCEDURE:
Sigmoidoscopy.
INDICATIONS:
Performed for evaluation of anemia, gastrointestinal Bleeding.
MEDICATIONS:
Fentanyl (Sublazine) 0.1 mg IV Versed (midazolam) 1 mg IV,BIOPSIES:
No BRUSHINGS:
PROCEDURE:
A history and physical examination were performed.  The procedure, indications, potential complications (bleeding, perforation, infection, adverse medication reaction), and alternative available were explained to the patient who appeared to understand and indicated this.  Opportunity for questions was provided and informed consent obtained.  After placing the patient in the left lateral decubitus position, the sigmoidoscope was inserted into the rectum and under direct visualization advanced to 25 cm.  Careful inspection was made as the sigmoidoscope was withdrawn.  The quality of the prep was good.  The procedure was stopped due to patient discomfort.  The patient otherwise tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.
FINDINGS:
Was unable to pass scope beyond 25 cm because of stricture vs very short bends secondary to multiple previous surgeries.  Retroflexed examination of the rectum revealed small hemorrhoids.  External hemorrhoids were found.  Other than the findings noted above, the visualized colonic segments were normal.
IMPRESSION:
Internal hemorrhoids  External hemorrhoids  Unable to pass scope beyond 25 cm due either to stricture or very sharp bend secondary to multiple surgeries.  Unsuccessful Sigmoidoscopy.  Otherwise Normal Sigmoidoscopy to 25 cm.  External hemorrhoids were found.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after the sigmoidoscopy?
[patient] hi doctor, i'm feeling okay, a little bit uncomfortable.
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that. i just wanted to go over the results with you. during the procedure, we were able to visualize the sigmoid colon up to 25 cm. however, we were unable to pass the scope beyond that due to either a stricture or a bend caused by multiple previous surgeries. we did find internal and external hemorrhoids during the examination. 
[patient] okay, what does that mean?
[doctor] well, the inability to pass the scope beyond 25 cm means that we weren't able to complete the sigmoidoscopy. however, we were able to examine the sigmoid colon up to that point, and everything looked normal in that area. the hemorrhoids are a common finding and can be managed with medications and lifestyle modifications.
[patient] is there anything else i need to know?

This 78-year-old black woman has a history of hypertension, but no other cardiac problems. She noted complaints of fatigue, lightheadedness, and severe dyspnea on exertion. She was evaluated by her PCP on January 31st and her ECG showed sinus bradycardia with a rate of 37 beats per minute. She has had intermittent severe sinus bradycardia alternating with a normal sinus rhythm, consistent with sinoatrial exit block, and she is on no medications known to cause bradycardia. An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 70% without significant valvular heart disease.
PROCEDURE:
Implantation of a dual chamber permanent pacemaker.
APPROACH:
Left cephalic vein.
LEADS IMPLANTED:
Medtronic model 12345 in the right atrium, serial number 12345. Medtronic 12345 in the right ventricle, serial number 12345.
DEVICE IMPLANTED:
Medtronic EnRhythm model 12345, serial number 12345.
LEAD PERFORMANCE:
Atrial threshold less than 1.3 volts at 0.5 milliseconds. P wave 3.3 millivolts. Impedance 572 ohms. Right ventricle threshold 0.9 volts at 0.5 milliseconds. R wave 10.3. Impedance 855.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
20 mL.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
The patient was brought to the electrophysiology laboratory in a fasting state and intravenous sedation was provided as needed with Versed and fentanyl. The left neck and chest were prepped and draped in the usual manner and the skin and subcutaneous tissues below the left clavicle were infiltrated with 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia. A 2-1/2-inch incision was made below the left clavicle and electrocautery was used for hemostasis. Dissection was carried out to the level of the pectoralis fascia and extended caudally to create a pocket for the pulse generator. The deltopectoral groove was explored and a medium-sized cephalic vein was identified. The distal end of the vein was ligated and a venotomy was performed. Two guide wires were advanced to the superior vena cava and peel-away introducer sheaths were used to insert the two pacing leads. The venous pressures were elevated and there was a fair amount of back-bleeding from the vein, so a 3-0 Monocryl figure-of-eight stitch was placed around the tissue surrounding the vein for hemostasis. The right ventricular lead was placed in the high RV septum and the right atrial lead was placed in the right atrial appendage. The leads were tested with a pacing systems analyzer and the results are noted above. The leads were then anchored in place with #0-silk around their suture sleeve and connected to the pulse generator. The pacemaker was noted to function appropriately. The pocket was then irrigated with antibiotic solution and the pacemaker system was placed in the pocket. The incision was closed with two layers of 3-0 Monocryl and a subcuticular closure of 4-0 Monocryl. The incision was dressed with Steri-Strips and a sterile bandage and the patient was returned to her room in good condition.
IMPRESSION:
Successful implantation of a dual chamber permanent pacemaker via the left cephalic vein. The patient will be observed overnight and will go home in the morning.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling?
[patient] i feel better now, thank you.
[doctor] i'm glad to hear that. so, the procedure went well and we have implanted a dual chamber permanent pacemaker in your left cephalic vein.
[patient] okay, what does that mean exactly?
[doctor] it means that we have placed a device in your chest that will help regulate your heartbeat, as we found that you have had intermittent severe sinus bradycardia. this device will help maintain a normal rhythm.
[patient] okay, i understand now. what else can you tell me about the procedure?
[doctor] well, we used intravenous sedation with versed and fentanyl to keep you comfortable during the procedure. we made a small incision below your left clavicle and created a pocket for the pulse generator. we used a medium-sized cephalic vein to insert the two pacing leads which were then anchored to the pulse generator. the leads were tested with a pacing systems analyzer and the results were noted. the pocket was irrigated with antibiotic solution and closed up with stitches. your estimated blood loss was only about 20 ml, and there were no complications.
[patient] that sounds very technical, but i'm glad everything went well. is there anything i should expect now that the pacemaker is implanted?
[doctor] you will be observed overnight and you should be able to go home in the morning. you will have some restrictions on certain activities for a few weeks, but we will go over those with you before you leave. you will also need to come back for follow-up appointments to make sure everything is functioning properly.
[patient] okay, that sounds good. thank you for taking care of me.
[doctor] of course, it was my pleasure. we want to make sure you stay healthy and comfortable.","[doctor] hey there, how are you feeling?

"PROCEDURES PERFORMED:
1.  Left heart catheterization.
2.  Bilateral selective coronary angiography.
3.  Left ventriculogram was not performed.
INDICATION:
Non-ST elevation MI.
PROCEDURE:
After risks, benefits, and alternatives of the above-mentioned procedure were explained in detail to the patient, informed consent was obtained both verbally and in writing.  The patient was taken to cardiac catheterization suite where the right femoral region was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  1% lidocaine solution was used to infiltrate the skin overlying the right femoral artery.  Once adequate anesthesia had been obtained, a thin-walled #18 gauge Argon needle was used to cannulate the right femoral artery.  A steel guidewire was inserted through the needle into the vascular lumen without resistance.  A small nick was then made in the skin.  The pressure was held.  The needle was removed over the guidewire.  Next, a Judkins left #4 catheter was advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of a guidewire.  The guidewire was removed.  The catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  The ostium of the left main coronary artery was engaged.  Using hand injections of nonionic contrast material, the left coronary system was evaluated in several different views.  Once an adequate study had been performed, the catheter was removed from the ostium of the left main coronary artery and a steel guidewire was inserted through the catheter.  The catheter was then removed over the guidewire.
Next, a Judkins right #4 catheter was advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of a guidewire.  The guidewire was removed.  The catheter was connected to manifold and flushed.  The catheter did slip into the left ventricle.  During the rotation, the LVEDP was then measured.  The ostium of the right coronary artery was then engaged.  Using hand injections of nonionic contrast material, the right coronary system was evaluated in several different views.  Once adequate study has been performed, the catheter was then removed.  The sheath was lastly flushed for the final time.
FINDINGS:
LEFT MAIN CORONARY ARTERY:
The left main coronary artery is a moderate caliber vessel, which bifurcates into the left anterior descending and circumflex arteries.  There is no evidence of any hemodynamically significant stenosis.
LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY:
The LAD is a moderate caliber vessel, which is subtotaled in its mid portion for approximately 1.5 cm to 1 cm with subsequent TIMI-I flow distally.  The distal portion was diffusely diseased.  The proximal portion otherwise shows minor luminal irregularities.  The first diagonal branch demonstrated minor luminal irregularities throughout.
CIRCUMFLEX ARTERY:
The circumflex is a moderate caliber vessel, which traverses through the atrioventricular groove.  There is a 60% proximal lesion and a 90% mid lesion prior to the takeoff of the first obtuse marginal branch.  The first obtuse marginal branch demonstrates minor luminal irregularities throughout.
RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY:
The RCA is a moderate caliber vessel, which demonstrates a 90% mid stenotic lesion.  The dominant coronary artery gives off the posterior descending artery and posterolateral artery.  The left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was approximately 22 mmHg.  It should be noted that during injection of the contrast agent that there was ST elevation in the inferior leads, which resolved after the injection was complete.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Three-vessel coronary artery disease involving a subtotaled left anterior descending artery with TIMI-I flow distally and 90% circumflex lesion and 90% right coronary artery lesion.
2.  Mildly elevated left-sided filling pressures.
PLAN:
1.  The patient will be transferred to Providence Hospital today for likely PCI of the mid LAD lesion with a surgical evaluation for a coronary artery bypass grafting.  These findings and plan were discussed in detail with the patient and the patient's family.  The patient is agreeable.
2.  The patient will be continued on aggressive medical therapy including beta-blocker, aspirin, ACE inhibitor, and statin therapy.  The patient will not be placed on Plavix secondary to the possibility for coronary bypass grafting.  In light of the patient's history of cranial aneurysmal bleed, the patient will be held off of Lovenox and Integrilin.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i am feeling okay, a bit weak.
[doctor] i understand that you had a left heart catheterization yesterday. i have the report here with me. it says that you have three-vessel coronary artery disease involving a subtotaled left anterior descending artery with timi-i flow distally and 90% circumflex lesion and 90% right coronary artery lesion. do you understand what that means?
[patient] not exactly, could you explain it to me, please?
[doctor] sure. so, your coronary arteries are the blood vessels that supply blood and oxygen to your heart muscles. the report shows that three of your coronary arteries have blockages, and these blockages are significant enough to cause a reduction in blood flow to your heart. the left anterior descending artery, which is one of the vessels that supply blood to the front of your heart, has a severe blockage in its middle portion, and the flow of blood there is minimal. the circumflex artery, which is around the back of your heart, also has a severe blockage, and your right coronary artery has a significant blockage in the middle portion.
[patient] oh, i see. what's the plan now?
[doctor] the plan is to transfer you to providence hospital today for a pci of the mid lad lesion with a surgical evaluation for a coronary artery bypass grafting. in simpler terms, we will try to open up the blockage in your left anterior descending artery with a procedure called pci, and if this is not successful or if there are other blockages, you may need to have coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. we are also continuing aggressive medical therapy, including medication such as beta-blockers, aspirin, ace inhibitors, and statins. however, we will not be placing you on plavix due to the possibility of coronary bypass grafting. additionally, we cannot give you lovenox and integrilin due to your history of cranial aneurysmal bleed.
[patient] okay, i understand. thank you for explaining it to me.
[doctor] you're welcome. do you have any other questions or concerns?
[patient] no, i think i understand everything.","[doctor] alright, sounds good. um, please let me know if you have any questions or if anything changes, okay? 
[patient] sure, mm-hmm.",3
"PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
Right heart catheterization.
INDICATION:
Refractory CHF to maximum medical therapy.
PROCEDURE:
After risks, benefits, and alternatives of the above-mentioned procedure were explained to the patient and the patient's family in detail, informed consent was obtained both verbally and in writing.  The patient was taken to Cardiac Catheterization Suite where the right internal jugular region was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  1% lidocaine solution was used to infiltrate the skin overlying the right internal jugular vein.  Once adequate anesthesia has been obtained, a thin-walled #18 gauge Argon needle was used to cannulate the right internal jugular vein.  A steel guidewire was then inserted through the needle into the vessel without resistance.  Small nick was then made in the skin and the needle was removed.  An #8.5 French venous sheath was then advanced over the guidewire into the vascular lumen without resistance.  The guidewire and dilator were then removed.  The sheath was then flushed.  A Swan-Ganz catheter was inserted to 20 cm and the balloon was inflated.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, the catheter was advanced into the right atrium through the right ventricle and into the pulmonary artery wedge position.  Hemodynamics were measured along the way.  Pulmonary artery saturation was obtained.  The Swan was then kept in place for the patient to be transferred to the ICU for further medical titration.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient returned to the cardiac catheterization holding area in stable and satisfactory condition.
FINDINGS:
Body surface area equals 2.04, hemoglobin equals 9.3, O2 is at 2 liters nasal cannula.  Pulmonary artery saturation equals 37.8.  Pulse oximetry on 2 liters nasal cannula equals 93%.  Right atrial pressure is 8, right ventricular pressure equals 59/9, pulmonary artery pressure equals 61/31 with mean of 43, pulmonary artery wedge pressure equals 21, cardiac output equals 3.3 by the Fick method, cardiac index is 1.6 by the Fick method, systemic vascular resistance equals 1821, and transpulmonic gradient equals 22.
IMPRESSION:
Exam and Swan findings consistent with low perfusion given that the mixed venous O2 is only 38% on current medical therapy as well as elevated right-sided filling pressures and a high systemic vascular resistance.
PLAN:
Given that the patient is unable to tolerate vasodilator therapy secondary to significant orthostasis and the fact that the patient will not respond to oral titration at this point due to lack of cardiac reserve, the patient will need to be discharged home on Primacor.  The patient is unable to continue with his dobutamine therapy secondary to nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.  At this time, we will transfer the patient to the Intensive Care Unit for titration of the Primacor therapy.  We will also increase his Lasix to 80 mg IV q.d.  We will increase his amiodarone to 400 mg daily.  We will also continue with his Coumadin therapy.  As stated previously, we will discontinue vasodilator therapy starting with the Isordil.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi doctor, i am feeling weak and tired.
[doctor] i understand, according to your medical report, you have been suffering from refractory congestive heart failure despite taking maximum medical therapy. as a result, we performed a right heart catheterization procedure. the procedure went well and we found that your mixed venous o2 was only 38% on your current medical therapy. this indicates low perfusion. your right-sided filling pressures were elevated and your systemic vascular resistance was high. 
[patient] oh, i see. what is the plan moving forward?
[doctor] based on the findings of the procedure, we will have to discharge you on primacor since you are unable to tolerate vasodilator therapy and do not respond well to oral titration. we will transfer you to the intensive care unit so that we can titrate the primacor therapy. we will also increase your lasix to 80 mg iv q.d., your amiodarone to 400 mg daily and continue with your coumadin therapy. we will have to discontinue vasodilator therapy starting with the isordil. 
[patient] okay, thank you for explaining everything to me doctor.

[patient] oh, hey doc. i'm feeling kinda weak and tired.
[doctor] alright, i hear you. so, your medical report shows that you've been dealing with congestive heart failure despite taking the maximum medication. we did a heart catheterization procedure and found some concerns with your mixed venous o2 levels.
[patient] mm-hmm, i see.
[doctor] based on the procedure, we'll discharge you on primacor and transfer you to the intensive care unit to titrate the therapy. we'll also increase your lasix and amiodarone and continue with your coumadin therapy.

[doctor] sure thing! we'll be keeping tabs on your condition and adjusting your treatment plan as needed.",3
"PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
1.  Left heart catheterization.
2.  Bilateral selective coronary angiography.
ANESTHESIA:
1% lidocaine and IV sedation, including fentanyl 25 mcg.
INDICATION:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with known moderate mitral regurgitation with partial flail of the P2 and P3 gallops who underwent outpatient evaluation for increasingly severed decreased functional capacity and retrosternal chest pain that was aggravated by exertion and decreased with rest.  It was accompanied by diaphoresis and shortness of breath.  The patient was felt to be a candidate for mitral valve repair versus mitral valve replacement and underwent a stress test as part of his evaluation for chest pain.  He underwent adenosine Cardiolite, which revealed 2 mm ST segment depression in leads II, III aVF, and V3, V4, and V5.  Stress images revealed left ventricular dilatations suggestive of multivessel disease.  He is undergoing evaluation today as a part of preoperative evaluation and because of the positive stress test.
PROCEDURE:
After risks, benefits, alternatives of the above mentioned procedure were explained to the patient in detail, informed consent was obtained both verbally and writing.  The patient was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory where the procedure was performed.  The right inguinal area was sterilely cleansed with a Betadine solution and the patient was draped in the usual manner.  1% lidocaine solution was used to anesthetize the right inguinal area.  Once adequate anesthesia had been obtained, a thin-walled Argon needle was used to cannulate the right femoral artery.
The guidewire was then advanced through the lumen of the needle without resistance and a small nick was made in the skin.  The needle was removed and a pressure was held.  A #6 French arterial sheath was advanced over the guidewire without resistance.  The dilator and guidewire were removed and the sheath was flushed.  A Judkins left #4 catheter was advanced to the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of the guidewire.  The guidewire was removed and the catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  The ostium of the left main coronary artery was carefully engaged and limited evaluation was performed after noticing that the patient had a significant left main coronary artery stenosis.  The catheter was withdrawn from the ostium of the left main coronary artery and the guidewire was inserted through the tip of the catheter.  The catheter was removed over guidewire and a Judkins right #4 catheter was advanced to the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with use of a guidewire.  The guidewire was removed and the catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  The ostium of the right coronary artery was carefully engaged and using hand injections of nonionic contrast material, the right coronary artery was evaluated in both diagonal views.  This catheter was removed.  The sheath was flushed the final time.  The patient was taken to the postcatheterization holding area in stable condition.
FINDINGS:
LEFT MAIN CORONARY ARTERY:
This vessel is seen to be heavily calcified throughout its course.  Begins as a moderate caliber vessel.  There is a 60% stenosis in the distal portion with extension of the lesion to the ostium and proximal portions of the left anterior descending and left circumflex coronary artery.
LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING CORONARY ARTERY:
This vessel is heavily calcified in its proximal portion.  It is of moderate caliber and seen post anteriorly in the intraventricular groove and wraps around the apex.  There is a 90% stenosis in the proximal portion and 90% ostial stenosis in the first and second anterolateral branches.  There is sequential 80% and 90% stenosis in the mid-portion of the vessel.  Otherwise, the LAD is seen to be diffusely diseased.
LEFT CIRCUMFLEX CORONARY ARTERY:
This vessel is also calcified in its proximal portion.  There is a greater than 90% ostial stenosis, which appears to be an extension of the lesion in the left main coronary artery.  There is a greater than 70% stenosis in the proximal portion of the first large obtuse marginal branch, otherwise, the circumflex system is seen to be diffusely diseased.
RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY:
This is a large caliber vessel and is the dominant system.  There is diffuse luminal irregularities throughout the vessel and a 80% to 90% stenosis at the bifurcation above the posterior descending artery and posterolateral branch.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Three-vessel coronary artery disease as described above.
2.  Moderate mitral regurgitation per TEE.
3.  Status post venous vein stripping of the left lower extremity and varicosities in both lower extremities.
4.  Long-standing history of phlebitis.
PLAN:
Consultation will be obtained with Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery for CABG and mitral valve repair versus replacement.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?
[patient] hi doctor. i have been experiencing retrosternal chest pain on exertion accompanied by diaphoresis and shortness of breath. 
[doctor] okay, we will need to perform some tests to see what's going on. we will start with a stress test as part of your evaluation for chest pain. 
[patient] alright.
[doctor] your stress test revealed left ventricular dilatations suggestive of multivessel disease. we need to perform a left heart catheterization and bilateral selective coronary angiography to get a clearer picture of what's going on. 
[patient] what does that involve?
[doctor] we will use a thin-walled argon needle to cannulate the right femoral artery and use a catheter to check the left main coronary artery, left anterior descending coronary artery, left circumflex coronary artery, and right coronary artery. we will be able to see the extent of the damage and narrowings in your arteries. 
[patient] okay, but what are the risks?
[doctor] the risks are minimal, but there is a slight chance of bleeding, artery blockage, or damage to the artery from the catheter. we will make sure to monitor you carefully during and after the procedure. 
[patient] sounds good. 
[doctor] after the procedure, we found that you have a three-vessel coronary artery disease and a moderate mitral regurgitation per tee. we will consult cardiovascular and thoracic surgery for cabg and mitral valve repair versus replacement.

[patient] hi doc, um, i've been having some chest pain when i exert myself and i've been sweating and having trouble breathing. 
[doctor] okay, we'll have to do some tests to figure out what's going on. we'll start with a stress test as part of your evaluation for chest pain. 
[patient] mm-hmm, sounds good. 
[doctor] so your stress test showed some left ventricular dilations that suggest multivessel disease. we need to do a left heart catheterization and bilateral selective coronary angiography to get a better idea of what's happening. 
[patient] um, what does that involve? 
[doctor] we'll use a thin-walled argon needle to cannulate the right femoral artery and use a catheter to check the left main coronary artery, left anterior descending coronary artery, left circumflex coronary artery, and right coronary artery. this will help us see the extent of the damage and narrowings in your arteries. 
[patient] uh, i see. but what are the risks? 
[doctor] the risks are very minor, but there is a slight chance of bleeding, artery blockage, or damage to the artery from the catheter. we'll make sure to monitor you carefully during and after the procedure. 
[patient] got it. 
[doctor] so after the procedure, we found that you have a three-vessel coronary artery disease and a moderate mitral regurgitation per tee. we'll consult with cardiovascular and thoracic surgery to see whether you need cabg and mitral valve repair versus replacement.

"PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed in the emergency department.
INDICATION:
Melena, acute upper GI bleed, anemia, and history of cirrhosis and varices.
FINAL IMPRESSION,1.  Scope passage massive liquid in stomach with some fresh blood near the fundus, unable to identify source due to gastric contents.
2.  Endoscopy following erythromycin demonstrated grade I esophageal varices.  No stigmata of active bleeding.  Small amount of fresh blood within the hiatal hernia.  No definite source of bleeding seen.
PLAN,1.  Repeat EGD tomorrow morning following aggressive resuscitation and transfusion.
2.  Proton-pump inhibitor drip.
3.  Octreotide drip.
4.  ICU bed.
PROCEDURE DETAILS:
Prior to the procedure, physical exam was stable.  During the procedure, vital signs remained within normal limits.  Prior to sedation, informed consent was obtained.  Risks, benefits, and alternatives including, but not limited to risk of bleeding, infection, perforation, adverse reaction to medication, failure to identify pathology, pancreatitis, and death explained to the patient and his wife, who accepted all risks.  The patient was prepped in the left lateral position.  IV sedation was given to a total of fentanyl 100 mcg and midazolam 4 mg for the initial EGD.  An additional 50 mcg of fentanyl and 2 mg of midazolam were given following erythromycin.  Scope tip of the Olympus gastroscope was passed into the esophagus.  Proximal, middle, and distal thirds of the esophagus were well visualized.  There was fresh blood in the esophagus, which was washed thoroughly, but no source was seen.  No evidence of varices was seen.  The stomach was entered.  The stomach was filled with very large clot and fresh blood and liquid, which could not be suctioned due to the clot burden.  There was a small amount of bright red blood near the fundus, but a source could not be identified due to the clot burden.  Because of this, the gastroscope was withdrawn.  The patient was given 250 mg of erythromycin in the Emergency Department and 30 minutes later, the scope was repassed.  On the second look, the esophagus was cleared.  The liquid gastric contents were cleared.  There was still a moderate amount of clot burden in the stomach, but no active bleeding was seen.  There was a small grade I esophageal varices, but no stigmata of bleed.  There was also a small amount of fresh blood within the hiatal hernia, but no source of bleeding was identified.  The patient was hemodynamically stable; therefore, a decision was made for a second look in the morning.  The scope was withdrawn and air was suctioned.

"PROCEDURES PERFORMED:
Endoscopy.
INDICATIONS:
Dysphagia.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Esophageal ring and active reflux esophagitis.
PROCEDURE:
Informed consent was obtained prior to the procedure from the parents and patient.  The oral cavity is sprayed with lidocaine spray.  A bite block is placed.  Versed IV 5 mg and 100 mcg of IV fentanyl was given in cautious increments.  The GIF-160 diagnostic gastroscope used.  The patient was alert during the procedure.  The esophagus was intubated under direct visualization.  The scope was advanced toward the GE junction with active reflux esophagitis involving the distal one-third of the esophagus noted.  The stomach was unremarkable.  Retroflexed exam unremarkable.  Duodenum not intubated in order to minimize the time spent during the procedure.  The patient was alert although not combative.  A balloon was then inserted across the GE junction, 15 mm to 18 mm, and inflated to 3, 4.7, and 7 ATM, and left inflated at 18 mm for 45 seconds.  The balloon was then deflated.  The patient became uncomfortable and a good-size adequate distal esophageal tear was noted.  The scope and balloon were then withdrawn.  The patient left in good condition.
IMPRESSION:
Successful dilation of distal esophageal fracture in the setting of active reflux esophagitis albeit mild.
PLAN:
I will recommend that the patient be on lifelong proton pump inhibition and have repeat endoscopy performed as needed.  This has been discussed with the parents.  He was sent home with a prescription for omeprazole.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?

The patient is a 10-year-old right-hand dominant male, who threw himself off a quad on 10/10/2007.  The patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation of his left elbow fracture dislocation.  The patient also sustained a nondisplaced right glenoid neck fracture.  The patient's fracture has healed without incident, although he had significant postoperative stiffness for which he is undergoing physical therapy, as well as use of a Dynasplint.  The patient is neurologically intact distally.  Given the fact that his fracture has healed, surgery was recommended for hardware removal to decrease his irritation with elbow extension from the hardware.  Risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed.  The risks of surgery included the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremities, failure to remove hardware, failure to relieve pain, continued postoperative stiffness.  All questions were answered and the parents agreed to the above plan.
PROCEDURE:
The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient's left upper extremity was then prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion.  Using fluoroscopy, the patient's K-wire was located.  An incision was made over his previous scar.  A subcutaneous dissection then took place in the plane between the subcutaneous fat and muscles.  The K-wires were easily palpable.  A small incision was made into the triceps, which allowed for visualization of the two pins, which were removed without incident.  The wound was then irrigated.  The triceps split was now closed using #2-0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was also closed using #2-0 Vicryl and the skin with #4-0 Monocryl.  The wound was clean and dry and dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, and 4 x 4s, as well as bias.  A total of 10 mL of 0.25% Marcaine was injected into the incision, as well as the joint line.  At the beginning of the case, prior to removal of the hardware, the arm was taken through some strenuous manipulations with improvement of his extension to 20 degrees, flexion to 130 degrees and pronation supination to about 40 degrees.
DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:
The postoperative films demonstrated no fracture, no retained hardware.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was subsequently taken to the recovery room in stable condition.
POSTOPERATIVE PLAN:
The patient will restart physical therapy and Dynasplint in 3 days.  The patient is to follow up in 1 week's time for a wound check.  The patient was given Tylenol No.  3 for pain.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after your surgery?
[patient] i'm a bit sore, but i'm doing okay.
[doctor] that's normal after surgery. can you tell me more about the procedure?
[patient] sure. they put me under general anesthesia, and they removed the hardware from my left elbow. they also did a left elbow manipulation.

"TYPE OF PROCEDURE:
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Abdominal pain.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Normal endoscopy.
PREMEDICATION:
Fentanyl 125 mcg IV, Versed 8 mg IV.
INDICATIONS:
This healthy 28-year-old woman has had biliary colic-type symptoms for the past 3-1/2 weeks, characterized by severe pain, and brought on by eating greasy foods.  She has had similar episodes couple of years ago and was told, at one point, that she had gallstones, but after her pregnancy, a repeat ultrasound was done, and apparently was normal, and nothing was done at that time.  She was evaluated in the emergency department recently, when she developed this recurrent pain, and laboratory studies were unrevealing.  Ultrasound was normal and a HIDA scan was done, which showed a low normal ejection fraction of 40%, and moderate reproduction of her pain.  Endoscopy was requested to make sure there is not upper GI source of her pain before considering cholecystectomy.
PROCEDURE:
The patient was premedicated and the Olympus GIF 160 video endoscope advanced to the distal duodenum.  Gastric biopsies were taken to rule out Helicobacter and the procedure was completed without complication.
IMPRESSION:
Normal endoscopy.
PLAN:
Refer to a general surgeon for consideration of cholecystectomy.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?
[patient] i'm doing alright, thanks.

"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Briefly, this is a 17-year-old male, who has had problems with dysphagia to solids and recently had food impacted in the lower esophagus.  He is now having upper endoscopy to evaluate the esophagus after edema and inflammation from the food impaction has resolved, to look for any stricture that may need to be dilated, or any other mucosal abnormality.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
EGD.
PREP:
Cetacaine spray, 100 mcg of fentanyl IV, and 5 mg of Versed IV.
FINDINGS:
The tip of the endoscope was introduced into the esophagus, and the entire length of the esophagus was dotted with numerous, white, punctate lesions, suggestive of eosinophilic esophagitis.  There were come concentric rings present.  There was no erosion or flame hemorrhage, but there was some friability in the distal esophagus.  Biopsies throughout the entire length of the esophagus from 25-40 cm were obtained to look for eosinophilic esophagitis.  There was no stricture or Barrett mucosa.  The bony and the antrum of the stomach are normal without any acute peptic lesions.  Retroflexion of the tip of the endoscope in the body of the stomach revealed a normal cardia.  There were no acute lesions and no evidence of ulcer, tumor, or polyp.  The pylorus was easily entered, and the first, second, and third portions of the duodenum are normal.  Adverse reactions:  None.
FINAL IMPRESSION:
Esophageal changes suggestive of eosinophilic esophagitis.  Biopsies throughout the length of the esophagus were obtained for microscopic analysis.  There was no evidence of stricture, Barrett, or other abnormalities in the upper GI tract.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after the endoscopy procedure?
[patient] i'm doing okay, just a little bit sore.
[doctor] alright, so let's go over the results of your egd. it looks like the entire length of your esophagus had numerous white punctate lesions, which makes us suspect eosinophilic esophagitis. we did not see any stricture or barrett mucosa, which is good news. however, we did take biopsies throughout the entire length of your esophagus to confirm the diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis.
[patient] what is eosinophilic esophagitis?
[doctor] it's a condition where the lining of your esophagus becomes inflamed due to an allergic reaction. this can cause symptoms like difficulty swallowing, chest pain, and heartburn. it's not a life-threatening condition, but it can be uncomfortable.
[patient] what are the next steps?
[doctor] we'll wait for the biopsy results to come back to confirm the diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis. if that's the case, we'll work on a treatment plan which will most likely involve avoiding certain foods that trigger the allergic reaction and taking medication to reduce inflammation. in the meantime, you should avoid any foods that you know cause you trouble and continue taking any medications that were previously prescribed to you.
[patient] okay, sounds good. thank you for explaining everything to me.
[doctor] of course, if you have any other questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to me.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after the endoscopy procedure?

"REASON FOR EXAM:
Dynamic ST-T changes with angina.
PROCEDURE:
1.  Selective coronary angiography.
2.  Left heart catheterization with hemodynamics.
3.  LV gram with power injection.
4.  Right femoral artery angiogram.
5.  Closure of the right femoral artery using 6-French AngioSeal.
Procedure explained to the patient, with risks and benefits.  The patient agreed and signed the consent form.
The patient received a total of 2 mg of Versed and 25 mcg of fentanyl for conscious sedation.  The patient was draped and dressed in the usual sterile fashion.  The right groin area infiltrated with lidocaine solution.  Access to the right femoral artery was successful, okayed with one attempt with anterior wall stick.  Over a J-wire, 6-French sheath was introduced using modified Seldinger technique.
Over the J-wire, a JL4 catheter was passed over the aortic arch.  The wire was removed.  Catheter was engaged into the left main.  Multiple pictures with RAO caudal, AP cranial, LAO cranial, shallow RAO, and LAO caudal views were all obtained.  Catheter disengaged and exchanged over J-wire into a JR4 catheter, the wire was removed.  Catheter with counter-clock was rotating to the RCA one shot with LAO, position was obtained.  The cath disengaged and exchanged over J-wire into a pigtail catheter.  Pigtail catheter across the aortic valve.  Hemodynamics obtained.  LV gram with power injection of 36 mL of contrast was obtained.
The LV gram assessed followed by pullback hemodynamics.
The catheter exchanged out and the right femoral artery angiogram completed to the end followed by the removal of the sheath and deployment of 6-French AngioSeal with no hematoma.  The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate postprocedure complication.
HEMODYNAMICS:
The aortic pressure was 117/61 with a mean pressure of 83.  The left ventricular pressure was 119/9 to 19 with left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 17 to 19 mmHg.  The pullback across the aortic valve reveals zero gradient.
ANATOMY:
The left main showed minimal calcification as well as the proximal LAD.  No stenosis in the left main seen, the left main bifurcates in to the LAD and left circumflex.
The LAD was a large and a long vessel that wraps around the apex showed no focal stenosis or significant atheromatous plaque and the flow was TIMI 3 flow in the LAD.  The LAD gave off two early diagonal branches.  The second was the largest of the two and showed minimal lumen irregularities, but no focal stenosis.
Left circumflex was a dominant system supplying three obtuse marginal branches and distally supplying the PDA.  The left circumflex was large and patent, 6.0 mm in diameter.  All three obtuse marginal branches appeared to be with no significant stenosis.
The obtuse marginal branch, the third OM3 showed at the origin about 30 to 40% minimal narrowing, but no significant stenosis.  The PDA was wide, patent, with no focal stenosis.
The RCA was a small nondominant system with no focal stenosis and supplying the RV marginal.
LV gram showed that the LV EF is preserved with EF of 60%.  No mitral regurgitation identified.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Patent coronary arteries with normal left anterior descending, left circumflex, and dominant left circumflex system.
2.  Nondominant right, which is free of atheromatous plaque.
3.  Minimal plaque in the diagonal branch II, and the obtuse,marginal branch III, with no focal stenosis.
4.  Normal left ventricular function.
5.  Evaluation for noncardiac chest pain would be recommended.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm feeling better, thanks.
[doctor] that's great to hear. i just wanted to go over the results of your recent procedure. the angiography showed that your coronary arteries are patent, which means there are no blockages. your left anterior descending and left circumflex arteries are normal, and your left circumflex system is dominant.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] we did find minimal plaque in the diagonal branch ii and the obtuse marginal branch iii, but there were no focal stenoses, which means there were no significant blockages. your left ventricular function is normal, and the evaluation showed that there is no mitral regurgitation.
[patient] i see.
[doctor] since the results of the procedure indicate that there are no cardiac issues, i would recommend that we evaluate you for non-cardiac chest pain to determine the cause of your symptoms. we can discuss the next steps for that evaluation at your next appointment.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?

"PROCEDURES PERFORMED:
Colonoscopy.
INDICATIONS:
Renewed symptoms likely consistent with active flare of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, not responsive to conventional therapy including sulfasalazine, cortisone, local therapy.
PROCEDURE:
Informed consent was obtained prior to the procedure with special attention to benefits, risks, alternatives.  Risks explained as bleeding, infection, bowel perforation, aspiration pneumonia, or reaction to the medications.  Vital signs were monitored by blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.  Supplemental O2 given.  Specifics discussed.  Preprocedure physical exam performed.  Stable vital signs.  Lungs clear.  Cardiac exam showed regular rhythm.  Abdomen soft.  Her past history, her past workup, her past visitation with me for Inflammatory Bowel Disease, well responsive to sulfasalazine reviewed.  She currently has a flare and is not responding, therefore, likely may require steroid taper.  At the same token, her symptoms are mild.  She has rectal bleeding, essentially only some rusty stools.  There is not significant diarrhea, just some lower stools.  No significant pain.  Therefore, it is possible that we are just dealing with a hemorrhoidal bleed, therefore, colonoscopy now needed.  Past history reviewed.  Specifics of workup, need for followup, and similar discussed.  All questions answered.
A normal digital rectal examination was performed.  The PCF-160 AL was inserted into the anus and advanced to the cecum without difficulty, as identified by the ileocecal valve, cecal stump, and appendical orifice.  All mucosal aspects thoroughly inspected, including a retroflexed examination.  Withdrawal time was greater than six minutes.  Unfortunately, the terminal ileum could not be intubated despite multiple attempts.
Findings were those of a normal cecum, right colon, transverse colon, descending colon.  A small cecal polyp was noted, this was biopsy-removed, placed in bottle #1.  Random biopsies from the cecum obtained, bottle #2; random biopsies from the transverse colon obtained, as well as descending colon obtained, bottle #3.  There was an area of inflammation in the proximal sigmoid colon, which was biopsied, placed in bottle #4.  There was an area of relative sparing, with normal sigmoid lining, placed in bottle #5, randomly biopsied, and then inflammation again in the distal sigmoid colon and rectum biopsied, bottle #6, suggesting that we may be dealing with Crohn disease, given the relative sparing of the sigmoid colon and junk lesion.  Retroflexed showed hemorrhoidal disease.  Scope was then withdrawn, patient left in good condition.
IMPRESSION:
Active flare of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, question of Crohn disease.
PLAN:
I will have the patient follow up with me, will follow up on histology, follow up on the polyps.  She will be put on a steroid taper and make an appointment and hopefully steroids alone will do the job.  If not, she may be started on immune suppressive medication, such as azathioprine, or similar.  All of this has been reviewed with the patient.  All questions answered.","[doctor] hi! how are you feeling?
[patient] hi, not too good. i've been having symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
[doctor] i see. i reviewed your medical note and i understand that you have an active flare of ibd, which is not responding to conventional therapy.
[patient] yes, that's correct.
[doctor] i recommend that we perform a colonoscopy to investigate further. do you have any questions about the procedure?
[patient] no, i don't think so.
[doctor] okay, great. we will obtain informed consent from you, and special attention will be given to the benefits, risks, and alternatives of the procedure. the risks include bleeding, infection, bowel perforation, aspiration pneumonia, or reaction to the medications. we will monitor your vital signs and administer supplemental oxygen. we will also perform a physical exam before the procedure.
[patient] alright.
[doctor] during the colonoscopy, we will examine the mucosal aspects of your colon and take biopsies from v","[doctor] perfect. i will schedule the colonoscopy and provide you with instructions on how to prepare for the procedure. do you have any other questions or concerns?

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Diarrhea, suspected irritable bowel.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Normal colonoscopy.
PREMEDICATIONS:
Versed 5 mg, Demerol 75 mg IV.

The rectal exam revealed no external lesions.  The prostate was normal in size and consistency.
The colonoscope was inserted into the cecum with ease.  The cecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure, transverse colon, splenic flexure, descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum were normal.  The scope was retroflexed in the rectum and no abnormality was seen, so the scope was straightened, withdrawn, and the procedure terminated.
ENDOSCOPIC IMPRESSION:

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Left knee medial femoral condyle osteochondritis dissecans.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Left knee medial femoral condyle osteochondritis dissecans.
PROCEDURES:
Left knee arthroscopy with removal of the cartilage loose body and microfracture of the medial femoral condyle with chondroplasty.
ANESTHESIA:
General.
TOURNIQUET TIME:
Thirty-seven minutes.
MEDICATIONS:
The patient also received 30 mL of 0.5% Marcaine local anesthetic at the end of the case.
COMPLICATIONS:
No intraoperative complications.
DRAINS AND SPECIMENS:
None.
INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS:
The patient had a loose body that was found in the suprapatellar pouch upon entry of the camera.  This loose body was then subsequently removed.  It measured 24 x 14 mm.  This was actually the OCD lesion seen on the MRI that had come from the weightbearing surface of just the lateral posterior aspect of the medial femoral condyle,HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:
The patient is 13-year-old male with persistent left knee pain.  He was initially seen at Sierra Pacific Orthopedic Group where an MRI demonstrated unstable OCD lesion of the left knee.  The patient presented here for a second opinion.  Surgery was recommended grossly due to the instability of the fragment.  Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed.  The risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion extremity, failure to relieve pain or restore the articular cartilage, possible need for other surgical procedures, and possible early arthritis.  All questions were answered and parents agreed to the above plan.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the upper aspect of the patient's left thigh.  The extremity was then prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.  The standard portals were marked on the skin.  The extremity was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of tourniquet to 250 mmHg.  The portal incisions were then made by an #11 blade.  Camera was inserted into the lateral joint line.  There was a noted large cartilage loose body in the suprapatellar pouch.  This was subsequently removed with extension of the anterolateral portal.  Visualization of the rest of the knee revealed significant synovitis.  The patient had a large cartilage defect in the posterolateral aspect of the medial femoral condyle.  The remainder of the knee demonstrated no other significant cartilage lesions, loose bodies, plica or meniscal pathology.  ACL was also visualized to be intact in the intracondylar notch.
Attention was then turned back to the large defect.  The loose cartilage was debrided using a shaver.  Microfracture technique was then performed to 4 mm depth at 2 to 3 mm distances.  Tourniquet was released at the end of the case to ensure that there was fat and bleeding at the microfracture sites.  All instruments were then removed.  The portals were closed using #4-0 Monocryl.  A total of 30 mL of 0.5% Marcaine was injected into the knee.  Wounds were then cleaned and dried, and dressed in Steri-Strips, Xeroform, 4 x 4s, and bias.  The patient was then placed in a knee immobilizer.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The tourniquet was released at 37 minutes.  He was taken to recovery in stable condition.
POSTOPERATIVE PLAN:
The loose cartilage fragment was given to the family.  The intraoperative findings were relayed with intraoperative photos.  There was a large deficit in the weightbearing portion of medial femoral condyle.  His prognosis is guarded given the fact of the fragile lesion and location, but in advantages of his age and his rehab potential down the road, if the patient still has symptoms, he may be a candidate for osteochondral autograft, a procedure which is not performed at Children's or possible cartilaginous transplant.  All questions were answered.  The patient will follow up in 10 days, may wet the wound in 5 days.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after the surgery?
[patient] my knee feels a little sore, but i'm okay.
[doctor] that's understandable. the surgery went well, and we removed the loose body in your knee and performed microfracture of the medial femoral condyle.
[patient] i see. what does that mean?
[doctor] we repaired the cartilage in your knee to help alleviate your persistent knee pain. the loose body was causing instability, which is why we had to remove it.
[patient] got it. will i need any other surgeries in the future?
[doctor] it's possible, but right now, we're taking a wait-and-see approach. if your symptoms persist, we may consider an osteochondral autograft or a cartilaginous transplant.
[patient] okay, i understand. when can i remove the dressing on my knee?
[doctor] you can wet the wound in five days, but we'll see you for a follow-up appointment in 10 days to check on your progress.
[patient] sounds good. thank you.
[doctor] you're welcome. in the meantime, make sure to rest and take it easy on your knee.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after the surgery?

"REASON FOR EXAM:
Atrial flutter/cardioversion.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
The procedure was explained to the patient with risks and benefits.  The patient agreed and signed the consent form.  The patient received sedation prior to the cardioversion with a transesophageal echo as dictated earlier with a total of 50 mcg of fentanyl and 6 mg of Versed.  The pads were applied in the anterior-posterior approach.  The synchronized cardioversion with biphasic energy delivered at 150 J. First attempt was unsuccessful.  Second attempt at 200 J with anterior-posterior approach.  With biphasic synchronized energy delivered was also unsuccessful with degeneration of the atrial flutter into atrial fibrillation.
The patient was decided to be on wave control and amiodarone and reattempted cardioversion after anticoagulation for four to six weeks and because of the reduced LV function, the success of the rate without antiarrhythmic may be low.
IMPRESSION:
Unsuccessful direct current cardioversion with permanent atrial fibrillation.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling?
[patient] i am a bit tired.
[doctor] i understand. i just went through your medical note and it says here that you had an atrial flutter/cardioversion. how did it go?
[patient] well, it was not successful. they tried twice with biphasic energy, but it did not work, and my atrial flutter degenerated into atrial fibrillation.
[doctor] i see. i am sorry to hear that. the note also says that you will be on wave control and amiodarone. can you explain that to me?
[patient] yes, the doctor recommended that i try wave control and amiodarone since the cardioversion didn't work. they also recommended that i take anticoagulants for four to six weeks and if my lv function improves, they may try cardioversion again.
[doctor] okay, i understand. is there anything else that you are experiencing or that you would like to discuss?
[patient] no, i think that's it. i just hope that the next cardioversion will be successful.
[doctor] yes, we will definitely keep that in mind. don't worry, we will continue to monitor your condition and work together to find the best solution for you.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] um, i'm feeling a bit tired, to be honest.
[doctor] i hear you. so, i was just looking at your medical record and it looks like you had an atrial flutter/cardioversion. how did that go?
[patient] yeah, um, unfortunately it wasn't successful. they tried twice with biphasic energy, but my atrial flutter turned into atrial fibrillation.
[doctor] ah, got it. i'm sorry to hear that. so, from your record, i saw that you'll be on wave control and amiodarone. can you tell me a bit more about that?
[patient] sure thing. so the doctor recommended that i try wave control and amiodarone since the cardioversion didn't work. they also suggested i take anticoagulants for four to six weeks and if my lv function improves, they may try cardioversion again.
[doctor] okay, i see. is there anything else that you're experiencing or want to talk about?
[patient] no, i think that's it for now. i just hope the next cardioversion works.
[doctor] absolutely. we'll keep an eye on things and work together to find the best solution for you.",3
"HISTORY:
The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of aortic valve replacement in the past with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who was admitted yesterday with the recurrence of such in a setting of hypokalemia, incomplete compliance with obstructive sleep apnea therapy with CPAP, chocolate/caffeine ingestion and significant mental stress.  Despite repletion of her electrolytes and maintenance with Diltiazem IV she has maintained atrial fibrillation.  I have discussed in detail with the patient regarding risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure.  After an in depth discussion of the procedure (please see my initial consultation for further details) I asked the patient this morning if she would like me to repeat that as that discussion had happened yesterday.  The patient declined.  I invited questions for her which she stated she had none and wanted to go forward with the cardioversion which seemed appropriate.
PROCEDURE NOTE:
The appropriate time-out procedure was performed as per Medical Center protocol including proper identification of the patient, physician, procedure, documentation, and there were no safety issues identified by myself nor the staff.  The patient participated actively in this.  She received a total of 4 mg of Versed then and 50 micrograms of fentanyl with utilizing titrated conscious sedation with good effect.  She was placed in the supine position and hands free patches had previously been placed in the AP position and she received one synchronized cardioversion attempt after Diltiazem drip had been turned off with successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm.  This was confirmed on 12 lead EKG.
IMPRESSION/PLAN:
Successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm from recurrent atrial fibrillation.  The patient's electrolytes are now normal and that will need close watching to avoid hypokalemia in the future, as well as she has been previously counseled for strict adherence to sleep apnea therapy with CPAP and perhaps repeat sleep evaluation would be appropriate to titrate her settings, as well as avoidance of caffeine ingestion including chocolate and minimization of mental stress.  She will be discharged on her usual robust AV nodal antiarrhythmic therapy with sotalol 80 mg p.o. b.i.d.
metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
Diltiazem CD 240 mg p.o. daily and digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. daily and to be clear she does have a permanent pacemaker implanted.  She will follow-up with her regular cardiologist, Dr. X, for whom I am covering this weekend.
This was all discussed in detail with the patient, as well as her granddaughter with the patient's verbal consent at the bedside.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm feeling fine, thank you.
[doctor] i'm glad to hear that. so, we did the cardioversion yesterday to help with the recurrent atrial fibrillation, and i'm happy to let you know that it was successful. we used some medication to help you relax during the procedure, and we were able to restore your normal sinus rhythm with one synchronized cardioversion attempt.
[patient] oh, that's good news. thank you.
[doctor] you're welcome! we will need to watch your electrolyte levels closely to avoid hypokalemia in the future. we also talked about the importance of adhering to your sleep apnea therapy with cpap, and it might be a good idea to have a repeat sleep evaluation to adjust the settings if needed. additionally, it's important to avoid caffeine, including chocolate, and minimize mental stress.
[patient] i understand. i'll make sure to follow those recommendations.
[doctor] great! you will be discharged on your usual antiarrhythmic therapy with sotalol, metoprolol, diltiazem cd, and digoxin. just a reminder, you have a permanent pacemaker implanted, and you will need to follow up with your regular cardiologist, dr. x. do you have any questions or concerns?

"EXAMINATION:
Cardiac catheterization.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
Left heart catheterization, LV cineangiography, selective coronary angiography, and right heart catheterization with cardiac output by thermodilution technique with dual transducer.
INDICATION:
Syncope with severe aortic stenosis.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
After informed consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization laboratory in a post observed state.  The right groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  After adequate conscious sedation and local anesthesia was obtained, a 6-French sheath was placed in the right common femoral artery and a 8-French sheath was placed in the right common femoral vein.  Following this, a 7.5-French Swan-Ganz catheter was advanced into the right atrium where the right atrial pressure was 10/7 mmHg.  The catheter was then manipulated into the right ventricle where the right ventricular pressure was 37/10/4 mmHg.  The catheter was then manipulated into the wedge position where the wedge pressure was noted to be 22 mmHg.  The pulmonary arterial pressures were noted to be 31/14/21 mmHg.  Following this, the catheter was removed, the sheath was flushed and a 6-French JL4 diagnostic catheter was the advanced over the guidewire and the left main coronary artery was cannulated and selective angiogram was obtained in orthogonal views.  Following this, the catheter was exchanged over the guidewire for 6-French JR4 diagnostic catheter.  We were unable to cannulate the right coronary artery.  Therefore, we exchanged for a Williams posterior catheter and we were able to cannulate the right coronary artery and angiographs were performed in orthogonal views.  Following this, this catheter was exchanged over a guidewire for a 6-French Langston pigtail catheter and the left ventricle was entered and left ventriculography was performed.  Following this, the catheters were removed.  Sheath angiograms revealed the sheath to be in the right common femoral artery and the right common femoral arteriotomy was sealed using a 6-French Angio-Seal device.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.
DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS:
The left main coronary artery is a large vessel, which bifurcates into the left anterior descending artery and left circumflex artery and has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities with no critical lesions.  The left circumflex artery is a short vessel, which gives off one major obtuse marginal artery and has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities with no critical lesions.  The left anterior descending artery has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities and gives off two major diagonal branches.  There is a 70% ostial lesion in the first diagonal branch and the second diagonal branch has mild-to-moderate luminal irregularities.  The right coronary artery is a very large dominant vessel with a 60% to 70% lesion in its descending mid-portion.  The remainder of the vessel has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities with no critical lesions.  The left ventricle appears to be normal sized.  The aortic valve is heavily calcified.  The estimated ejection fraction is approximately 60%.  There was 4+ mitral regurgitation noted.  The mean gradient across the aortic valve was noted to be 33 mmHg yielding an aortic valve area of 0.89 cm2.
CONCLUSION:
1.  Moderate-to-severe coronary artery disease with a high-grade lesion seen at the ostium of the first diagonal artery as well as a 60% to 70% lesion seen at the mid portion of the right coronary artery.
2.  Moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.89 cm2.
3.  4+ mitral regurgitation.
PLAN:
The patient will most likely need a transesophageal echocardiogram to better evaluate the valvular architecture and the patient will be referred to Dr Kenneth Fang for possible aortic valve replacement as well as mitral valve repair/replacement and possible surgical revascularization.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling?
[patient] hi, i'm okay. a little tired.
[doctor] i can imagine. you just had a cardiac catheterization procedure done. how did that go?
[patient] it went well. i was a little nervous, but the doctors and nurses took good care of me.
[doctor] that's great to hear. i'm looking at the results of your procedure and it looks like there are a few things we need to discuss.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] first of all, you have moderate-to-severe coronary artery disease. there's a high-grade lesion seen at the ostium of the first diagonal artery as well as a 60% to 70% lesion seen at the mid portion of the right coronary artery. this means that you have some blockages in your heart's blood vessels.
[patient] oh no.
[doctor] yes, it's definitely something we need to keep an eye on. we'll likely need to do further testing and discuss possible treatment options.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] in addition to the coronary artery disease, you also have moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis. this means that your aortic valve is narrowed, making it harder for blood to flow through your heart.
[patient] oh.
[doctor] yes, this is a serious condition that will likely require surgery. we'll need to do a transesophageal echocardiogram to better evaluate the valve, and then we'll refer you to a specialist for possible valve replacement.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] finally, you have 4+ mitral regurgitation, which means that blood is leaking backwards into your heart. this will also require surgery, and we'll discuss options with the specialist.
[patient] okay, i understand.
[doctor] i know this is a lot to take in, but we'll be with you every step of the way. do you have any questions?
[patient] not right now, but i'm sure i will as we move forward with treatment.

"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS:
Strokes.
SPEECH AND LANGUAGE THERAPY DIAGNOSIS:
Global aphasia.
SUBJECTIVE:
The patient is a 44-year-old female who is referred to Medical Center's Outpatient Rehabilitation Department for skilled speech therapy, status post stroke.  The patient's sister-in-law was present throughout this assessment and provided all the patient's previous medical history.  Based on the sister-in-law's report, the patient had a stroke on 09/19/08.  The patient spent 6 weeks at XY Medical Center, where she was subsequently transferred to XYZ for therapy for approximately 3 weeks.  ABCD brought the patient to home the Monday before Thanksgiving, because they were not satisfied with the care the patient was receiving at a skilled nursing facility in Tucson.  The patient's previous medical history includes a long history of illegal drug use to include cocaine, crystal methamphetamine, and marijuana.  In March of 2008, the patient had some type of potassium issue and she was hospitalized at that time.  Prior to the stroke, the patient was not working and ABCD reported that she believes the patient completed the ninth grade, but she did not graduate from high school.  During the case history, I did pose several questions to the patient, but her response was often ""no.""  She was very emotional during this evaluation and crying occurred multiple times.
OBJECTIVE:
To evaluate the patient's overall communication ability, a Western Aphasia Battery was completed.  Also tests were not done due to time constraint and the patient's severe difficulty and emotional state.  Speech automatic tests were also completed to determine if the patient had any functional speech.
ASSESSMENT:
Based on the results of the Weston aphasia battery, the patient's deficits most closely resemble global aphasia.  On the spontaneous speech subtest, the patient responded ""no"" to all questions asked except for how are you today where she gave a thumbs-up.  She provided no responses to picture description task and it is unclear if the patient was unable to follow the direction or if she was unable to see the picture clearly.  The patient's sister-in-law did state that the patient wore glasses, but she currently does not have them and she did not know the extent the patient's visual deficit.
On the auditory verbal comprehension portion of the Western Aphasia Battery, the patient answered ""no"" to all ""yes/no"" questions.  The auditory word recognition subtest, the patient had 5 out of 60 responses correct.  With the sequential command, she had 10 out of 80 corrects.  She was able to shut her eyes, point to the window, and point to the pen after directions.  With repetition subtest, she repeated bed correctly, but no other stimuli.  At this time, the patient became very emotional and repeatedly stated ""I can't"".  During the naming subtest of the Western Aphasia Battery, the patient's responses contained numerous paraphasias and her speech was often unintelligible due to jargon.  The word fluency test was not administered and the patient scored 2 out of 10 on the sentence completion task and 0 out of 10 on the responsive speech.  In regards to speech automatics, the patient is able to count from 1 to 9 accurately; however, stated 7 instead of 10 at the end of the task.  She is not able to state the days of the week or months in the year or her name at this time.  She cannot identify the day on calendar and was unable to verbally state the date or month.
DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:
The patient's communication deficits most closely resemble global aphasia where she has difficulty with both receptive as well as expressive communication.  She does perseverate and is very emotional due to probable frustration.  Outpatient skilled speech therapy is recommended to improve the patient's functional communication skills.
PATIENT GOAL:
Her sister-in-law stated that they would like to improve upon the patient's speech to allow her to communicate more easily at home.
PLAN OF CARE:
Outpatient skilled speech therapy two times a week for the next 12 weeks.  Therapy to include aphasia treatment and home activities.
SHORT-TERM GOALS (8 WEEKS):
1.  The patient will answer simple ""yes/no"" questions with greater than 90% accuracy with minimal cueing.
2.  The patient will be able to complete speech automatic tasks with greater than 80% accuracy without models or cueing.
3.  The patient will be able to complete simple sentence completion and/or phrase completion with greater than 80% accuracy with minimal cueing.
4.  The patient will be able to follow simple one-step commands with greater than 80% accuracy with minimal cueing.
5.  The patient will be able to name 10 basic everyday objects with greater than 80% accuracy with minimal cueing.
SHORT-TERM GOALS (12 WEEKS):
Functional communication abilities to allow the patient to express her basic wants and needs.","[doctor] hi, how are you doing today?

"DIAGNOSIS:
Status post brain tumor with removal.
SUBJECTIVE:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with previous medical history of breast cancer that has metastasized to her lung, liver, spleen, and brain, status post radiation therapy.  The patient stated that on 10/24/08 she had a brain tumor removed with subsequent left-sided weakness.  The patient was readmitted to ABC Hospital on 12/05/08 and was found to have massive swelling in the brain and a second surgery was performed to reduce the swelling.  The patient remained at the acute rehab at ABC until she was discharged home on 01/05/09.  The patient did receive skilled speech therapy while in the acute rehab, which focused on higher level cognitive and linguistic skills such as attention, memory, mental flexibility, and improvement of her executive function.  The patient also complains of difficulty with word retrieval and slurring of speech.  The patient denies any difficulty with swallowing at this time.
OBJECTIVE:
Portions of the cognitive linguistic quick test was administered.  An oral mechanism exam was performed.  A motor speech protocol was completed.
The cognitive linguistic subtests of recalling personal facts, symbol cancellation, confrontational naming, clock drawing, story retelling, generative naming, design and memory, and completion of mazes was administered.
The patient was 100% accurate with recalling personal facts, completion of the symbol cancellation tasks, and with confrontational naming.  She had no difficulty with the clock drawing task; however, she has considerable hand tremors, which makes writing difficult.  In the storytelling task, she scored within normal limits.  She was also within normal limits for generative naming.  She did have difficulty with the design, memory, and mazes subtests.  She was unable to complete the second maze during the allotted time.  The design generation subtest was also completed.  She was able to draw four unique designs, and toward the end of the tasks was no longer able to recall the stated direction.
ORAL MECHANISM EXAMINATION:
The patient has mild left facial droop with decreased nasolabial fold.  Tongue is at midline, and lingual range of motion and strength are within functional limit.  The patient does complain of biting her tongue on occasion, but denied biting the inside of her cheeks.  Her AMRs are judged to be within functional limit.  Her rate of speech is decreased with a monotonous vocal quality.  The decreased rate may be a compensation for decreased word retrieval ability.  The patient's speech is judged to be 100% intelligible without background noise.
DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:
The patient has mild cognitive linguistic deficits in the areas of higher level cognitive function seen in mental flexibility, memory, and executive function.
PLAN OF CARE:
Outpatient skilled speech therapy two times a week for four weeks to include cognitive linguistic treatment.
SHORT-TERM GOALS (THREE WEEKS):
1.  The patient will complete deductive reasoning and mental flexibility tasks with greater than 90% accuracy, independently.
2.  The patient will complete perspective memory test with 100% accuracy using compensatory strategy.
3.  The patient will complete visual perceptual activities, which focus on scanning, flexibility, and problem solving with greater than 90% accuracy with minimal cueing.
4.  The patient will listen to and/or read a lengthy narrative and be able to recall at least 6 details after a 15-minute delay, independently.
PATIENT'S GOAL:
To improve functional independence and cognitive abilities.
LONG-TERM GOAL (FOUR WEEKS):
Functional cognitive linguistic abilities to improve safety and independence at home and to decrease burden of care on caregiver.

"SUBJECTIVE:
The patient is a 60-year-old female, who complained of coughing during meals.  Her outpatient evaluation revealed a mild-to-moderate cognitive linguistic deficit, which was completed approximately 2 months ago.  The patient had a history of hypertension and TIA/stroke.  The patient denied history of heartburn and/or gastroesophageal reflux disorder.  A modified barium swallow study was ordered to objectively evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety and to rule out aspiration.
OBJECTIVE:
Modified barium swallow study was performed in the Radiology Suite in cooperation with Dr. ABC.  The patient was seated upright in a video imaging chair throughout this assessment.  To evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety, she was administered graduated amounts of liquid and food mixed with barium in the form of thin liquid (teaspoon x2, cup sip x2); nectar-thick liquid (teaspoon x2, cup sip x2); puree consistency (teaspoon x2); and solid food consistency (1/4 cracker x1).
ASSESSMENT,ORAL STAGE:
Premature spillage to the level of the valleculae and pyriform sinuses with thin liquid.  Decreased tongue base retraction, which contributed to vallecular pooling after the swallow.
PHARYNGEAL STAGE:
No aspiration was observed during this evaluation.  Penetration was noted with cup sips of thin liquid only.  Trace residual on the valleculae and on tongue base with nectar-thick puree and solid consistencies.  The patient's hyolaryngeal elevation and anterior movement are within functional limits.  Epiglottic inversion is within functional limits.
CERVICAL ESOPHAGEAL STAGE:
The patient's upper esophageal sphincter opening is well coordinated with swallow and readily accepted the bolus.  Radiologist noted reduced peristaltic action of the constricted muscles in the esophagus, which may be contributing to the patient's complaint of globus sensation.
DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:
No aspiration was noted during this evaluation.  Penetration with cup sips of thin liquid.  The patient did cough during this evaluation, but that was noted related to aspiration or penetration.
PROGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:
Based on this evaluation, the prognosis for swallowing and safety is good.
PLAN:
Based on this evaluation and following recommendations are being made:
1.  The patient to take small bite and small sips to help decrease the risk of aspiration and penetration.
2.  The patient should remain upright at a 90-degree angle for at least 45 minutes after meals to decrease the risk of aspiration and penetration as well as to reduce her globus sensation.
3.  The patient should be referred to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation of her esophageal function.
The patient does not need any skilled speech therapy for her swallowing abilities at this time, and she is discharged from my services.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, i'm doing okay, thank you for asking.
[doctor] i have the results of your modified barium swallow study, it looks like you are experiencing premature spillage to the level of the valleculae and pyriform sinuses with thin liquid. there is decreased tongue base retraction contributing to vallecular pooling after the swallow. however, there was no aspiration noted during the evaluation, which is great news. 
[patient] okay, that's good to hear.
[doctor] there was some penetration noted with cup sips of thin liquid, but trace residual was present on the valleculae and on the tongue base with nectar-thick puree and solid consistencies. 
[patient] i see.
[doctor] based on this evaluation, the prognosis for swallowing and safety is good. however, i do have some recommendations for you to decrease the risk of aspiration and penetration. firstly, take small bites and small sips during meals. secondly, remain upright at a 90-degree angle for at least 45 minutes after meals to decrease the risk of aspiration and penetration as well as to reduce your globus sensation. lastly, i suggest that you follow up with a gastroenterologist for further evaluation of your esophageal function.
[patient] alright, thank you for your advice.
[doctor] you're welcome. at this time, you do not need any skilled speech therapy for your swallowing abilities, and you are discharged from my services.","[doctor] hiya, how's it going? feeling alright today?
[patient] um, yeah, i'm doing okay. thanks for asking.
[doctor] so i got the results of that modified barium swallow study we did. it looks like you're having some premature spillage to the valleculae and pyriform sinuses with thin liquids. you're having some trouble retracting your tongue base, which is adding to the vallecular pooling. but, the good news is that there was no aspiration during the evaluation. 
[patient] mm-hmm, okay.
[doctor] we did see some penetration with cup sips of thin liquid, and there was some residual on the valleculae and tongue base with thicker liquids and solids. 
[patient] got it.
[doctor] now, the prognosis for your swallowing and safety is looking good. but, i do have some recommendations to minimize the risk of aspiration and penetration. firstly, try taking smaller bites and sips during meals. secondly, stay upright at a 90-degree angle for at least 45 minutes after eating to reduce the risk of aspiration and penetration, and to help with your globus sensation. lastly, i suggest following up with a gastroenterologist to assess your esophageal function.
[patient] alright, thank you for the advice.
[doctor] no problemo. and, you're all set for now. you won't need any skilled speech therapy for your swallowing abilities, and you're discharged from my services.",3
"SUBJECTIVE:
The patient is a 55-year-old African-American male that was last seen in clinic on 07/29/2008 with diagnosis of new onset seizures and an MRI scan, which demonstrated right contrast-enhancing temporal mass.  Given the characteristics of this mass and his new onset seizures, it is significantly concerning for a high-grade glioma.
OBJECTIVE:
The patient is alert and oriented times three, GCS of 15.  Cranial nerves II to XII are grossly intact.  Motor exam demonstrates 5/5 strength in all four extremities.  Sensation is intact to light touch, pain, temperature, and proprioception.  Cerebellar exam is intact.  Gait is normal and tandem on heels and toes.  Speech is appropriate.  Judgment is intact.  Pupils are equal and reactive to light.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
The patient is a 55-year-old African-American male with a new diagnosis of rim-enhancing right temporal mass.  Given the characteristics of the MRI scan, it is highly likely that he demonstrates high-grade glioma and concerning for glioblastoma multiforme.  We have discussed in length the possible benefits of biopsy, surgical resection, medical management, as well as chemotherapy, radiation treatments, and doing nothing.  Given the high probability that the mass represents a high-grade glioma, the patient, after weighing the risks and the benefits of surgery, has agreed to undergo a surgical biopsy and resection of the mass as well as concomitant chemotherapy and radiation as the diagnosis demonstrates a high-grade glioma.  The patient has signed consent for his right temporal craniotomy for biopsy and likely resection of right temporal brain tumor.  He agrees that he will be n.p.o. after mid night on Wednesday night.  He is sent for preoperative assessment with the Anesthesiology tomorrow morning.  He has undergone vocational rehab assessment.","[doctor] hello, how are you doing today?
[patient] i'm a little nervous, to be honest.
[doctor] that's understandable. i know we've been monitoring the mass in your right temporal lobe, and based on the mri scan, it's highly concerning for a high-grade glioma. we've discussed the possible options for treatment, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. have you had any thoughts about which option you would prefer?
[patient] yes, after weighing the risks and benefits, i would like to proceed with a surgical biopsy and resection of the mass, along with chemotherapy and radiation. i understand that there are risks involved, but i believe it's the best option for me.
[doctor] i agree, given the characteristics of the mass. we will proceed with a right temporal craniotomy for biopsy and likely resection of the tumor. you will need to be n.p.o. after midnight on wednesday night, and we will have you undergo a preoperative assessment with the anesthesiology tomorrow morning. how have you been feeling otherwise? any changes in your symptoms?
[patient] i've had some headaches and occasional seizures, but nothing too severe.
[doctor] okay, we will continue to monitor your symptoms and adjust your treatment plan as needed. i'm glad that you've undergone vocational rehab assessment as well, so we can ensure that you have the support you need during your recovery. do you have any other questions or concerns?
[patient] no, i think i understand everything. thank you for explaining everything clearly to me.
[doctor] of course, it's important to us that you feel informed and comfortable with your treatment plan. we'll be with you every step of the way.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] um, i'm a bit nervous, to be honest.
[doctor] mm-hmm, i understand. we've been keeping an eye on the mass in your right temporal lobe and, based on the mri scan, it's looking like a high-grade glioma. we've gone through a few options for treatment, such as surgery, chemo, and radiation. have you given any thought to which one you'd prefer?
[patient] yeah, i have. after weighing the risks and benefits, i think i'd like to go ahead with a surgical biopsy and resection of the mass, along with chemo and radiation. i know there are risks involved, but it's the best option for me, i think.
[doctor] i agree. given the characteristics of the mass, that seems like the best course of action. we'll be doing a right temporal craniotomy for the biopsy and probably resection of the tumor. you'll need to be n.p.o. after midnight on wednesday night, and we'll have you do a preoperative assessment with the anesthesia team tomorrow morning. how have you been feeling otherwise? any changes in your symptoms?
[patient] i've been having some headaches and occasional seizures, but nothing too severe.

"REASON FOR VISIT:
Followup visit status post removal of external fixator and status post open reduction internal fixation of right tibial plateau fracture.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is now approximately week status post removal of Ex-Fix from the right knee with an MUA following open reduction internal fixation of right tibial plateau fracture.  The patient states that this pain is well controlled.  He has had no fevers, chills or night sweats.  He has had some mild drainage from his pin sites.  He just started doing range of motion type exercises for his right knee.  He has had no numbness or tingling.
FINDINGS:
On exam, his pin sites had no erythema.  There is some mild drainage but they have been dressing with bacitracin, it looks like there may be part of the fluid noted.  The patient had 3/5 strength in the EHL, FHL.  He has intact sensation to light touch in a DP, SP, and tibial nerve distribution.
X-rays taken include three views of the right knee.  It demonstrate status post open reduction internal fixation of the right tibial plateau with excellent hardware placement and alignment.
ASSESSMENT:
Status post open reduction and internal fixation of right tibial plateau fracture with removal ex fix.
PLANS:
I gave the patient a prescription for aggressive range of motion of the right knee.  I would like to really work on this as he has not had much up to this time.  He should remain nonweightbearing.  I would like to have him return in 2 weeks' time to assess his knee range of motion.  He should not need x-rays at that time.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, doctor. i'm feeling good, thanks.
[doctor] that's great to hear. it's been about a week since the removal of your ex-fix and open reduction internal fixation of your right tibial plateau fracture. how has your pain been since then?

"SUBJECTIVE:
This patient presents to the office today for a checkup.  He has several things to go over and discuss.  First he is sick.  He has been sick for a month intermittently, but over the last couple of weeks it is worse.  He is having a lot of yellow phlegm when he coughs.  It feels likes it is in his chest.  He has been taking Allegra-D intermittently, but he is almost out and he needs a refill.  The second problem, his foot continues to breakout.  It seems like it was getting a lot better and now it is bad again.  He was diagnosed with tinea pedis previously, but he is about out of the Nizoral cream.  I see that he is starting to breakout again now that the weather is warmer and I think that is probably not a coincidence.  He works in the flint and it is really hot where he works and it has been quite humid lately.  The third problem is that he has a wart or a spot that he thinks is a wart on the right middle finger.  He is interested in getting that frozen today.  Apparently, he tells me I froze a previous wart on him in the past and it went away.  Next, he is interested in getting some blood test done.  He specifically mentions the blood test for his prostate, which I informed him is called the PSA.  He is 50 years old now.  He will also be getting his cholesterol checked again because he has a history of high cholesterol.  He made a big difference in his cholesterol by quitting smoking, but unfortunately after taking his social history today he tells me that he is back to smoking.  He says it is difficult to quit.  He tells me he did quit chewing tobacco.  I told him to keep trying to quit smoking.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
General:  With this illness he has had no problems with fever.  HEENT:  Some runny nose, more runny nose than congestion.  Respiratory:  Denies shortness of breath.  Skin:  He has a peeling skin on the bottom of his feet, mostly the right foot that he is talking about today.  At times it is itchy.
OBJECTIVE:
His weight is 238.4 pounds, blood pressure 128/74, temperature 97.8, pulse 80, and respirations 16.  General exam:  The patient is nontoxic and in no acute distress.  Ears:  Tympanic membranes pearly gray bilaterally.  Mouth:  No erythema, ulcers, vesicles, or exudate noted.  Neck is supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation.  No rales, rhonchi, or wheezing.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur.  Extremities:  No edema, cyanosis, or clubbing.  Skin exam:  I checked out the bottom of his right foot.  He has peeling skin visible consistent with tinea pedis.  On the anterior aspect of the right third finger there is a small little raised up area that I believe represents a wart.  The size of this wart is approximately 3 mm in diameter.
ASSESSMENT:
1.  Upper respiratory tract infection, persistent.
2.  Tinea pedis.
3.  Wart on the finger.
4.  Hyperlipidemia.
5.  Tobacco abuse.
PLAN:
The patient is getting a refill on Allegra-D.  I am giving him a refill on the Nizoral 2% cream that he should use to the foot area twice a day.  I gave him instructions on how to keep the foot clean and dry because I think the reason we are dealing with this persistent problem is the fact that his feet are hot and sweaty a lot because of his work.  His wart has been present for some time now and he would like to get it frozen.  I offered him the liquid nitrogen treatment and he did agree to it.  I used liquid nitrogen after a verbal consent was obtained from the patient to freeze the wart.  He tolerated the procedure very well.  I froze it once and I allowed for a 3 mm freeze zone.  I gave him verbal wound care instructions after the procedure.  Lastly, when he is fasting I am going to send him to the lab with a slip, which I gave him today for a basic metabolic profile, CBC, fasting lipid profile, and a screening PSA test.  Lastly, for the upper respiratory tract infection, I am giving him amoxicillin 500 mg three times a day for 10 days.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, i'm not feeling too good.
[doctor] so, you mentioned you've been sick for a while, can you tell me more about that?
[patient] yes, i've been intermittently sick for the last month or so, but over the last couple of weeks, it's gotten worse. i have a lot of yellow phlegm when i cough, and it feels like it's in my chest.
[doctor] alright, i see. have you been taking any medication for this?
[patient] yes, i've been taking allegra-d intermittently, but i'm almost out, so i need a refill.
[doctor] okay, we'll make sure to get that for you. you also mentioned your foot condition, can you tell me more about that?
[patient] yes, i was diagnosed with tinea pedis previously, but it seems to be getting worse again. i think it's because of the weather, it's been quite humid and hot where i work.
[doctor] i see. i'll refill your nizoral cream, and i'll also give you some instructions on how to take care of it.
[patient] thank you.
[doctor] next, you mentioned a wart on your finger, is that correct?
[patient] yes, i think it's a wart. i've had one before, and you froze it for me.
[doctor] alright, we can do that again today, if you'd like.
[patient] yes, please.
[doctor] lastly, you mentioned getting some blood tests done, specifically for your prostate and cholesterol. we can do that for you, and while we're at it, we'll also check your basic metabolic profile and cbc.
[patient] okay, that sounds good.
[doctor] before we end, i also want to talk to you about quitting smoking. i know it's difficult, but it's important for your health. you've made progress before, and i believe you can do it again.
[patient] okay, i'll try.
[doctor] great. so, i'll prescribe you some amoxicillin for your upper respiratory tract infection, and we'll take care of the rest of your concerns today.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] um, hi, i'm not feeling too good.

"REASON FOR VISIT:
Followup 4 months status post percutaneous screw fixation of a right Schatzker IV tibial plateau fracture and second through fifth metatarsal head fractures treated nonoperatively.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 59-year-old gentleman who is now approximately 4 months status post percutaneous screw fixation of Schatzker IV tibial plateau fracture and nonoperative management of second through fifth metatarsal head fractures.  He is currently at home and has left nursing home facility.  He states that his pain is well controlled.  He has been working with physical therapy two to three times a week.  He has had no drainage or fever.  He has noticed some increasing paresthesias in his bilateral feet but has a history of spinal stenosis with lower extremity neuropathy.
FINDINGS:
On physical exam, his incision is near well healed.  He has no effusion noted.  His range of motion is 10 to 105 degrees.  He has no pain or crepitance.  On examination of his right foot, he is nontender to palpation of the metatarsal heads.  He has 4 out of 5 strength in EHL, FHL, tibialis, and gastroc-soleus complex.  He does have decreased sensation to light touch in the L4-L5 distribution of his feet bilaterally.
X-rays taken including AP and lateral of the right knee demonstrate a healed medial tibial plateau fracture status post percutaneous screw fixation.  Examination of three views of the right foot demonstrates the second through fifth metatarsal head fractures.  These appear to be extraarticular.  They are all in a bayonet arrangement, but there appears to be bridging callus between the fragments on the oblique film.
ASSESSMENT:
Four months status post percutaneous screw fixation of the right medial tibial plateau and second through fifth metatarsal head fractures.
PLANS:
I would like the patient to continue working with physical therapy.  He may be weightbearing as tolerated on his right side.  I would like him to try to continue to work to gain full extension of the right knee and increase his knee flexion.  I also would like him to work on ambulation and strengthening.
I discussed with the patient his concerning symptoms of paresthesias.  He said he has had the left thigh for a number of years and has been followed by a neurologist for this.  He states that he has had some right-sided paresthesias now for a number of weeks.  He claims he has no other symptoms of any worsening stenosis.  I told him that I would see his neurologist for evaluation or possibly a spinal surgeon if his symptoms progress.
The patient should follow up in 2 months at which time he should have AP and lateral of the right knee and three views of the right foot.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm feeling pretty good.

[doctor] great. now, on physical exam, your incision looks near well healed and you have no effusion noted. your range of motion is 10 to 105 degrees and you have no pain or crepitance. i also see that your x-rays show a healed medial tibial plateau fracture and second through fifth metatarsal head fractures. they appear to be extraarticular and there is bridging callus between the fragments on the oblique film. so, i think things are looking good. i would like you to continue working with physical therapy, and you may be weightbearing as tolerated on your right side. let's work on gaining full extension of the right knee and increasing your knee flexion. also, let's focus on ambulation and strengthening. i would like you to follow up in 2 months at which time we'll take new x-rays of your right knee and right foot.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] um, i'm feeling pretty good.
[doctor] mm-hmm, that's great to hear. so, i see that you're about 4 months post-surgery for your right tibial plateau fracture and nonoperative management of second through fifth metatarsal head fractures. how has your pain been?
[patient] uh, my pain is well controlled.
[doctor] mm-hmm, i'm glad to hear that. and i see that you've been working with physical therapy. how has that been going?
[patient] well, it's been going, uh, well, i've been going two to three times a week.

"SUBJECTIVE:
Review of the medical record shows that the patient is a 97-year-old female patient who has been admitted and has been treated for community acquired pneumonia along with COPD exacerbation.  The patient does have a longstanding history of COPD.  However, she does not use oxygen at her independent assisted living home.  Yesterday, she had made improvement since being here at the hospital.  She needed oxygen.  She was tested for home O2 and qualified for it yesterday also.  Her lungs were very tight.  She did have wheezes bilaterally and rhonchi on the right side mostly.  She appeared to be a bit weak and although she was requesting to be discharged home, she did not appear to be fit for it.
Overnight, the patient needed to use the rest room.  She stated that she needed to urinate.  She awoke, decided not to call for assistance.  She stated that she did have her nurse call light button next to her and she was unable to gain access to her walker.  She attempted to walk to the rest room on her own.  She sustained a fall.  She stated that she just felt weak.  She bumped her knee and her elbow.  She had femur x-rays, knee x-rays also.  There was possibility of subchondral fracture and some swelling of her suprapatellar bursa on the right side.  This morning, she denied any headache, back pain or neck pain.  She complained mostly of right anterior knee pain for which she had some bruising and swelling.
OBJECTIVE:
VITAL SIGNS:  The patient's max temperature over the past 24 hours was 36.5; her blood pressure is 148/77, her pulse is 87 to 106.  She is 95% on 2 L via nasal cannula.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur, gallop or rub.
LUNGS:  Reveal no expiratory wheezing throughout.  She does have some rhonchi on the right mid base.  She did have a productive cough this morning and she is coughing green purulent sputum finally.
ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.  Her bowel sounds x4 are normoactive.
NEUROLOGIC:  She is alert and oriented x3.  Her pupils are equal and reactive.  She has got a good head and facial muscle strength.  Her tongue is midline.  She has got clear speech.  Her extraocular motions are intact.  Her spine is nontender on palpation from neck to lumbar spine.  She has good range of motion with regard to her shoulders, elbows, wrists and fingers.  Her grip strengths are equal bilaterally.  Both elbows are strong from extension to flexion.  Her hip flexors and extenders are also strong and equal bilaterally.  Extension and flexion of the knee bilaterally and ankles also are strong.  Palpation of her right knee reveals no crepitus.  She does have suprapatellar inflammation with some ecchymosis and swelling.  She has got good joint range of motion however.
SKIN:  She did have a skin tear involving her right forearm lateral, which is approximately 2 to 2.5 inches in length and is at this time currently Steri-Stripped and wrapped with Coban and is not actively bleeding.
ASSESSMENT:
1.  Acute on chronic COPD exacerbation.
2.  Community acquired pneumonia both resolving.  However, she may need home O2 for a short period of time.
3.  Generalized weakness and deconditioning secondary to the above.  Also sustained a fall secondary to instability and not using her walker or calling for assistance.  The patient stated that she knew better and she should have called for assistance and she had been told repeatedly from her family members and staff to call for assistance if she needed to get out of bed.
PLAN:
1.  I will have PT and OT evaluate the patient and give recommendation to safety and appliance use at home i.e. walker.  Myself and one of her daughter's spoke today about the fact that she generally lives independently at the Brooke and she may need assisted living along with physical therapy and oxygen for a period of time rather than going back to independent living.
2.  We will obtain an orthopedic consult secondary to her fall to evaluate her x-rays and function.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm doing okay, thank you.
[doctor] that's good to hear. i understand that you had a fall yesterday. can you tell me what happened?

"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
I was kindly asked to see this patient for transesophageal echocardiogram performance by Dr. A and Neurology.  Please see also my cardiovascular consultation dictated separately.  But essentially, this is a pleasant 72-year-old woman admitted to the hospital with a large right MCA CVA causing a left-sided neurological deficit incidentally found to have atrial fibrillation on telemetry.  She has been recommended for a transesophageal echocardiogram for cardioembolic source of her CNS insult.
I discussed the procedure in detail with the patient as well as with her daughter, who was present at the patient's bedside with the patient's verbal consent.  I then performed a risk/benefit/alternative analysis with benefits being more definitive exclusion of intracardiac thrombus as well as assessment for intracardiac shunts; alternatives being transthoracic echo imaging, which she had already had, with an inherent false negativity for this indication as well as empiric medical management, which the patient was not interested in; risks including, but not limited to, and the patient was aware this was not an all-inclusive list, of oversedation from conscious sedation, risk of aspiration pneumonia from regurgitation of stomach contents, risk of oropharyngeal, esophageal, oral, tracheal, pulmonary and/or gastric perforation, hemorrhage, or tear.  The patient expressed understanding of this risk/benefit/alternative analysis, had the opportunity to ask questions, which I invited from her and her daughter, all of which were answered to their self-stated satisfaction.  The patient then stated in a clear competent and coherent fashion that she wished to go forward with the transesophageal echocardiogram.
PROCEDURE:
The appropriate time-out procedure was performed as per Medical Center protocol under my direct supervision with appropriate identification of the patient, position, physician, procedure documentation; there were no safety issues identified by staff nor myself.  She received 20 cc of viscous lidocaine for topical oral anesthetic effect.  She received a total of 4 mg of Versed and 100 micrograms of fentanyl utilizing titrated conscious sedation with continuous hemodynamic and oximetric monitoring with reasonable effect.  The multi-plane probe was passed using digital guidance for several passes, after an oral bite block had been put into place for protection of oral dentition.  This was placed into the posterior oropharynx and advanced into the esophagus, then advanced into the stomach and then rotated and withdrawn and removed with adequate imaging obtained throughout.  She was recovered as per the Medical Center conscious sedation protocol, and there were no apparent complications of the procedure.
FINDINGS:
Normal left ventricular size and systolic function.  LVEF of 60%.  Mild left atrial enlargement.  Normal right atrial size.  Normal right ventricular size and systolic function.  No left ventricular wall motion abnormalities identified.  The four pulmonary veins are identified.  The left atrial appendage is interrogated, including with Doppler and color flow, and while there is good to-and-fro motion seen, echo smoke is seen, and in fact, an intracardiac thrombus is identified and circumscribed at 1.83 cm in circumference at the base of the left atrial appendage.  No intracardiac vegetations nor endocarditis seen on any of the intracardiac valves.  The mitral valve is seen.  There is mild mitral regurgitation with two jets.  No mitral stenosis.  Four pulmonary veins were identified without reversible pulmonary venous flow.  There are three cusps of the aortic valve seen.  No aortic stenosis.  There is trace aortic insufficiency.  There is trace pulmonic insufficiency.  The pulmonary artery is seen and is within normal limits.  There is trace to mild tricuspid regurgitation.  Unable to estimate PA systolic pressure accurately; however, on the recent transthoracic echocardiogram (which I would direct the reader to) on January 5, 2010, RVSP was calculated at 40 mmHg on that study.  E wave velocity on average is 0.95 m/sec with a deceleration time of 232 milliseconds.  The proximal aorta is within normal limits, annulus 1.19 cm, sinuses of Valsalva 2.54 cm, ascending aorta 2.61 cm.  The intra-atrial septum is identified as are the SVC and IVC, and these are within normal limits.  The intra-atrial septum is interrogated with color flow as well as agitated D5W and there is no evidence of intracardiac shunting, including no atrial septal defect nor patent foramen ovale.  No pericardial effusion.  There is mild nonmobile descending aortic atherosclerosis seen.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Normal left ventricular size and systolic function.  Left ventricular ejection fraction visually estimated at 60% without regional wall motion abnormalities.
2.  Mild left atrial enlargement.
3.  Intracardiac thrombus identified at the base of the left atrial appendage.
4.  Mild mitral regurgitation with two jets.
5.  Mild nonmobile descending aortic atherosclerosis.
Compared to the transthoracic echocardiogram done previously, other than identification of the intracardiac thrombus, other findings appear quite similar.
These results have been discussed with Dr. A of inpatient Internal Medicine service as well as the patient, who was recovering from conscious sedation, and her daughter with the patient's verbal consent.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] i'm feeling okay, a bit groggy still.
[doctor] that's normal after receiving conscious sedation. i have some good news and some concerning news regarding your echocardiogram results. would you like me to go over them with you?
[patient] yes, please do.
[doctor] your left ventricular size and systolic function are normal, which is great news. however, we did find a thrombus, or a blood clot, in the left atrial appendage of your heart. this could be a source of your neurological deficit. we also found mild mitral regurgitation with two jets and mild nonmobile descending aortic atherosclerosis.
[patient] what does that mean for me?
[doctor] well, the thrombus is concerning because it could increase your risk for stroke. we will need to start you on blood thinners immediately to prevent any clots from forming. the mild mitral regurgitation and atherosclerosis are not as concerning, but we will monitor them closely.
[patient] okay, i understand. what are the next steps?
[doctor] we will consult with a hematologist to determine the best blood thinner for you and adjust your dose accordingly. we will also monitor your heart closely and schedule a follow-up echocardiogram to check on the thrombus and the other findings. in the meantime, it's important to take your medications as prescribed and follow up with all of your appointments.
[patient] okay, thank you for explaining everything to me.
[doctor] of course, it's important that you understand your health and treatment plan. do you have any other questions or concerns?
[patient] no, i think i'm good for now.
[doctor] alright, feel free to call us if anything comes up. take care.","[doctor] hey there, how's it going after the procedure?
[patient] um, feeling okay, just a bit groggy still.
[doctor] yeah, that's totally normal after getting conscious sedation. so, i have some good news and some not-so-good news about your echocardiogram results. do you want me to go over them with you?
[patient] mm-hmm, please do.
[doctor] okay, so your left ventricular size and systolic function are looking good, which is great news. however, we did find a blood clot, or thrombus, in the left atrial appendage of your heart. this could be linked to your neurological deficit. we also found mild mitral regurgitation with two jets and mild nonmobile descending aortic atherosclerosis.
[patient] what does that mean for me?
[doctor] well, the blood clot is concerning because it could increase your risk of stroke. we need to start you on blood thinners right away to prevent any clots from forming. the mild mitral regurgitation and atherosclerosis aren't as concerning, but we'll keep a close eye on them.
[patient] okay, got it. what's the next step?
[doctor] alright, so we're gonna consult with a hematologist to determine the best blood thinner for you and adjust your dose accordingly. we'll also monitor your heart closely and schedule a follow-up echocardiogram to check on the thrombus and the other findings. in the meantime, it's important to take your meds as prescribed and come to all your appointments.

"REASON FOR EXAM:
Aortic valve replacement.  Assessment of stenotic valve.  Evaluation for thrombus on the valve.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Atrial valve replacement.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
Moderate stenosis of aortic valve replacement.  Mild mitral regurgitation.  Normal left ventricular function.
PROCEDURES IN DETAIL:
The procedure was explained to the patient with risks and benefits.  The patient agreed and signed the consent form.  The patient received a total of 3 mg of Versed and 50 mcg of fentanyl for conscious sedation and pain control.  The oropharynx anesthetized with benzocaine spray and lidocaine solution.
Esophageal intubation was done with no difficulty with the second attempt.  In a semi-Fowler position, the probe was passed to transthoracic views at about 40 to 42 cm.  Multiple pictures obtained.  Assessment of the peak velocity was done later.
The probe was pulled to the mid esophageal level.  Different pictures including short-axis views of the aortic valve was done.  Extubation done with no problems and no blood on the probe.  The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate postprocedure complications.
INTERPRETATION:
The left atrium was mildly dilated.  No masses or thrombi were seen.  The left atrial appendage was free of thrombus.  Pulse wave interrogation showed peak velocities of 60 cm per second.
The left ventricle was normal in size and contractility with mild LVH.  EF is normal and preserved.
The right atrium and right ventricle were both normal in size.
Mitral valve showed no vegetations or prolapse.  There was mild-to-moderate regurgitation on color flow interrogation.  Aortic valve was well-seated mechanical valve, bileaflet with acoustic shadowing beyond the valve noticed.  No perivalvular leak was noticed.  There was increased velocity across the valve with peak velocity of 3.2 m/sec with calculated aortic valve area by continuity equation at 1.2 cm2 indicative of moderate aortic valve stenosis based on criteria for native heart valves.
No AIC.
Pulmonic valve was somewhat difficult to see because of acoustic shadowing from the aortic valve.  Overall showed no abnormalities.  The tricuspid valve was structurally normal.
Interatrial septum appeared to be intact, confirmed by color flow interrogation as well as agitated saline contrast study.
The aorta and aortic arch were unremarkable.  No dissection.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Mildly dilated left atrium.
2.  Mild-to-moderate regurgitation.
3.  Well-seated mechanical aortic valve with peak velocity of 3.2 m/sec and calculated valve area of 1.2 cm2 consistent with moderate aortic stenosis.  Reevaluation in two to three years with transthoracic echocardiogram will be recommended.","[doctor] hi, how are you today?
[patient] hi, i'm doing okay. a little sore from the procedure yesterday.
[doctor] yes, i can imagine. so, we did an echocardiogram yesterday to assess your aortic valve replacement. how are you feeling?
[patient] well, i'm a little worried about the results. can you tell me what you found?
[doctor] of course. so, we did find a moderate stenosis of your aortic valve replacement. we also noticed some mild mitral regurgitation, but your left ventricular function is normal.
[patient] okay, what does that mean for me?
[doctor] well, we'll need to re-evaluate you in two to three years with another echocardiogram to see if the stenosis has progressed. depending on the results, we may need to consider another procedure. but for now, we'll just keep an eye on it.
[patient] what about the regurgitation?
[doctor] the mitral regurgitation is not severe enough to require any immediate action. we'll just continue to monitor it as well.
[patient] okay. is there anything else i should be concerned about?
[doctor] no, everything else looked normal. your left atrium was mildly dilated, but there were no masses or thrombi. the right atrium and right ventricle were both normal in size, and your tricuspid valve was structurally normal. the interatrial septum also appeared to be intact.
[patient] that's good to hear.
[doctor] yes, overall, the procedure went well and there were no immediate complications. we'll just need to keep an eye on the stenosis and regurgitation and re-evaluate you in a few years.

"INDICATION FOR STUDY:
Elevated cardiac enzymes, fullness in chest, abnormal EKG, and risk factors.
MEDICATIONS:
Femara, verapamil, Dyazide, Hyzaar, glyburide, and metformin.
BASELINE EKG:
Sinus rhythm at 84 beats per minute, poor anteroseptal R-wave progression, mild lateral ST abnormalities.
EXERCISE RESULTS:
1.  The patient exercised for 3 minutes stopping due to fatigue.  No chest pain.
2.  Heart rate increased from 84 to 138 or 93% of maximum predicted heart rate.  Blood pressure rose from 150/88 to 210/100.  There was a slight increase in her repolorization abnormalities in a non-specific pattern.
NUCLEAR PROTOCOL:
Same day rest/stress protocol was utilized with 11 mCi for the rest dose and 33 mCi for the stress test.
NUCLEAR RESULTS:
1.  Nuclear perfusion imaging, review of the raw projection data reveals adequate image acquisition.  The resting images showed decreased uptake in the anterior wall.  However the apex is spared of this defect.  There is no significant change between rest and stress images.  The sum score is 0.
2.  The Gated SPECT shows moderate LVH with slightly low EF of 48%.
IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of exercise induced ischemia at a high myocardial workload.  This essentially excludes obstructive CAD as a cause of her elevated troponin.
2.  Mild hypertensive cardiomyopathy with an EF of 48%.

[patient] no, i didn't.
[doctor] okay. based on the results, we decided to do a nuclear perfusion imaging test that showed no evidence of exercise-induced ischemia at a high myocardial workload. your sum score was 0. however, the test did reveal that you have mild hypertensive cardiomyopathy with an ef of 48%. we also noticed that your blood pressure was suboptimally controlled during today's exam.
[patient] what does all of that mean?
[doctor] well, it essentially excludes obstructive cad as a cause of your elevated troponin, which is good news. however, it does show that you have some heart muscle thickening due to your high blood pressure. we'll need to work on getting your blood pressure under control and monitor your heart function. we also noticed that you have poor exercise capacity due to cardiovascular deconditioning, which means we will need to work on improving your fitness level.
[patient] what will the treatment plan be?
[doctor] we will need to adjust your medications to better control your blood pressure and monitor your heart function with regular check-ups. we will also refer you to a cardiac rehabilitation program to improve your fitness level.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] um, not feeling too great, doctor. i've been experiencing some fullness in my chest and my cardiac enzymes were elevated.
[doctor] uh huh, let me take a look at your medical notes here. it says that you are taking femara, verapamil, dyazide, hyzaar, glyburide, and metformin. is that correct?

"CC:
Progressive lower extremity weakness.
HX:
This 52y/o RHF had a h/o right frontal glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) diagnosed by brain biopsy/partial resection, on 1/15/1991. She had been healthy until 1/6/91, when she experienced a generalized tonic-clonic type seizure during the night. She subsequently underwent an MRI brain scan and was found to have a right frontal enhancing lesion in the mesial aspect of the right frontal lobe at approximately the level of the coronal suture. There was minimal associated edema and no mass effect. Following extirpation of the tumor mass, she underwent radioactive Iodine implantation and 6020cGy radiation therapy in 35 fractions. In 11/91 she received BCNU and Procarbazine chemotherapy protocols. This was followed by four courses of 5FU/Carboplatin (3/92, 6/92, 9/92
10/92) chemotherapy.
On 10/12/92 she presented for her 4th course of 5FU/Carboplatin and complained of non-radiating dull low back pain, and proximal lower extremity weakness, but was still able to ambulate. She denied any bowel/bladder difficulty.
PMH:
s/p oral surgery for wisdom tooth extraction.
FHX/SHX:
1-2 ppd cigarettes. rare ETOH use. Father died of renal CA.
MEDS:
Decadron 12mg/day.
EXAM:
Vitals unremarkable.
MS: Unremarkable.
Motor: 5/5 BUE, LE: 4+/5- prox, 5/5 distal to hips. Normal tone and muscle bulk.
Sensory: No deficits appreciated.
Coord: Unremarkable.
Station: No mention in record of being tested.
Gait: Mild difficulty climbing stairs.
Reflexes: 1+/1+ throughout and symmetric. Plantar responses were down-going bilaterally.
INITIAL IMPRESSION:
Steroid myopathy. Though there was enough of a suspicion of ""drop"" metastasis that an MRI of the L-spine was obtained.
COURSE:
The MRI L-spine revealed fine linear enhancement along the dorsal aspect of the conus medullaris, suggestive of subarachnoid seeding of tumor. No focal mass or cord compression was visualized. CSF examination revealed: 19RBC, 22WBC, 17 Lymphocytes, and 5 histiocytes, Glucose 56, Protein 150. Cytology (negative). The patient was discharged home on 10/17/92, but experienced worsening back pain and lower extremity weakness and became predominantly wheelchair bound within 4 months. She was last seen on 3/3/93 and showed signs of worsening weakness (left hemiplegia: R > L) as her tumor grew and spread. She then entered a hospice.","[doctor] hi, how are you?
[patient] hi, i'm not doing well.

[patient] i'm having progressive lower extremity weakness.
[doctor] i see. based on your medical history, you had a right frontal glioblastoma multiforme diagnosed by brain biopsy/partial resection. do you still have this?
[patient] yes, i underwent treatment for this including radiation therapy and chemotherapy.
[doctor] i see. when did you start experiencing the lower extremity weakness?
[patient] i complained of non-radiating dull low back pain and proximal lower extremity weakness during my fourth course of chemotherapy for 5fu/carboplatin on 10/12/92.
[doctor] okay, and have you experienced any bowel/bladder difficulty?
[patient] no, i have not.
[doctor] based on your current symptoms, i suspect steroid myopathy. however, we need to rule out the possibility of ""drop"" metastasis. an mri of the l-spine was obtained, and the results showed fine linear enhancement along the dorsal aspect of the conus medullaris, suggestive of subarachnoid seeding of tumor. no focal mass or cord compression was visualized. csf examination revealed 19rbc, 22wbc, 17 lymphocytes, and 5 histiocytes, glucose 56, protein 150. cytology was negative. unfortunately, it seems that your tumor has grown and spread, causing worsening back pain and lower extremity weakness. you are now predominantly wheelchair-bound and will need to enter a hospice.
[patient] okay, thank you for your help.","[doctor] hi, how are you?
[patient] um, hi. i'm not doing too well.

[patient] well, i've been having some lower extremity weakness that seems to be getting worse.
[doctor] mm-hmm, i see. based on your medical history, you had a right frontal glioblastoma multiforme diagnosed by brain biopsy/partial resection. is that still the case?
[patient] yes, that's right. i've been treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy.
[doctor] okay, got it. when did you first start experiencing the lower extremity weakness?
[patient] um, i noticed some low back pain and weakness in my legs during my fourth round of chemotherapy on 10/12/92.
[doctor] i see. have you had any issues with your bowel or bladder?
[patient] no, thankfully i haven't.
[doctor] based on your symptoms, i suspect steroid myopathy. however, we need to make sure it's not ""drop"" metastasis. we got an mri of your spine, which showed some tumor growth and spreading. unfortunately, it's causing your pain and weakness to worsen, and you'll need to enter a hospice.

COURSE:
CBC, GS, PT, PTT, ESR, FT4, TSH, ANA, Vit B12, Folate, VDRL and Urinalysis were normal. MRI T-spine, 10/27/92, was unremarkable. MRI Brain, 10/28/92, revealed multiple areas of abnormally increased signal on T2 weighted images in the white matter regions of the right corpus callosum, periventricular region, brachium pontis and right pons. The appearance of the lesions was felt to be strongly suggestive of multiple sclerosis. 10/28/92, Lumbar puncture revealed the following CSF results: RBC 1, WBC 9 (8 lymphocytes, 1 histiocyte), Glucose 55mg/dl, Protein 46mg/dl (normal 15-45), CSF IgG 7.5mg/dl (normal 0.0-6.2), CSF IgG index 1.3 (normal 0.0-0.7), agarose gel electrophoresis revealed oligoclonal bands in the gamma region which were not seen on the serum sample. Beta-2 microglobulin was unremarkable. An abnormal left tibial somatosensory evoked potential was noted consistent with central conduction slowing. Visual and Brainstem Auditory evoked potentials were normal. HTLV-1 titers were negative. CSF cultures and cytology were negative. She was not treated with medications as her symptoms were primarily sensory and non-debilitating, and she was discharged home.
She returned on 11/7/92 as her symptoms of RUE dysesthesia, lower extremity paresthesia and weakness, all worsened. On 11/6/92, she developed slow slurred speech and had marked difficulty expressing her thoughts. She also began having difficulty emptying her bladder. Her 11/7/92 exam was notable for normal vital signs, lying motionless with eyes open and nodding and rhythmically blinking every few minutes. She was oriented to place and time of day, but not to season, day of the week and she did not know who she was. She had a leftward gaze preference and right lower facial weakness. Her RLE was spastic with sustained ankle clonus. There was dysesthetic sensory perception in the RUE. Jaw jerk and glabellar sign were present.
MRI brain, 11/7/92, revealed multiple enhancing lesions in the peritrigonal region and white matter of the centrum semiovale. The right peritrigonal region is more prominent than on prior study. The left centrum semiovale lesion has less enhancement than previously. Multiple other white matter lesions are demonstrated on the right side, in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, the anterior periventricular white matter, optic radiations and cerebellum. The peritrigonal lesions on both sides have increased in size since the 10/92 MRI. The findings were felt more consistent with demyelinating disease and less likely glioma. Post-viral encephalitis, Rapidly progressive demyelinating disease and tumor were in the differential diagnosis. Lumbar Puncture, 11/8/92, revealed: RBC 2, WBC 12 (12 lymphocytes), Glucose 57, Protein 51 (elevated), cytology and cultures were negative. HIV 1 titer was negative. Urine drug screen, negative. A stereotactic brain biopsy of the right parieto-occipital region was consistent with demyelinating disease. She was treated with Decadron 6mg IV qhours and Cytoxan 0.75gm/m2 (1.25gm). On 12/3/92, she has a focal motor seizure with rhythmic jerking of the LUE, loss of consciousness and rightward eye deviation. EEG revealed diffuse slowing with frequent right-sided sharp discharges. She was placed on Dilantin. She became depressed.","[doctor] hi, can you tell me what brought you in today?

Urinalysis revealed 1-2RBC, 2-3WBC and bacteria were noted. Repeat Urinalysis was negative the next day. PT, PTT, CXR and GS were normal. CBC revealed 10.4WBC with 7.1Granulocytes. HCT, 10/18/95, revealed hydrocephalus. MRI, 10/18/95, revealed ventriculomegaly of the lateral, 3rd and 4th ventricles. There was enhancement of the meninges about the prepontine cisterna and internal auditory canals, and enhancement of a scar or inflammed lining of the foramen of Magendie. These changes were felt suggestive of bacterial or granulomatous meningitis. The patient underwent ventriculostomy on 10/19/94. CSF taken on 10/19/94 via V-P shunt insertion revealed: 22 WBC (21 lymphocytes, 1 monocyte), 380 RBC, Glucose 58, Protein 29, GS negative, Cultures (bacterial, fungal, AFB) negative, Cryptococcal Antigen and India Ink were negative. Numerous CSF samples were taken from the lumbar region and shunt reservoir and these were consistantly unremarkable except for an occasional CSF protein of up to 99mg/dl. Serum and CSF toxoplasma titers and ACE levels were negative on multiple occasions. VDRL and HIV testing was unremarkable. 10/27/94 and 10/31/94 CSF cultures taken from the cervical region eventually grew non-encapsulated crytococcus neoformans. The patient was treated with amphotericin and showed some improvement. However, scarring had probably occurred by then and the V-P shunt was left in place.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?

[doctor] got it. how long have you been dealing with these headaches?
[patient] about a month now. they seem to be worse in the early morning.
[doctor] have you noticed any other symptoms besides the headaches?
[patient] yeah, i've been having some mild blurred vision, difficulty concentrating, and i haven't been eating much. i've lost some weight in the past three months too.
[doctor] have you ever experienced headaches like this before?
[patient] i've had occasional headaches since the early 1980s, but they were different than these. they weren't as severe and didn't come with all these other symptoms.
[doctor] okay, do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?
[patient] yeah, i have ulcerative colitis and hypertension.
[doctor] any family history of migraine?
[patient] no, there's no family history of that. my mgf had a stroke, but my parents were healthy.
[doctor] alright, let me take a look at you and perform a physical examination to get a better idea of what's going on.
[patient] mm-hmm, sounds good.
[doctor] so, i noticed some papilledema in your eyes, with nystagmus on right and leftward gaze, and unsteady station. your gait is wide-based, ataxic, magnetic, and apraxic. these findings suggest that you may have hydrocephalus. i recommend an mri to confirm the diagnosis.
[patient] okay, thank you.
[doctor] the mri revealed ventriculomegaly of the lateral, 3rd and 4th ventricles. this could mean you have bacterial or granulomatous meningitis. i recommend a csf test to confirm the diagnosis.
[patient] sure thing.
[doctor] the csf test revealed 22 wbc (21 lymphocytes, 1 monocyte), 380 rbc, glucose 58, protein 29, and negative gs. however, the csf cultures taken eventually grew non-encapsulated cryptococcus neoformans. this condition can be treated with amphotericin, and you have shown some improvement.",3
"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Syncopal episodes with injury.  See electrophysiology consultation.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Normal electrophysiologic studies.
2.  No inducible arrhythmia.
3.  Procainamide infusion negative for Brugada syndrome.
PROCEDURES:
1.  Comprehensive electrophysiology studies with attempted arrhythmia induction.
2.  IV Procainamide infusion for Brugada syndrome.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
The patient gave informed consent for comprehensive electrophysiologic studies.  She received small amounts of intravenous fentanyl and Versed for conscious sedation.  Then 1% lidocaine local anesthesia was used.  Three catheters were placed via the right femoral vein; 5-French catheters to the right ventricular apex and right atrial appendage; and a 6-French catheter to the His bundle.  Later in the procedure, the RV apical catheter was moved to RV outflow tract.
ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL FINDINGS:
Conduction intervals in sinus rhythm were normal.  Sinus cycle length 768 ms, PA interval 24 ms, AH interval 150 ms, HV interval 46 ms.  Sinus node recovery times were also normal at 1114 ms.  Corrected sinus node recovery time was normal at 330 ms.  One-to-one AV conduction was present to cycle length 480 ms, AH interval 240 ms, HV interval 54 ms.  AV nodal effective refractory period was normal, 440 ms at drive cycle length 600 ms.  RA-ERP was 250 ms.  With ventricular pacing, there was VA disassociation present.
Since there was no evidence for dual AV nodal pathways, and poor retrograde conduction, isoproterenol infusion was not performed to look for SVT.
Programmed ventricular stimulation was performed at both right ventricular apex and right ventricular outflow tracts.  Drive cycle length 600, 500, and 400 ms was used with triple extrastimuli down to troubling intervals of 180 ms, or refractoriness.  There was no inducible VT.  Longest run was 5 beats of polymorphic VT, which is a nonspecific finding.  From the apex 400-600 with 2 extrastimuli were delivered, again with no inducible VT.
Procainamide was then infused, 20 mg/kg over 10 minutes.  There were no ST segment changes.  HV interval after IV Procainamide remained normal at 50 ms.
ASSESSMENT:
Normal electrophysiologic studies.  No evidence for sinus node dysfunction or atrioventricular block.  No inducible supraventricular tachycardia or ventricular tachycardia, and no evidence for Brugada syndrome.
PLAN:
The patient will follow up with Dr. X.  She recently had an ambulatory EEG.  I will plan to see her again on a p.r.n. basis should she develop a recurrent syncopal episodes.  Reveal event monitor was considered, but not placed since she has only had one single episode.","[doctor]: hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient]: i'm doing well, thank you.
[doctor]: great. so, i reviewed the results of your electrophysiology studies and i'm glad to inform you that the results were normal. there was no evidence for sinus node dysfunction or atrioventricular block. also, there was no inducible supraventricular tachycardia or ventricular tachycardia, and no evidence for brugada syndrome.
[patient]: that's a relief to hear.
[doctor]: yes, it is. however, since you recently had a syncopal episode, i will plan to see you again on a p.r.n. basis should you develop a recurrent syncopal episode. in the meantime, you will follow up with dr. x, and a reveal event monitor was considered but not placed since you have only had one single episode. do you have any questions or concerns?
[patient]: no, i think i'm good for now.
[doctor]: alright then, if you have any concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.","[doctor]: hi there, how are you feeling today?

"DOBUTAMINE STRESS ECHOCARDIOGRAM,REASON FOR EXAM:
Chest discomfort, evaluation for coronary artery disease.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
The patient was brought to the cardiac center.  Cardiac images at rest were obtained in the parasternal long and short axis, apical four and apical two views followed by starting with a dobutamine drip in the usual fashion at 10 mcg/kg per minute for low dose, increased every 2 to 3 minutes by 10 mcg/kg per minute.  The patient maximized at 30 mcg/kg per minute.  Images were obtained at that level after adding 0.7 mg of atropine to reach maximal heart rate of 145.  Maximal images were obtained in the same windows of parasternal long and short axis, apical four and apical two windows.
Wall motion assessed at all levels as well as at recovery.
The patient got nauseated, had some mild shortness of breath.  No angina during the procedure and the maximal amount of dobutamine was 30 mcg/kg per minute.
The resting heart rate was 78 with the resting blood pressure 186/98.  Heart rate reduced by the vasodilator effects of dobutamine to 130/80.  Maximal heart rate achieved was 145, which is 85% of age-predicted heart rate.
The EKG at rest showed sinus rhythm with no ST-T wave depression suggestive of ischemia or injury.  Incomplete right bundle-branch block was seen.  The maximal stress test EKG showed sinus tachycardia.  There was subtle upsloping ST depression in III and aVF, which is a normal response to the tachycardia with dobutamine, but no significant depression suggestive of ischemia and no ST elevation seen.
No ventricular tachycardia or ventricular ectopy seen during the test.  The heart rate recovered in a normal fashion after using metoprolol 5 mg.
The heart images were somewhat suboptimal to evaluate because of obesity and some problems with the short axis windows mainly at peak exercise.
The EF at rest appeared to be normal at 55 to 60 with normal wall motion including anterior, anteroseptal, inferior, lateral, and septal walls at low dose.  All walls mentioned were augmented in a normal fashion.  At maximum dose, all walls were augmented on all views except for the short axis was foreshortened, was uncertain about the anterolateral wall at peak exercise; however, of the other views, the lateral wall was showing normal thickening and normal augmentation.  EF improved to about 70%.
The wall motion score was unchanged.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Maximal dobutamine stress echocardiogram test achieving more than 85% of age-predicted heart rate.
2.  Negative EKG criteria for ischemia.
3.  Normal augmentation at low and maximum stress test with some uncertainty about the anterolateral wall in peak exercise only on the short axis view.  This is considered the negative dobutamine stress echocardiogram test, medical management.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i am good, thank you.
[doctor] that's great to hear. so, we have received the results of your dobutamine stress echocardiogram test. do you have a moment to discuss them?
[patient] yes, of course.
[doctor] okay, so the test was performed to evaluate for coronary artery disease due to your chest discomfort. during the test, we did not observe any angina and your maximal heart rate achieved was 145 which is 85% of your age-predicted heart rate.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] the ekg at rest showed no st-t wave depression suggestive of ischemia or injury. there was a subtle upsloping st depression in iii and avf but it was a normal response to the tachycardia with dobutamine and there was no significant depression suggestive of ischemia, and no st elevation seen.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] the wall motion was assessed at all levels, and at low and maximum stress test, there was normal augmentation. however, there was some uncertainty about the anterolateral wall in peak exercise only on the short axis view. but, the lateral wall was showing normal thickening and normal augmentation. the ef at rest appeared to be normal at 55 to 60 which improved up to 70% at maximum dose.
[patient] i see.
[doctor] based on the test results, i am happy to inform you that the test is considered negative for any coronary artery disease. however, we still recommend medical management, just to be on the safe side.

"CC:
Progressive loss of color vision OD,HX:
58 y/o female presents with a one year history of progressive loss of color vision. In the past two months she has developed blurred vision and a central scotoma OD. There are no symptoms of photopsias, diplopia, headache, or eye pain. There are no other complaints. There have been mild fluctuations of her symptoms, but her vision has never returned to its baseline prior to symptom onset one year ago.
EXAM:
Visual acuity with correction: 20/25+1 OD; 20/20-1 OS. Pupils were 3.5mm OU. There was a 0.8 log unit RAPD OD. Intraocular pressures were 25 and 24, OD and OS respectively; and there was an increase to 27 on upgaze OD, but no increase on upgaze OS. Optic disk pallor was evident OD, but not OS. Additionally, there was a small area of peripheral chorioretinal scarring in the inferotemporal area of the right eye. Foveal flicker fusion occurred at a frequency of 21.9 OD and 30.7 OS. Color plate testing scores: 6/14 OD and 10/14 OS. Goldman visual field examination showed an enlarged and deepened blind spot with an infero-temporal defect especially in the smaller diopters.
IMPRESSION ON 2/6/89:
Optic neuropathy/atrophy OD, rule out mass lesion affecting optic nerve. Particular attention was paid to the area of the optic canal, cavernous sinus and sphenoid sinus.
BRAIN CT W/CONTRAST, 2/13/89:
Enhancing calcified lesion in the posterior aspect of the right optic nerve, probable meningioma.
MRI ORBITS W/ AND W/OUT GADOLINIUM CONTRAST, 4/26/89:
7x3mm irregular soft tissue mass just inferior and lateral to the optic nerve OD. The mass is just proximal to the orbital apex. There is relatively homogeneous enhancement of the mass. The findings are most consistent with meningioma.
MRI 1995:
Mild enlargement of tumor with possible slight extension into the right cavernous sinus.
COURSE:
Resection and biopsy were deferred due to risk of blindness, and suspicion that the tumor was a slow growing meningioma. 3 years after initial evaluation Hertel measurements indicated a 3mm proptosis OD. Visual field testing revealed gradual worsening of deficits seen on her initial Goldman visual field exam. There was greater red color desaturation of the temporal field OD. Visual acuity had decreased from 20/20 to 20/64, OD. All other deficits seen on her initial exam remained stable or slightly worsened. By 1996 she continued to be followed at 6 months intervals and had not undergone surgical resection.","[doctor]: hello, how are you today? 
[patient]: i am okay, thanks for asking. 
[doctor]: i have reviewed your medical history and it looks like you have been experiencing progressive loss of color vision in your right eye for about a year now. have you noticed any other symptoms? 
[patient]: no, other than blurred vision and a central scotoma in my right eye. 
[doctor]: i see. during your last examination, it was noted that there was a 0.8 log unit rapd in your right eye and optic disk pallor as well. did you experience any pain or discomfort during that time? 
[patient]: no, i did not. 
[doctor]: based on your medical history and examination, it seems like you may have an optic neuropathy/atrophy in your right eye. however, we need to rule out the possibility of a mass lesion affecting the optic nerve. we may need to pay particular attention to the area of the optic canal, cavernous sinus, and sphenoid sinus. 
[patient]: okay, what are the next steps? 
[doctor]: we will need to conduct a brain ct scan with contrast to get a clearer picture of any possible mass lesion. we will also conduct an mri orbit with and without gadolinium contrast to confirm the diagnosis. 
[patient]: okay, when can we schedule these tests? 
[doctor]: we can schedule them as soon as possible to confirm our diagnosis and proceed with treatment. it is important to note that surgical resection and biopsy may be deferred due to the risk of blindness and the suspicion that the tumor is a slow-growing meningioma. we will monitor the tumor at six-month intervals to determine if there are any changes in size or symptoms. 
[patient]: i understand. thank you for explaining everything to me. 
[doctor]: you're welcome. we will keep you updated on any developments and next steps.","[doctor]: hi there, how's it going? 
[patient]: um, i'm doing alright, thanks. 
[doctor]: so, i went over your medical history, and it looks like you've been having some issues with your color vision in your right eye for about a year now. have you noticed anything else going on? 
[patient]: nope, just some blurred vision and a scotoma in my right eye. 
[doctor]: got it. last time we checked, there was some optic disk pallor and a 0.8 log unit rapd in your right eye. did you feel any pain or discomfort during that time? 
[patient]: no, not really. 
[doctor]: based on your history and exam, it seems like you might have an optic neuropathy or atrophy in your right eye. however, we need to make sure there's no mass lesion affecting your optic nerve, so we'll want to take a closer look at the optic canal, cavernous sinus, and sphenoid sinus. 
[patient]: okay, what's the next step? 
[doctor]: we'll need to do a brain ct scan with contrast and an mri orbit with and without gadolinium contrast to confirm the diagnosis. 
[patient]: alright, when can we schedule those tests? 
[doctor]: we can get those scheduled asap to move forward with treatment. it's important to note that surgical resection and biopsy may not be recommended because of the risk of blindness and the likelihood that the tumor is a slow-growing meningioma. we'll keep an eye on it every six months to check for any changes in size or symptoms. 
[patient]: i see. thanks for explaining everything to me. 
[doctor]: no problem. we'll keep you posted on any updates or next steps.",3
"ADMITTING DIAGNOSES:
Left renal cell carcinoma, left renal cyst.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Left renal cell carcinoma, left renal cyst.
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  Coronary artery disease.
PROCEDURES:
Robotic-Assisted laparoscopic left renal cyst decortication and cystoscopy.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. ABC is a 70-year-old male who has been diagnosed with a left renal cell carcinoma with multiple renal cysts.  He has undergone MRI of the abdomen on June 18, 2008 revealing an enhancing mass of the upper pole of the left kidney consistent with his history of renal cell carcinoma.  Of note, there are no other enhancing solid masses seen on this MRI.  After discussion of multiple management strategies with the patient including:
1.  Left partial nephrectomy.
2.  Left radical nephrectomy.
3.  Left renal cyst decortication.  The patient is likely to undergo the latter procedure.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was admitted to undergo left renal cyst decortication as well as a cystoscopy.  Intraoperatively, approximately four enlarged renal cysts and six smaller renal cysts were initially removed.  The contents were aspirated and careful dissection of the cyst wall was performed.  Multiple specimens of the cyst wall were sent for pathology.  Approximately one liter of cystic fluid was drained during the procedure.  The renal bed was inspected for hemostasis, which appear to be adequate.  There were no complications with the procedure.  Single JP drain was left in place.  Additionally, the patient underwent flexible cystoscopy, which revealed no gross strictures or any other abnormalities in the penile nor prostatic urethra.  Furthermore, no gross lesions were encountered in the bladder.  The patient left OR with transfer to the PACU and subsequently to the hospital floor.
The patient's postoperative course was relatively uneventful.  His diet and activity were gradually advanced without complication.  On postoperative day #2, he was passing flatus and has had bowel movements.  His Jackson-Pratt drain was discontinued on postoperative day #3 that being the day of discharge.  His Foley catheter was removed on the morning of discharge and the patient subsequently passed the voiding trial without difficultly.  At the time of discharge, he was afebrile.  His vital signs indicated hemodynamic stability and he had no evidence of infection.  The patient was instructed to follow up with Dr. XYZ on 8/12/2008 at 1:50 p.m. and was given prescription for pain medications as well as laxative.

"HISTORY:
A 69-year-old female with past history of type II diabetes, atherosclerotic heart disease, hypertension, carotid stenosis.  The patient was status post coronary artery bypass surgery aortic valve repair at Shadyside Hospital.  The patient subsequently developed CVA.  She also developed thrombosis of the right arm, which ultimately required right hand amputation.  She was stabilized and eventually transferred to HealthSouth for further management.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Vital Signs:  Pulse of 90 and blood pressure 150/70.
Heart:  Sounds were heard, grade 2/6 systolic murmur at the precordium.
Chest:  Clinically clear.
Abdomen:  Some suprapubic tenderness.  Evidence of right lower arm amputation.
The patient was started on Prevacid 30 mg daily, levothyroxine 75 mcg a day, Toprol 25 mg twice a day, Zofran 4 mg q.6 h, Coumadin dose at 5 mg and was adjusted.  She was given a pain control using Vicodin and Percocet, amiodarone 200 mg a day, Lexapro 20 mg a day, Plavix 75 mg a day, fenofibrate 145 mg, Lasix 20 mg IV twice a day, Lantus 50 units at bedtime and Humalog 10 units a.c. and sliding scale insulin coverage.  Wound care to the right heel was supervised by Dr. X.  The patient initially was fed through NG tube, which was eventually discontinued.  Physical therapy was ordered.  The patient continued to do well.  She was progressively ambulated.  Her meds were continuously adjusted.  The patient's insulin was eventually changed from Lantus to Levemir 25 units twice a day.  Dr. Y also followed the patient closely for left heel ulcer.
LABORATORY DATA:
The latest cultures from left heel are pending.  Her electrolytes revealed sodium of 135 and potassium of 3.2.  Her potassium was switched to K-Dur 40 mEq twice a day.  Her blood chemistries are otherwise closely monitored.  INRs were obtained and were therapeutic.  Throughout her hospitalization, multiple cultures were also obtained.  Urine cultures grew Klebsiella.  She was treated with appropriate antibiotics.  Her detailed blood work is as in the chart.  Detailed radiological studies are as in the chart.  The patient made a steady progress and eventually plans were made to transfer the patient to ABC furthermore aggressive rehabilitation.
FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Atherosclerotic heart disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft.
2.  Valvular heart disease, status post aortic valve replacement.
3.  Right arm arterial thrombosis, status post amputation right lower arm.
4.  Hypothyroidism.
5.  Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, type 2.
6.  Urinary tract infection.
7.  Hypokalemia.
8.  Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
9.  Peripheral vascular occlusive disease.

"ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:
Upper respiratory illness with apnea, possible pertussis.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Upper respiratory illness with apnea, possible pertussis.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
OPERATIONS:
None,BRIEF HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:
This is a one plus-month-old female with respiratory symptoms for approximately a week prior to admission.  This involved cough, post-tussive emesis, questionable fever, but only 99.7.  Their usual doctor prescribed amoxicillin over the phone.  The coughing persisted and worsened.  She went to the ER, where sats were normal at baseline, but dropped into the 80s with coughing spells.  They did witness some apnea.  They gave some Rocephin, did some labs, and the patient was transferred to hospital.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
On admission, GENERAL:  Well-developed, well-nourished baby in no apparent distress. HEENT:  There was some nasal discharge.  Remainder of the HEENT was normal.  LUNG:  Had few rhonchi.  No retractions.  No significant coughing or apnea during the admission physical.  ABDOMEN:  Benign.  EXTREMITIES:  Were without any cyanosis.
SIGNIFICANT LABS AND X-RAYS:
She had a CBC done Garberville, which showed a white count of 12.4, with a differential of 10 segs, 82 lymphs, 8 monos, hemoglobin of 15, hematocrit 42, platelets 296,000, and a normal BMP.  An x-ray was done and I do not have an official interpretation, but to the admitting physician, Dr. X it showed no significant infiltrate.  Well at hospital, she had a rapid influenza swab done, which was negative.  She had a rapid RSV done, which is still not in the chart, but I believe I was told that it was negative.  She also had a pertussis PCR swab done and a pertussis culture done, neither of which has result in the chart.  I do know that the pertussis culture proved to be negative.
CONSULTATION:
Public Health Department was notified of a case of suspected pertussis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The baby was afebrile.  Required no oxygen in the hospital.  Actually fed reasonably well.  Did have one episode of coughing with slight emesis.  Appeared basically quite well between episodes.  Had no apnea witnessed and after overnight observation, the parents were anxious to go home.  The patient was started on Zithromax in the hospital.
CONDITION AND TREATMENT:
The patient was in stable condition and good condition on exam at the time and was discharged home on Zithromax to be followed up in the office within a week.
INSTRUCTIONS TO PATIENT:
Include usual diet and to follow up within a week, but certainly sooner if the coughing is worse and there is cyanosis or apnea again.","[doctor] hi, how are you doing today?

"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 48-year-old man who has had abdominal pain since October of last year associated with a 30-pound weight loss and then developed jaundice.  He had epigastric pain and was admitted to the hospital.  A thin-slice CT scan was performed, which revealed a 4 x 3 x 2 cm pancreatic mass with involved lymph nodes and ring enhancing lesions consistent with liver metastases.  The patient, additionally, had a questionable pseudocyst in the tail of the pancreas.  The patient underwent ERCP on 04/04/2007 with placement of a stent.  This revealed a strictured pancreatic duct, as well as strictured bile duct.  A 10-french x 9 cm stent was placed with good drainage.  The next morning, the patient felt quite a bit more comfortable.  He additionally had a modest drop in his bilirubin and other liver tests.  Of note, the patient has been having quite a bit of nausea during his admission.  This responded to Zofran.  It did not, initially, respond well to Phenergan, though after stent placement, he was significantly more comfortable and had less nausea, and in fact, had better response to the Phenergan itself.  At the time of discharge, the patient's white count was 9.4, hemoglobin 10.8, hematocrit 32 with a MCV of 79, platelet count of 585,000.  His sodium was 132, potassium 4.1, chloride 95, CO2 27, BUN of 8 with a creatinine of 0.3.  His bilirubin was 17.1, alk phos 273, AST 104, ALT 136, total protein 7.8 and albumin of 3.8.  He was tolerating a regular diet.  The patient had been on oral hypoglycemics as an outpatient, but in hospital, he was simply managed with an insulin sliding scale.  The patient will be transferred back to Pelican Bay, under the care of Dr. X at the infirmary.  He will be further managed for his diabetes there.  The patient will additionally undergo potential end of life meetings.  I discussed the potentials of chemotherapy with patient.  Certainly, there are modest benefits, which can be obtained with chemotherapy in metastatic pancreatic cancer, though at some cost with morbidity.  The patient will consider this and will discuss this further with Dr. X.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Phenergan 25 mg q.6. p.r.n.
2.  Duragesic patch 100 mcg q.3.d.
3.  Benadryl 25-50 mg p.o. q.i.d. for pruritus.
4.  Sliding scale will be discontinued at the time of discharge and will be reinstituted on arrival at Pelican Bay Infirmary.
5.  The patient had initially been on enalapril here.  His hypertension will be managed by Dr. X as well.
PLAN:
The patient should return for repeat ERCP if there are signs of stent occlusion such as fever, increased bilirubin, worsening pain.  In the meantime, he will be kept on a regular diet and activity per Dr. X.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?

"ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:
1. Respiratory arrest.
2 . End-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
3. Coronary artery disease.
4. History of hypertension.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1. Status post-respiratory arrest.
2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
3. Congestive heart failure.
4. History of coronary artery disease.
5. History of hypertension.
SUMMARY:
The patient is a 49-year-old man who was admitted to the hospital in respiratory distress, and had to be intubated shortly after admission to the emergency room. The patient’s past history is notable for a history of coronary artery disease with prior myocardial infarctions in 1995 and 1999. The patient has recently been admitted to the hospital with pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient has been smoking up until three to four months previously. On the day of admission, the patient had the sudden onset of severe dyspnea and called an ambulance. The patient denied any gradual increase in wheezing, any increase in cough, any increase in chest pain, any increase in sputum prior to the onset of his sudden dyspnea.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL: Showed a well-developed, slightly obese man who was in extremis.
NECK: Supple, with no jugular venous distension.
HEART: Showed tachycardia without murmurs or gallops.
PULMONARY: Status showed decreased breath sounds, but no clear-cut rales or wheezes.
EXTREMITIES: Free of edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was admitted to the Special Care Unit and intubated. He received intravenous antibiotic therapy with Levaquin. He received intravenous diuretic therapy. He received hand-held bronchodilator therapy. The patient also was given intravenous steroid therapy with Solu-Medrol. The patient’s course was one of gradual improvement, and after approximately three days, the patient was extubated. He continued to be quite dyspneic, with wheezes as well as basilar rales. After pulmonary consultation was obtained, the pulmonary consultant felt that the patient’s overall clinical picture suggested that he had a,significant element of congestive heart failure. With this, the patient was placed on increased doses of Lisinopril and Digoxin, with improvement of his respiratory status. On the day of discharge, the patient had minimal basilar rales; his chest also showed minimal expiratory wheezes; he had no edema; his heart rate was regular; his abdomen was soft; and his neck veins were not distended. It was, therefore, felt that the patient was stable for further management on an outpatient basis.
DIAGNOSTIC DATA:
The patient’s admission laboratory data was notable for his initial blood gas, which showed a pH of 7.02 with a pCO2 of 118 and a pO2 of 103. The patient’s electrocardiogram showed nonspecific ST-T wave changes. The patent’s CBC showed a white count of 24,000, with 56% neutrophils and 3% bands.
DISPOSITION:
The patient was discharged home.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
His diet was to be a 2 grams sodium, 1800 calorie ADA diet. His medications were to be Prednisone 20 mg twice per day, Theo-24 400 mg per day, Furosemide 40 mg 1-1/2 tabs p.o. per day; Acetazolamide 250 mg one p.o. per day, Lisinopril 20 mg. one p.o. twice per day, Digoxin 0.125 mg one p.o. q.d.
nitroglycerin paste 1 inch h.s.
K-Dur 60 mEq p.o. b.i.d. He was also to use a Ventolin inhaler every four hours as needed, and Azmacort four puffs twice per day. He was asked to return for follow-up with Dr. X in one to two weeks. Arrangements have been made for the patient to have an echocardiogram for further evaluation of his congestive heart failure later on the day of discharge.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm feeling better, thank you.
[doctor] that's good to hear. so, i reviewed your medical chart and it looks like you were admitted to the hospital with respiratory distress and had to be intubated due to end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, and hypertension. how are you managing your medications?
[patient] i'm taking prednisone, theo-24, furosemide, acetazolamide, lisinopril, digoxin, and nitroglycerin paste.
[doctor] great, it's important to take those as prescribed. how is your breathing? are you experiencing any wheezing or coughing?
[patient] i'm still a bit dyspneic and have some wheezing, but my breathing has improved since i was discharged from the hospital.

[doctor] alright, alright. i also see you had an echocardiogram scheduled to check out your congestive heart failure. did you get that done?
[patient] yep, got it done later the same day i was discharged.
[doctor] perfect. any questions or concerns about your meds or follow-up care?
[patient] no, i'm good. thanks.
[doctor] no problem. just remember to keep up with your meds and follow-up care. i'd like to see you back in one to two weeks to check on your progress.",3
"HISTORY:
The patient is scheduled for laparoscopic gastric bypass.  The patient has been earlier seen by Dr. X, her physician.  She has been referred to us from Family Practice.  In short, she is a 33-year-old lady with a BMI of 43, otherwise healthy with unsuccessful nonsurgical methods of weight loss.
She was on laparoscopic gastric bypass for weight loss.
She meets the National Institute of Health Criteria.  She is very well educated and motivated and has no major medical contraindications for the procedure.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
On physical examination today, she weighs 216 pounds with a BMI of 43.5, pulse is 96, temperature is 97.6, blood pressure is 122/80.  Lungs are clear.  Abdomen is soft, nontender.  There is stigmata for morbid obesity.  She has cesarean section scars in the lower abdomen with no herniation.
DISCUSSION:
I had a long talk with the patient about laparoscopic gastric bypass, possible open including risks, benefits, alternatives, need for long-term followup, need to adhere to dietary and exercise guidelines.  I also explained to her complications including rare cases of death secondary to DVT, PE, leak
peritonitis, sepsis, shock, multisystem organ failure, need for re-operation including for leak or bleeding, gastrostomy or jejunostomy for feeding, rare case of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, etc.
with myocardial infarction, pneumonia, atelectasis in the postoperative period were also discussed.
Short-term complications of gastric bypass including gastrojejunal stricture requiring endoscopic dilatation, marginal ulcer secondary to smoking or anti-inflammatory drug intake which can progress on to perforation or bleeding, small bowel obstruction secondary to internal hernia or adhesions, signs and symptoms of which were discussed.  The patient would alert us for earlier intervention.  Symptomatic gallstone formation secondary to rapid weight loss were also discussed.  How to avoid it by taking ursodiol were also discussed.  Long-term complications of gastric bypass including hair loss, excess skin, multivitamin and mineral deficiencies, protein-calorie malnutrition, weight regain, weight plateauing, need for major lifestyle and exercise and habit changes, avoiding pregnancy in the first two years, etc.
were all stressed.  The patient understands.  She wants to go to surgery.
In preparation of surgery, she will undergo very low-calorie diet through Medifast to decrease the size of the liver to make laparoscopic approach more successful and also to optimize her cardiopulmonary and metabolic comorbidities.  She will also see a psychologist, nutritionist, and exercise physiologist for a multidisciplinary effort for short and long-term success for weight loss surgery.  I will see her two weeks before the plan of surgery for further discussion and any other questions at that point of time.","[doctor] hi there, how are you doing today?

"TESTICULAR ULTRASOUND,REASON FOR EXAM:
Left testicular swelling for one day.
FINDINGS:
The left testicle is normal in size and attenuation, it measures 3.2 x 1.7 x 2.3 cm.  The right epididymis measures up to 9 mm.  There is a hydrocele on the right side.  Normal flow is seen within the testicle and epididymis on the right.
The left testicle is normal in size and attenuation, it measures 3.9 x 2.1 x 2.6 cm.  The left testicle shows normal blood flow.  The left epididymis measures up to 9 mm and shows a markedly increased vascular flow.  There is mild scrotal wall thickening.  A hydrocele is seen on the left side.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Hypervascularity of the left epididymis compatible with left epididymitis.
2.  Bilateral hydroceles.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, i am a little worried about the results of my testicular ultrasound.
[doctor] yes, i see here that you had some swelling on the left testicle. i have the results of the test and can go over them with you if you'd like.
[patient] yes, please.
[doctor] okay, so the ultrasound shows that the left testicle is normal in size and shape, but the left epididymis has increased blood flow which is consistent with epididymitis. 
[patient] okay. what is epididymitis?
[doctor] epididymitis is an inflammation of the epididymis, which is a tube that sits at the back of the testicle and stores sperm. it can cause pain, swelling and discomfort. it can be caused by a bacterial infection or a sexually transmitted infection.
[patient] oh, i see. is it serious?
[doctor] it can be, but we caught it early which is a good thing. i would like to prescribe you some antibiotics to help treat the infection. it is important to take them as directed until they are finished to make sure the infection clears up completely.
[patient] okay, i will make sure to take them as directed.
[doctor] great. the ultrasound also showed bilateral hydroceles, which is a collection of fluid around the testicles. this can sometimes be seen after an infection or injury. it is generally not serious but can cause some discomfort.
[patient] is there anything that needs to be done about it?
[doctor] since it is not causing any problems, we can monitor it for now. if it becomes larger or more uncomfortable, then we can discuss other options.
[patient] okay, thank you for explaining everything to me.
[doctor] no problem. i will go ahead and prescribe the antibiotics and we will schedule a follow-up appointment to make sure everything is back to normal. if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, do not hesitate to call the office.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?

"REASON FOR VISIT:
Elevated PSA with nocturia and occasional daytime frequency.
HISTORY:
A 68-year-old male with a history of frequency and some outlet obstructive issues along with irritative issues.  The patient has had history of an elevated PSA and PSA in 2004 was 5.5.  In 2003, he had undergone a biopsy by Dr. X, which was negative for adenocarcinoma of the prostate.  The patient has had PSAs as high as noted above.  His PSAs have been as low as 1.6, but those were on Proscar.  He otherwise appears to be doing reasonably well, off the Proscar, otherwise does have some irritative symptoms.  This has been ongoing for greater than five years.  No other associated symptoms or modifying factors.  Severity is moderate.  PSA relatively stable over time.
IMPRESSION:
Stable PSA over time, although he does have some irritative symptoms.  After our discussion, it does appear that if he is not drinking close to going to bed, he notes that his nocturia has significantly decreased.  At this juncture what I would like to do is to start with behavior modification.  There were no other associated symptoms or modifying factors.
PLAN:
The patient will discontinue all caffeinated and carbonated beverages and any fluids three hours prior to going to bed.  He already knows that this does decrease his nocturia.  He will do this without medications to see how well he does and hopefully he may need no other additional medications other than may be changing his alpha-blocker to something of more efficacious.","[doctor] hi, how are you doing today?
[patient] hi, i'm doing alright.
[doctor] so, you're here because of some urinary problems, is that right?

[doctor] i see. and have you noticed any other issues, like pain or discomfort while urinating?
[patient] no, nothing like that.
[doctor] okay. well, i see from your medical history that you have had some elevated psa levels in the past. when was the last time you had your psa levels checked?
[patient] i think it was about a year ago.
[doctor] and what were the results?
[patient] they were stable, but still a bit high.
[doctor] i see. well, based on your symptoms, it sounds like you might be dealing with some bladder irritation. we can try to address this with some behavior modification first, before considering any medications. how does that sound to you?
[patient] that sounds fine to me.
[doctor] great. so, what i would like you to do is to discontinue all caffeinated and carbonated beverages, and avoid drinking any fluids three hours before going to bed. this should help reduce your nighttime urination. you mentioned that you've already noticed some improvement when you do this, is that right?
[patient] yes, that's correct.
[doctor] okay, great. let's try this for a few weeks and see how you're doing. if you're still having problems, we can consider changing your alpha-blocker to something more effective. but hopefully, with these changes, we can avoid needing any additional medications.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Urinary retention.
2.  Benign prostate hypertrophy.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Urinary retention.
2.  Benign prostate hypertrophy.
PROCEDURES PERFORMED:
1.  Cystourethroscopy.
2.  Transurethral resection of prostate (TURP).
ANESTHESIA:
Spinal.
RESECTION TIME:
Less than one hour.
INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE:
This is a 62-year-old male with a history of urinary retention and progressive obstructive voiding symptoms and enlarged prostate 60 g on ultrasound, office cystoscopy confirmed this.
PROCEDURE:  PROCEDURE:
Informed written consent was obtained.  The patient was taken to the operative suite, administered spinal anesthetic and placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  She was sterilely prepped and draped in normal fashion.  A #27-French resectoscope was inserted utilizing the visual obturator blanching the bladder.  The bladder was visualized in all quadrants, no bladder tumors or stones were noted.  Ureteral orifices were visualized and did appear to be near the enlarged median lobe.  Prostate showed trilobar prostatic enlargement.  There were some cellules and tuberculations noted.  The visual obturator was removed.  The resectoscope was then inserted utilizing the #26 French resectoscope loop.  Resection was performed initiating at the bladder neck and at the median lobe.
This was taken down to the circular capsular fibers.  Attention was then turned to the left lateral lobe and this was resected from 12 o'clock to 3 o'clock down to the capsular fibers maintaining hemostasis along the way and taking care not to resect beyond the level of the verumontanum.  Ureteral orifices were kept out of harm's way throughout the case.  Resection was then performed from the 3 o'clock position to the 6 o'clock position in similar fashion.  Attention was then turned to the right lateral lobe and this was resected again in a similar fashion maintaining hemostasis along the way.  The resectoscope was then moved to the level of the proximal external sphincter and trimming of the apex was performed.  Open prostatic fossa was noted.  All chips were evacuated via Ellik evacuator and #24 French three-way Foley catheter was inserted and irrigated.  Clear return was noted.  The patient was then hooked up to better irrigation.  The patient was cleaned, reversed for anesthetic, and transferred to recovery room in stable condition.

"ADMITTING DIAGNOSES:
1. Hematuria.
2. Benign prostatic hyperplasia.
3. Osteoarthritis.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Hematuria, resolved.
2. Benign prostatic hyperplasia.
3. Complex renal cyst versus renal cell carcinoma or other tumor.
4. Osteoarthritis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
This is a 77-year-old African-American male who was previously well until he began having gross hematuria and clots passing through his urethra on the day of admission. He stated that he never had blood in his urine before, however, he does have a past history of BPH and he had a transurethral resection of prostate more than 10 years ago. He was admitted to a regular bed. Dr. G of Urology was consulted for evaluation of his hematuria. During the workup for this, he had a CT of the abdomen and pelvis with and without contrast with early and late-phase imaging for evaluation of the kidneys and collecting system. At that time, he was shown to have multiple bilateral renal cysts with one that did not meet classification as a simple cyst and ultrasound was recommended.
He had an ultrasound done of the cyst which showed a 2.1 x 2.7 cm mass arising from the right kidney which, again, did not fit ultrasound criteria for a simple cyst and they recommended further evaluation by an MRI as this could be a hemorrhagic cyst or a solid mass or tumor, so an MRI was scheduled on the day of discharge for further evaluation of this. The report was not back at discharge. The patient had a cystoscopy and transurethral resection of prostate as well with entire resection of the prostate gland. Pathology on this specimen showed multiple portions of prostatic tissue which was primarily fibromuscular, and he was diagnosed with nonprostatic hyperplasia. His urine slowly cleared. He tolerated a regular diet with no difficulties in his activities of daily living, and his Foley was removed on the day of discharge.
He was started on ciprofloxacin, Colace, and Lasix after the transurethral resection and continued these for a short course. He is asked to continue the Colace as an outpatient for stool softening for comfort.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Colace 100 mg 1 b.i.d.
DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP PLANNING:
The patient is to follow up with his primary care physician at ABCD, Dr. B or Dr. J, the patient is unsure of which, in the next couple weeks. He is to follow up with Dr. G of  Urology in the next week by phone in regards to the patient's MRI and plans for a laparoscopic partial renal resection biopsy. This is scheduled for the week after discharge potentially by Dr. G, and the patient will discuss the exact time later this week. The patient is to return to the emergency room or to our clinic if he has worsening hematuria again or no urine output.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Right distal femoral, subperiosteal abscess.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Right distal femoral, subperiosteal abscess.
OPERATION:
Repeat irrigation and debridement of above.
ANESTHESIA:
General.
BLOOD LOSS:
Minimal.
FLUID:
Per anesthesia.
DRAINS:
Hemovac times two.
COMPLICATIONS:
None apparent.
SPECIMENS:
To microbiology.
INDICATIONS:
She is a 10-year-old girl who has history of burns and has developed a subperiosteal abscess at her right distal femur.  I am bringing her back to the operating room for another exploration of this area and washout.  This will be the third procedure for this.  At the last time, there was gross purulence that was encountered.  Since that time, the patient has defervesced.  Her white count is slowly coming down.  Her C-reactive protein is slowly coming down.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After informed consent was obtained, operative site marked, and after preoperative antibiotics were given, the patient was brought back to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table, where Anesthesia induced general anesthesia.  The patient's right lower extremity was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  Surgical timeout occurred verifying the patient's identification, surgical site, surgical procedure, and administration of antibiotics.  The patient's previous incision sites had the sutures removed.  We bluntly dissected down through to the IT band.  These deep stitches were then removed.  We exposed the area of the subperiosteal abscess.  The tissue looked much better than at the last surgery.  We irrigated this area with three liters of saline containing bacitracin.  Next, we made our small medial window to assist with washout of the joint itself.  We put another three liters of saline containing bacitracin through the knee joint.  Lastly, we did another three liters into the area of the distal femur with three liters of plain saline.  We then placed two Hemovac drains, one in the metaphysis and one superficially.  We closed the deep fascia with #1 PDS.  Subcutaneous layers with 2-0 Monocryl and closed the skin with 2-0 nylon.  We placed a sterile dressing.  We then turned the case over to Dr. Petty for dressing change and skin graft.
PLAN:
Our plan will be to pull the drains in 48 hours.  We will then continue to watch the patient's fever curve and follow her white count to see how she is responding to the operative and medical therapies.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Right trigger thumb.
SURGERY:
Release of A1 pulley, CPT code 26055.
ANESTHESIA:
General LMA.
TOURNIQUET TIME:
9 minutes at 200 torr.
FINDINGS:
The patient was found to have limitations to extension at the IP joint to the right thumb.  He was found to have full extension after release of A1 pulley.
INDICATIONS:
The patient is 2-1/2-year-old.  He has a history of a trigger thumb.  This was evaluated in the office.  He was indicated for release of A1 pulley to allow for full excursion.  Risks and benefits including recurrence, infection, and problems with anesthesia were discussed at length with the family.  They wanted to proceed.
PROCEDURE:
The patient was brought into the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position.  General anesthesia was induced without incident.  He was given a weight-adjusted dose of antibiotics.  The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in a standard fashion.  Limb was exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  Tourniquet was raised to 200 torr.  Transverse incision was then made at the base of thumb.  The underlying soft tissues were carefully spread in line longitudinally.  The underlying tendon was then identified.  The accompanied A1 pulley was also identified.  This was incised longitudinally using #11 blade.  Inspection of the entire tendon then demonstrated good motion both in flexion and extension.  The leaflets of the pulley were easily identified.
The wound was then irrigated and closed.  The skin was closed using interrupted #4-0 Monocryl simple sutures.  The area was injected with 5 mL of 0.25% Marcaine.  The wound was dressed with Xeroform, dry sterile dressings, hand dressing, Kerlix, and Coban.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia and taken to the recovery room in good condition.  There were no complications.  All instrument, sponge, needle counts were correct at the end of case.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Right both bone forearm refracture.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Right both bone forearm refracture.
PROCEDURE:
Closed reduction and pinning of the right ulna with placement of a long-arm cast.
ANESTHESIA:
Surgery performed under general anesthesia.  Local anesthetic was 10 mL of 0.25% Marcaine plain.
COMPLICATIONS:
No intraoperative complications.
DRAINS:
None.
SPECIMENS:
None.
HARDWARE:
Hardware was 0.79 K-wire.
HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:
The patient is a 5-year-old male who sustained refracture of his right forearm on 12/05/2007.  The patient was seen in the emergency room.  The patient had a complete fracture of both bones with shortening bayonet apposition.  Treatment options were offered to the family including casting versus closed reduction and pinning.  The parents opted for the latter.  Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed.  Risks of surgery included risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, and need for later hardware removal, cast tightness.  All questions were answered, and the parents agreed to the above plan.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.  A small incision was made at the tip of the olecranon.  Initially, a 1.11 guidewire was placed, but this was noted to be too wide for this canal.  This was changed for a 0.79 K-wire.  This was driven up to the fracture site.  The fracture was manually reduced and then the K-wire passed through the distal segment.  This demonstrated adequate fixation and reduction of both bones.  The pin was then cut short.  The fracture site and pin site was infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine.  The incision was closed using 4-0 Monocryl.  The wounds were cleaned and dried.  Dressed with Xeroform, 4 x 4.  The patient was then placed in a well-moulded long-arm cast.  He tolerated the procedure well.  He was subsequently taken to Recovery in stable condition.
POSTOPERATIVE PLAN:
The patient will be maintain current pin, and long-arm cast for 4 weeks at which time he will return for cast removal.  X-rays of the right forearm will be taken.  The patient may need additional mobilization time.  Once the fracture has healed, we will take the pin out, usually at the earliest 3 to 4 months.  Intraoperative findings were relayed to the parents.  All questions were answered.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?
[patient] hi, i'm okay.
[doctor] i wanted to talk to you about your procedure. you had a closed reduction and pinning of your right ulna with placement of a long-arm cast. everything went according to plan, and there were no complications during the procedure. you were under general anesthesia and we also used a local anesthetic called marcaine.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] we used a small incision made at the tip of the olecranon, and inserted a 0.79 k-wire into the canal. this wire was driven up to the fracture site and passed through the distal segment, which allowed adequate fixation and reduction of both bones. we then closed the incision with stitches and dressed it with xeroform and 4 x 4. you tolerated the procedure well and were recovering in stable condition.
[patient] that's good to hear.
[doctor] you will need to maintain your current pin and long-arm cast for 4 weeks. after that, we will take x-rays and see if you need additional time in the cast. once the fracture has fully healed, we will remove the pin, usually at around 3 to 4 months. does that make sense to you?

Surgery performed under general anesthesia.
COMPLICATIONS:
There were no intraoperative complications.
DRAINS:
None.
SPECIMENS:
None.
LOCAL:
10 mL of 0.50% Marcaine local anesthetic.
HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:
The patient is a 13-year-old girl who presented in November with an acute on chronic right slipped capital femoral epiphysis.  She underwent in situ pinning.  The patient on followup; however, noted to have intraarticular protrusion of her screw.  This was not noted intraoperatively on previous fluoroscopic views.  Given this finding, I explained to the father and especially the mother that this can cause further joint damage and that the screw would need to be exchanged for a shorter one.  Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed.  Risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, failure to remove the screw, possible continued joint stiffness or damage.  All questions were answered and parents agreed to above plan.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  A small bump was placed underneath her right buttock.  The right upper thigh was then prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.  The upper aspect of the incision was reincised.  The dissection was carried down to the crew, which was easily found.  A guidewire was placed inside the screw with subsequent removal of the previous screw.  The previous screw measured 65 mm.  A 60 mm screw was then placed under direct visualization with fluoroscopy.  The hip was taken through full range of motion to check on the length of the screw, which demonstrated no intraarticular protrusion.  The guidewire was removed.  The wound was then irrigated and closed using 2-0 Vicryl in the fascial layer as well as the subcutaneous fat.  The skin was closed with 4-0 Monocryl.  The wound was cleaned and dried, dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, 4 x 4s, and tape.  The area was infiltrated with total 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine local anesthetic.

Phacoemulsification of cataract, extraocular lens implant in left eye.

LENS IMPLANT USED:
Alcon, model SN60WF, power of 22.5 diopters.

PHACOEMULSIFICATION TIME:
1 minute 41 seconds at 44.4% power.

INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:
This patient has a visually significant cataract in the affected eye with the best corrected visual acuity under moderate glare conditions worse than 20/40.  The patient complains of difficulties with glare in performing activities of daily living.
INFORMED CONSENT:
The risks, benefits and alternatives of the procedure were discussed with the patient in the office prior to scheduling surgery.  All questions from the patient were answered after the surgical procedure was explained in detail.  The risks of the procedure as explained to the patient include, but are not limited to, pain, infection, bleeding, loss of vision, retinal detachment, need for further surgery, loss of lens nucleus, double vision, etc.  Alternative of the procedure is to do nothing or seek a second opinion.  Informed consent for this procedure was obtained from the patient.
OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE:
The patient was brought to the holding area.  Previously, an intravenous infusion was begun at a keep vein open rate.  After adequate sedation by the anesthesia department (under monitored anesthesia care conditions), a peribulbar and retrobulbar block was given around the operative eye.  A total of 10 mL mixture with a 70/30 mixture of 2% Xylocaine without epinephrine and 0.75% bupivacaine without epinephrine.  An adequate amount of anesthetic was infused around the eye without giving excessive tension to the eye or excessive chemosis to the periorbital area.  Manual pressure and a Honan balloon were placed over the eye for approximately 2 minutes after injection and adequate akinesia and anesthesia was noted.  Vital sign monitors were detached from the patient.  The patient was moved to the operative suite and the same monitors were reattached.  The periocular area was cleansed, dried, prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner for ocular surgery.  The speculum was set into place and the operative microscope was brought over the eye.  The eye was examined.  Adequate mydriasis was observed and a visually significant cataract was noted on the visual axis.
A temporal clear corneal incision was begun using a crescent blade with an initial groove incision made partial thickness through the temporal clear cornea.  Then a pocket incision was created without entering the anterior chamber of the eye.  Two peripheral paracentesis ports were created on each side of the initial incision site.  Viscoelastic was used to deepen the anterior chamber of the eye.  A 2.65 mm keratome was then used to complete the corneal valve incision.  A cystitome was bent and created using a tuberculin syringe needle.  It was placed in the anterior chamber of the eye.  A continuous curvilinear capsulorrhexis was begun.  It was completed using O'Gawa Utrata forceps.  A balanced salt solution on the irrigating cannula was placed through the paracentesis port of the eye to affect hydrodissection and hydrodelineation of the lens nucleus.  The lens nucleus was noted to be freely mobile in the bag.
The phacoemulsification tip was placed into the anterior chamber of the eye.  The lens nucleus was phacoemulsified and aspirated in a divide-and-conquer technique.  All remaining cortical elements were removed from the eye using irrigation and aspiration using a bimanual technique through the paracentesis ports.  The posterior capsule remained intact throughout the entire procedure.  Provisc was used to deepen the anterior chamber of the eye.  A crescent blade was used to expand the internal aspect of the wound.  The lens was taken from its container and inspected.  No defects were found.  The lens power selected was compared with the surgery worksheet from Dr. X's office.  The lens was placed in an inserter under Provisc.  It was placed through the wound, into the capsular bag and extruded gently from the inserter.  It was noted to be adequately centered in the capsular bag using a Sinskey hook.  The remaining viscoelastic was removed from the eye with irrigation an aspiration through the paracentesis side ports using a bimanual technique.  The eye was noted to be inflated without overinflation.  The wounds were tested for leaks, none were found.  Five drops dilute Betadine solution was placed over the eye.  The eye was irrigated.  The speculum was removed.  The drapes were removed.  The periocular area was cleaned and dried.  Maxitrol ophthalmic ointment was placed into the interpalpebral space.  A semi-pressure patch and shield was placed over the eye.  The patient was taken to the floor in stable and satisfactory condition, was given detailed written instructions and asked to follow up with Dr. X tomorrow morning in the office.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after your cataract surgery?

DISCUSSION:
After informed consent was obtained at the request of Dr. Xyz, Permacath placement was performed.
The right neck and anterior chest were sterilely cleansed and draped.  Lidocaine 1% buffered with sodium bicarbonate was used as a local anesthetic.  Using ultrasound guidance, a micropuncture needle was advanced into the internal jugular vein.  The wire was then advanced with fluoroscopic guidance.  A dilator was placed.  An incision was then made at the puncture site for approximately 1 cm in the neck.  A 1 cm incision was also made in the anterior chest.  The catheter was tunneled subcutaneously from the incision on the anterior chest, out the incision of the neck.  Following this, over the wire, the tract into the internal jugular vein was dilated and a peel-away sheath was placed.  The catheter was then advanced through the peel-away sheath.  The peel-away sheath was removed.  The catheter was examined under fluoroscopic imaging and was in satisfactory position.  Both ports were aspirated and flushed easily.  Following this, the incision on the neck was closed with 2 #3-0 silk sutures.  The incision on the anterior chest was also closed 2 #3-0 silk sutures.

3.  Insertion of ventricular lead through left subclavian approach and ventricular lead is Boston Scientific Dextrose model 12345, serial number 123456.
4.  Insertion of single-chamber pacemaker implantation, Altrua, serial number 123456.
5.  Closure of the pocket after formation of pocket for pacemaker.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
The procedure was explained to the patient with risks and benefits.  The patient agreed and signed the consent form.  The patient was brought to the cath lab, draped and prepped in the usual sterile fashion, received 1.5 mg of versed and 25 mg of Benadryl for conscious sedation.
Access to the right subclavian was successful after the second attempt.  The first attempt accessed the left subclavian artery.  The needle was removed and manual compression applied for five minutes followed by re-accessing the subclavian vein successfully.  The J-wire was introduced into the left subclavian vein.
The anterior wall chest was anesthetized with lidocaine 2%, 2-inch incision using a #10 blade was used.
The pocket was formed using blunt dissection as he was using the Bovie cautery for hemostasis.  The patient went asystole during the procedure.  The transcutaneous pacer was used.  The patient was oxygenating well.  The patient had several compression applied by the nurse.  However, her own rhythm resolved spontaneously and the percutaneous pacer was kept on standby.
After that, the J-wire was tunneled into the pocket and then used to put the #7-French sheath into the left subclavian vein.  The lead from the Boston Scientific Dextrose model 12345, serial number 12345 was inserted through the left subclavian to the right atrium; however, it was difficult to really enter the right ventricle; and while the lead was in place, the side port of the sheath was used to inject 15 mL of contrast to assess the subclavian and the right atrium.  The findings were showing different anatomy, may be consistent with persistent left superior vena cava, and the angle to the right ventricle was different.  At that point, the lead stylet was reshaped and was able to cross the tricuspid valve in a position consistent with the mid septal place.
At that point, the lead was actively fixated.  The stylet was removed.  The R-wave measured at 40 millivolts.  The impedance was 580 and the threshold was 1.3 volt.  The numbers were accepted and because of the patient's fragility and the different anatomy noticed in the right atrium, concern about putting a second lead with re-access of the subclavian was high.  I decided to proceed with a single-chamber pacemaker as a backup system.
After that, the lead sleeve was used to actively fixate the lead in the anterior chest with two Ethibond sutures in the usual fashion.
The lead was attached to the pacemaker in the header.  The pacemaker was single-chamber pacemaker Altura 60, serial number 123456.  After that, the pacemaker was put in the pocket.  Pocket was irrigated with normal saline and was closed into two layers, deep interrupted #3-0 Vicryl and surface as continuous #4-0 Vicryl continuous.
The pacemaker was programmed as VVI 60, and with history is 10 to 50 beats per minute.  The lead position will be evaluated with chest x-ray.
No significant bleeding noticed.
CONCLUSION:
Successful single-chamber pacemaker implantation with left subclavian approach and venogram to assess the subclavian access site and the right atrial or right ventricle with asystole that resolved spontaneously during the procedure.  No significant bleed.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after your pacemaker implantation?

TIME OUT:
Time out was performed before the procedure started.
INDICATIONS:
The patient was a 42-year-old female who fell and sustained a displaced left metaphyseal distal radius fracture indicated for osteosynthesis.  The patient was in early stage of gestation.  Benefits and risks including radiation exposure were discussed with the patient and consulted her primary care doctor.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
Supine position, LMA anesthesia, well-padded arm, tourniquet, Hibiclens, alcohol prep, and sterile drape.
Exsanguination achieved, tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg.  First, under fluoroscopy the fracture was reduced.  A 0.045 K-wire was inserted from dorsal ulnar corner of the distal radius and crossing fracture line to maintain the reduction.  A 2-cm radial incision, superficial radial nerve was exposed and protected.  Dissecting between the first and second dorsal extensor retinaculum, the second dorsal extensor compartment was elevated off from the distal radius.  The guidewire was inserted under fluoroscopy.  A cannulated drill was used to drill antral hole.  Antral awl was inserted.  Then we reamed the canal to size 2.  Size 2 Micronail was inserted to the medullary canal.  Using distal locking guide, three locking screws were inserted distally.  The second dorsal incision was made.  The deep radial dorsal surface was exposed.  Using locking guide, two proximal shaft screws were inserted and locked the nail to the radius.  Fluoroscopic imaging was taken and showing restoration of the height, tilt, and inclination of the radius.  At this point, tourniquet was deflated, hemostasis achieved, wounds irrigated and closed in layers.  Sterile dressing applied.  The patient then was extubated and transferred to the recovery room under stable condition.
Postoperatively, the patient will see a therapist within five days.  We will immobilize wrist for two weeks and then starting flexion-extension and prosupination exercises.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after the surgery?

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
Left elbow fracture dislocation with incarceration of the medial epicondyle with ulnar nerve paresthesias status post closed reduction, attempts 2, right radial shaft fracture with volar apex angulation.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
Left elbow fracture dislocation with incarceration of the medial epicondyle with ulnar nerve paresthesias status post closed reduction, attempts 2, right radial shaft fracture with volar apex angulation.
PROCEDURES:
1.  Open reduction internal fixation of the left medial epicondyle fracture with placement in a long-arm posterior well-molded splint.
2.  Closed reduction casting of the right forearm.
ANESTHESIA:
Surgery performed under general anesthesia.  Local anesthetic was 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine.
TOURNIQUET TIME:
On the left was 29 minutes.
COMPLICATIONS:
There were no intraoperative complications.
DRAINS:
None.
SPECIMENS:
None.
HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:
The patient is a 13-year-old right-hand dominant girl, who fell off a swing at school around 1:30 today.  The patient was initially seen at an outside facility and brought here by her father, given findings on x-ray, a closed reduction was attempted on the left elbow.  After the attempted reduction, the patient was noted to have an incarcerated medial epicondyle fracture as well as increasing ulnar paresthesias that were not present prior to the procedure.  Given this finding, the patient needed urgent open reduction and internal fixation to relieve the pressure on the ulnar nerve.  At that same time, the patient's mildly angulated radial shaft fracture will be reduced.  This was explained to the father.  The risks of surgery included the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, and possible continuous nerve symptoms.  All questions were answered.  The father agreed to the above plan.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  The left upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  Attempts to remove the incarcerated medial epicondyle with supination, valgus stress, and with extension were unsuccessful.  It was decided at this time that she would need open reduction.  The arm was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of the tourniquet to 250 mmHg.  The Esmarch was then removed.  An incision was then made.  Care was taken to avoid any injury to the ulnar nerve.  The medial epicondyle fracture was found incarcerated into the anterior aspect of the joint.  This was easily removed.  The ulnar nerve was also identified, and appeared to be intact.  The medial epicondyle was then transfixed using a guidewire into its anatomic position with the outer cortex over drilled with a 3.2 drill bit, and subsequently a 44-mm 4.5 partially threaded cannulated screw was then placed with a washer to hold the medial epicondyle in place.  After fixation of the fragment, the ulnar nerve was visualized as it traveled around the medial epicondyle fracture with no signs of impingement.  The wound was then irrigated with normal saline and closed using 2-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Monocryl.  The wound was clean and dry, dressed with Steri-Strips and Xeroform.  The area was infiltrated with 0.5% Marcaine.  The patient was then placed in a long-arm posterior well-molded splint with 90 degrees of flexion and neutral rotation.  The tourniquet was released at 30 minutes prior to placement of the dressing, showed no significant bleeding.  Attention was then turned to right side, the arm was then manipulated and a well-molded long-arm cast placed.  The final position in the cast revealed a very small residual volar apex angulation, which is quite acceptable in this age.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, was subsequently extubated and taken to recovery in a stable condition.
POSTOPERATIVE PLAN:
The patient will be hospitalized for pain control and neurovascular testing for the next 1 to 2 days.  The father was made aware of the intraoperative findings.  All questions answered.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after the surgery?
[patient] i'm feeling alright, a bit sore.
[doctor] that's understandable. your surgery went well, and the left elbow fracture has been fixed with a long-arm posterior well-molded splint. the right forearm fracture has also been casted. you will be hospitalized for the next 1 to 2 days for pain management and neurovascular testing. 
[patient] okay, thank you. what were the intraoperative findings?
[doctor] we found that the medial epicondyle fracture had become incarcerated in the anterior aspect of the joint, and the ulnar nerve had been affected. we performed an open reduction internal fixation of the left medial epicondyle fracture, and we were able to repair it with a cannulated screw. we also addressed the radial shaft fracture. 
[patient] will i experience any continuous nerve symptoms?
[doctor] it is possible, but we will monitor your neurovascular status closely during your hospital stay. it's important that you report any changes in sensation or motion of the extremity. overall, the surgery went smoothly, and we will make sure to manage your pain and monitor your progress.","[doctor] hey there, how are you feeling after the surgery?

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Volar laceration to right ring finger with possible digital nerve injury with possible flexor tendon injury.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Laceration to right ring finger with partial laceration to the ulnar slip of the FDS which is the flexor digitorum superficialis.
2.  25% laceration to the flexor digitorum profundus of the right ring finger and laceration 100% of the ulnar digital nerve to the right ring finger.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
1.  Repair of nerve and tendon, right ring finger.
2.  Exploration of digital laceration.
ANESTHESIA:
General.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
Less than 10 cc.
TOTAL TOURNIQUET TIME:
57 minutes.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
DISPOSITION:
To PACU in stable condition.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 13-year-old male who had sustained a laceration from glass and had described numbness and tingling in his right ring finger.
GROSS OPERATIVE FINDINGS:
After wound exploration, it was found there was a 100% laceration to the ulnar digital neurovascular bundle.  The FDS had a partial ulnar slip laceration and the FDP had a 25% transverse laceration as well.  The radial neurovascular bundle was found to be completely intact.
OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:
The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  All bony prominences were adequately padded.  Tourniquet was placed on the right upper extremity after being packed with Webril, but not inflated at this time.  The right upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The hand was inspected.  Palmar surface revealed approximally 0.5 cm laceration at the base of the right ring finger at the base of proximal phalanx, which was approximated with nylon suture.  The sutures were removed and the wound was explored.  It was found that the ulnar digital neurovascular bundle was 100% transected.  The radial neurovascular bundle on the right ring finger was found to be completely intact.  We explored the flexor tendon and found that there was a partial laceration of the ulnar slip of the FDS and a 25% laceration in a transverse fashion to the FDP.  We copiously irrigated the wound.  Repair was undertaken of the FDS with #3-0 undyed Ethibond suture.  The laceration of the FDP was not felt that it need to repair due to majority of the substance in the FDP was still intact.  Attention during our repair at the flexor tendon, the A1 pulley was incised for better visualization as well as better tendon excursion after repair.  Attention was then drawn to the ulnar digital bundle which has been transected prior during the injury.  The digital nerve was dissected proximally and distally to likely visualize the nerve.  The nerve was then approximated using microvascular technique with #8-0 nylon suture.  The hands were well approximated.  The nerve was not under undue tension.  The wound was then copiously irrigated and the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon interrupted horizontal mattress alternating with simple suture.  Sterile dressing was placed and a dorsal extension Box splint was placed.  The patient was transferred off of the bed and placed back on a gurney and taken to PACU in stable condition.  Overall prognosis is good.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?
[patient] i'm feeling okay, a bit groggy from the anesthesia.
[doctor] that's normal. i wanted to talk to you about your surgery. you had a laceration to your right ring finger, and we found that the ulnar digital neurovascular bundle was completely cut. we also found a partial laceration of the ulnar slip of the fds and a 25% laceration of the fdp.
[patient] okay, what does that mean?
[doctor] we repaired the fds and left the fdp alone since the majority of the substance was still intact. we also repaired the ulnar digital nerve with microvascular technique. the surgery went well and we placed a dorsal extension box splint on your hand. you'll need to come back for a follow-up appointment to make sure everything is healing well.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
Prior to each surgical stage, the surgical site was tested for anesthesia and reanesthetized as needed, after which it was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.
The clinically-apparent tumor was carefully defined and debulked prior to the first stage, determining the extent of the surgical excision.  With each stage, a thin layer of tumor-laden tissue was excised with a narrow margin of normal appearing skin, using the Mohs fresh tissue technique.  A map was prepared to correspond to the area of skin from which it was excised.  The tissue was prepared for the cryostat and sectioned.  Each section was coded, cut and stained for microscopic examination.  The entire base and margins of the excised piece of tissue were examined by the surgeon.  Areas noted to be positive on the previous stage (if applicable) were removed with the Mohs technique and processed for analysis.

[doctor] oh yeah, that's right. during the surgery, the clinically-apparent tumor was carefully defined and debulked before the first stage to determine the extent of the surgical excision. each stage involved excising a thin layer of tissue with a narrow margin of normal appearing skin using the mohs fresh tissue technique. we prepared a map to correspond to the area of skin from which the tissue was excised, and each section was coded, cut, and stained for microscopic examination. after examining the base and margins of the tissue, any areas noted to be positive on the previous stage were removed with the mohs technique and analyzed.
[patient] okay, gotcha.
[doctor] in the end, no tumor was found after the final stage of microscopically controlled surgery. and after discussing the various options for closure with you, we selected the best option for each defect to ensure optimal functional and cosmetic results. if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.
[patient] thank you, doctor. everything has been explained clearly.",2
"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 22-year-old male who sustained a mandible fracture and was seen in the emergency department at Hospital.  He was seen in my office today and scheduled for surgery today for closed reduction of the mandible fractures.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
Left angle and right body mandible fractures.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
Left angle and right body mandible fractures.
PROCEDURE:
Closed reduction of mandible fractures with Erich arch bars and elastic fixation.
ANESTHESIA:
General nasotracheal.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
CONDITION:
Stable to PACU.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the table in a supine position and after demonstration of an adequate plane of general anesthesia via the nasotracheal route, the patient was prepped and draped in the usual fashion for placement of arch bars.  Gauze throat pack was placed and upper and lower arch bars were placed on the maxillary and mandibular dentition with a 25-gauge circumdental wires.  After the placement of the arch bars, the occlusion was checked and found to be satisfactory and stable.  The throat pack was then removed.  An NG tube was then passed and approximately 50 cc of stomach contents were suctioned out.
The elastic fixation was then placed on the arch bars holding the patient in maxillomandibular fixation and at this point, the procedure was terminated and the patient was then awakened, extubated, and taken to the PACU in stable condition.","[doctor]: hi there, how are you feeling after your surgery?
[patient]: hi, i'm feeling a little sore but overall okay.
[doctor]: that's expected after surgery. i just wanted to check in with you and see how you're doing. you had a mandible fracture and we did a closed reduction with erich arch bars and elastic fixation. everything went well during the procedure and there were no complications.
[patient]: okay, that's good to hear.
[doctor]: during the procedure, we placed the upper and lower arch bars on your maxillary and mandibular dentition and checked your occlusion to make sure it was stable. afterward, we placed elastic fixation on the arch bars to hold you in maxillomandibular fixation. you were then awakened and taken to the pacu in stable condition.

"TITLE OF PROCEDURE:
Percutaneous liver biopsy.
ANALGESIA:
2% Lidocaine.
ALLERGIES:
The patient denied any allergy to iodine, lidocaine or codeine.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
The procedure was described in detail to the patient at a previous clinic visit and by the medical staff today.  The patient was told of complications which might occur consisting of bleeding, bile peritonitis, bowel perforation, pneumothorax, or death.  The risks and benefits of the procedure were understood, and the patient signed the consent form freely.
With the patient lying in the supine position and the right hand underneath the head, an area of maximal dullness was identified in the mid-axillary location by percussion.  The area was prepped and cleaned with povidone iodine following which the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and serosal surfaces were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine down to the capsule of the liver.  Next, a small incision was made with a Bard-Parker #11 scalpel.  A 16-gauge modified Klatskin needle was inserted through the incision and into the liver on one occasion with the patient in deep expiration.  Liver cores measuring *** cm were obtained and will be sent to Pathology for routine histologic study.
POST-PROCEDURE COURSE AND DISPOSITION:
The patient will remain under close observation in the medical treatment room for four to six hours and then be discharged home without medication.  Normal activities can be resumed tomorrow.  The patient is to contact me if severe abdominal or chest pain, fever, melena, light-headedness or any unusual symptoms develop.  An appointment will be made for the patient to see me in the clinic in the next few weeks to discuss the results of the liver biopsy so that management decisions can be made.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Prior to discharge, hepatitis A and B vaccines will be recommended.  Risks and benefits for vaccination have been addressed and the patient will consider this option.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling?

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Left patellar chondromalacia.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Left patellar chondromalacia with tight lateral structures.
PROCEDURE:
Left knee arthroscopy with lateral capsular release.
ANESTHESIA:
Surgery performed under general anesthesia.
TOURNIQUET TIME:
47 minutes.
MEDICATION:
The patient received 0.5% Marcaine local anesthetic 32 mL.
COMPLICATIONS:
No intraoperative complications.
DRAINS AND SPECIMENS:
None.
HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:
The patient is a 14-year-old girl who started having left knee pain in the fall of 2007.  She was not seen in Orthopedic Clinic until November 2007.  The patient had an outside MRI performed that demonstrated left patellar chondromalacia only.  The patient was referred to physical therapy for patellar tracking exercises.  She was also given a brace.  The patient reported increasing pain with physical therapy and mother strongly desired other treatment.  It was explained to the mother in detail that this is a difficult problem to treat although majority of the patients get better with physical therapy.  Her failure with nonoperative treatment is below the standard 6-month trial; however, given her symptoms and severe pain, lateral capsular release was offered.  Risk and benefits of surgery were discussed.  Risks of surgery including risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion extremity, failure of procedure to relieve pain, need for postoperative rehab, and significant postoperative swelling.  All questions were answered, and mother and daughter agreed to the above plans.
PROCEDURE NOTE:
The patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the upper aspect of left thigh.  The extremity was then prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  A medial suprapatellar portal was marked on the skin as well as anteromedial and anterolateral joint line.  The extremity was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of tourniquet to 250 mmHg.  Esmarch was then removed.  Incisions were then made.  Camera was initially inserted into the lateral joint line.  Visualization of patellofemoral joint revealed type 2 chondromalacia with slight lateral subluxation.  The patient did have congruent articulation about 30 degrees of knee flexion.  Visualization of the medial joint line revealed no loose bodies.  There was a small plica.  Visualization of the medial joint line revealed no significant chondromalacia.  Menisci was probed and tested with no signs of tears and instability.  ACL was noted to be intact.  The intercondylar notch and lateral joint line also revealed no significant chondromalacia or meniscal pathology.  Lateral gutter also demonstrated no loose bodies or plica.  The camera was then removed and inserted into the anteromedial portal using two 18-gauge needles.  The extent of lateral capsular release was marked using a monopolar coblator, lateral capsular release was performed.  The patient had significant improvement in anteromedial translation from 25% to 50%.  At the end of the case, all instruments were removed.  The knee was injected with 32 mL of 0.5% Marcaine with additional epinephrine.  Please note, the patient received 30 mL of 1:500,000 dilution epinephrine at the beginning of the case.  The portals were then closed using 4-0 Monocryl.  The wound was clean and dry, and dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, and 4 x 4s.  The kneecap was translated medially under pressure and a bias placed.  The tourniquet was released at 47 minutes.  The patient was then placed in the knee immobilizer.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery in stable condition.
POSTOPERATIVE PLAN:
The patient will weightbear as tolerated in the knee immobilizer.  She will start physical therapy within 1 to 2 weeks to work on patella mobilization as well as reconditioning and strengthening.  Intraoperative findings were relayed to the mother.  All questions were answered.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after your left knee arthroscopy?
[patient] hi, doctor. i am feeling okay, just a little sore.
[doctor] that's normal. i just wanted to go over the results of your surgery with you. we found that you had left patellar chondromalacia with tight lateral structures, which was causing your pain.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] during the surgery, we performed a left knee arthroscopy with lateral capsular release. we marked the extent of the release using a monopolar coblator and then performed the release, which improved your anteromedial translation from 25% to 50%. we also injected your knee with 32 ml of 0.5% marcaine with additional epinephrine to help with the pain.

PREOP DIAGNOSIS:
Postoperative wound infection, complicated (ICD-9 code 998.59).
POSTOP DIAGNOSIS:
Postoperative wound infection, complicated (ICD-9 code 998.59).
PROCEDURE DETAIL:
The patient is a 59-year-old gentleman who is status post open reduction and internal fixation of bilateral calcanei.  He was admitted for a left wound breakdown with drainage.  He underwent an irrigation and debridement with VAC placement 72 hours prior to this operative visit.  It was decided to bring him back for a repeat irrigation and debridement and VAC change prior to Plastics doing a local flap.  The risks of surgery were discussed in detail including, but not limited to infection, bleeding, injuries to nerves and vital structures, need for reoperation, pain or stiffness, arthritis, fracture, the risk of anesthesia.  The patient understood these risks and wished to proceed.  The patient was admitted, and the operative site was marked.
The patient was brought to the operating room and given general anesthetic.  He was placed in the right lateral decubitus, and all bony prominences were well padded.  An axillary roll was placed.  A well-padded thigh tourniquet was placed on the left leg.  The patient then received antibiotics on the floor prior to coming down to the operating room which satisfied the preoperative requirement.  Left leg was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  The previous five antibiotic spacer beads were removed without difficulty.  The wound was then rongeured and curetted, and all bone was cleaned down to healthy bleeding bone.  The wound actually looked quite good with evidence of purulence or drainage.  Skin edges appeared to be viable.  Hardware all looked to be intact.  At this point, the wound was irrigated with 9 liters of bibiotic solution.  A VAC sponge was then placed over the wound, and the patient's leg was placed into a posterior splint.  The patient was awakened and then taken to recovery in good condition.
Dr. X was present for the timeouts and for all critical portions of the procedure.  He was immediately available for any questions during the case.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES,1.  Dyspnea on exertion with abnormal stress echocardiography.
2.  Frequent PVCs.
3.  Metabolic syndrome.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES,1.  A 50% distal left main and two-vessel coronary artery disease with normal left ventricular systolic function.
2.  Frequent PVCs.
3.  Metabolic syndrome.
PROCEDURES,1.  Left heart catheterization with left ventriculography.
2.  Selective coronary angiography.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory in fasting state.  Both groins were prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Xylocaine 1% was used as local anesthetic.  Versed and fentanyl were used for conscious sedation.  Next, a #6-French sheath was placed in the right femoral artery using modified Seldinger technique.  Next, selective angiography of the left coronary artery was performed in multiple views using #6-French JL4 catheter.  Next, selective angiography of the right coronary artery was performed in multiple views using #6-French 3DRC catheter.  Next, a #6-French angle pigtail catheter was advanced into the left ventricle.  The left ventricular pressure was then recorded.  Left ventriculography was the performed using 36 mL of contrast injected over 3 seconds.  The left heart pull back was then performed.  The catheter was then removed.
Angiography of the right femoral artery was performed.  Hemostasis was obtained by Angio-Seal closure device.  The patient left the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory in stable condition.
HEMODYNAMICS,1.  LV pressure was 163/0 with end-diastolic pressure of 17.  There was no significant gradient across the aortic valve.
2.  Left ventriculography showed old inferior wall hypokinesis.  Global left ventricular systolic function is normal.  Estimated ejection fraction was 58%.  There is no significant mitral regurgitation.
3.  Significant coronary artery disease.
4.  The left main is approximately 7 or 8 mm proximally.  It trifurcates into left anterior descending artery, ramus intermedius artery, and left circumflex artery.  The distal portion of the left main has an ulcerated excentric plaque, up to about 50% in severity.
5.  The left anterior descending artery is around 4 mm proximally.  It extends slightly beyond the apex into the inferior wall.  It gives rises to several medium size diagonal branches as well as small to medium size multiple septal perforators.  At the ostium of the left anterior descending artery, there was an eccentric plaque up to 70% to 80%, best seen in the shallow LAO with caudal angulation.
There was no other flow-limiting disease noted in the rest of the left anterior descending artery or its major branches.
The ramus intermedius artery is around 3 mm proximally, but shortly after its origin, it bifurcates into two medium size branches.  There was no significant disease noted in the ramus intermedius artery however.
The left circumflex artery is around 2.5 mm proximally.  It gave off a recurrent atrial branch and a small AV groove branch prior to terminating into a bifurcating medium size obtuse marginal branch.  The mid to distal circumflex has a moderate disease, which is relatively diffuse up to about 40% to 50%.
The right coronary artery is around 4 mm in diameter.  It gives off conus branch, two medium size acute marginal branches, relatively large posterior descending artery and a posterior lateral branch.  In the mid portion of the right coronary artery at the origin of the first acute marginal branch, there is a relatively discrete stenosis of about 80% to 90%.  Proximally, there is an area of eccentric plaque, but seem to be non-flow limiting, at best around 20% to 30%.  Additionally, there is what appears to be like a shell-like lesion in the proximal segment of the right coronary artery as well.  The posterior descending artery has an eccentric plaque of about 40% to 50% in its mid segment.
PLAN:
Plan to consult cardiovascular surgery for consideration of coronary artery bypass surgery.  Continue risk factor modification, aspirin, and beta blocker.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?

[doctor] we found that you have a 50% distal left main and two-vessel coronary artery disease with normal left ventricular systolic function. we also found that you have frequent pvcs and metabolic syndrome.
[patient] what does that mean?
[doctor] it means that you have some blockages in your heart's vessels that could lead to heart disease or heart attack. we also found that you have frequent premature ventricular contractions, which are extra heartbeats that can cause your heart to beat out of rhythm. metabolic syndrome is a group of conditions that increase your risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.

"NAME OF PROCEDURE,1.  Left heart catheterization with left ventriculography and selective coronary angiography.
2.  Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent placement of the right coronary artery.
HISTORY:
This is a 58-year-old male who presented with atypical chest discomfort.  The patient had elevated troponins which were suggestive of a myocardial infarction.  The patient is suspected of having significant obstructive coronary artery disease, therefore he is undergoing cardiac catheterization.
PROCEDURE DETAILS:
Informed consent was given prior to the patient was brought to the catheterization laboratory.  The patient was brought to the catheterization laboratory in postabsorptive state.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion, 2% Xylocaine solution was used to anesthetize the right femoral region.  Using modified Seldinger technique, a 6-French arterial sheath was placed.  Then, the patient had already been on heparin.  Then, a Judkins left 4 catheter was intubated into the left main coronary artery.  Several projections were obtained and the catheter was removed.  A 3DRC catheter was intubated into the right coronary artery.  Several projections were obtained and the catheter was removed.  Then, a 3DRC guiding catheter was intubated into the right coronary artery.  Then, a universal wire was advanced across the lesion into the distal right coronary artery.  Integrilin was given.  Then, a 3.0 x 12 Voyager balloon was inflated at 13 atmospheres for 30 seconds.  Then, a projection was obtained.  Then, a 3.0 x 15 Vision stent was placed into the distal right coronary artery.  The stent was deployed at 15 atmospheres for 25 seconds.  Post stent, the patient was given intracoronary nitroglycerin after one projection.  Then, there was an attempt to place the intervention wire across the third posterolateral branch which was partially obstructed and this was not successful.  Then, a pilot 150 wire was advanced across the lesion.  Then, attempt to place the 2.0 x 8 power saver across the lesion was performed.  However, it was felt that there was adequate flow and no further intervention needed to be performed.  Then, the stent delivery system was removed.  A pigtail catheter was placed into the left ventricle.  Hemodynamics followed by left ventriculography was performed.  Then, a pullback gradient was performed and the catheter was removed.  Then, the right femoral artery was visualized and using angiography and then an Angio-Seal was applied.  The patient was transferred back to his room in good condition.
FINDINGS,1.  Hemodynamics:  The opening aortic pressure was 116/61 with a mean of 64.  The opening left ventricular pressure was 112 with end-diastolic pressure of 23.  LV pressure on pullback was 106 with end-diastolic pressure of 21.  Aortic pressure was 111/67 with a mean of 87.  The closing pressure was 110/67.
2.  Left ventriculography:  The left ventricle was of normal cavity, size, and wall thickness.  There is a mild anterolateral hypokinesis and moderate inferior and inferoapical hypokinesis.  The overall systolic function appeared to be mildly reduced with ejection fraction between 40% and 45%.  The mitral valve had no significant prolapse or regurgitation.  The aortic valve appeared to be trileaflet and moved normally.
3.  Coronary angiography:  The left main is a normal-caliber vessel.  This bifurcates into the left anterior descending and circumflex arteries.  The left main is free of any significant obstructive coronary artery disease.  The left anterior descending is a large vessel that extends to the apex.  It gives off approximately 10 septal perforators and 5 diagonal branches.  The first diagonal branch was large.  The left anterior descending had mild irregularities, but no high-grade disease.  The left circumflex is a nondominant vessel, which gives rise to two obtuse marginal branches.  The two obtuse marginal branches are large.  There is a relatively small left atrial branch.  The left circumflex had a 50% stenosis after the first obtuse marginal branch.  The rest of the vessel is moderately irregular, but no high-grade disease.  The right coronary artery appears to be a dominant vessel, which gives rise to three right ventricular branches, four posterior lateral branches, two right atrial branches, and two small conus branches.  The right coronary artery had moderate disease in its proximal segment with multiple areas of plaquing but no high-grade disease.  However, distal between the second and third posterolateral branch, there is a 90% stenosis.  The rest of the vessels had mild irregularities, but no high-grade disease.  Then percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the right coronary artery resulted in a 20% residual stenosis.  Then, after stent placement there was 0% residual stenosis; however, there was partial occlusion of the third posterolateral branch.  Then, a wire was advanced through this and there was improvement of flow.  There is improvement from TIMI grade 2 to TIMI grade 3 flow.
CLINICAL IMPRESSION,1.  Successful percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stent placement of the right coronary artery.
2.  Two-vessel coronary artery disease.
3.  Elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.
4.  Mild anterolateral and moderate inferoapical hypokinesis.
RECOMMENDATIONS,1.  Integrilin.
2.  Bed rest.
3.  Risk factor modification.
4.  Thallium scintigraphy in approximately six weeks.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] i'm feeling a bit tired, but overall okay.
[doctor] that's good to hear. i wanted to go over the details of the procedure with you. we performed a left heart catheterization with left ventriculography and selective coronary angiography, as well as a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent placement of your right coronary artery.
[patient] okay, can you explain what that means in simpler terms?
[doctor] sure. we inserted a catheter into your heart to take pictures and examine the blood vessels. we found some blockages in your coronary arteries, so we performed a procedure to open up the blocked artery and placed a small metal mesh tube called a stent to keep it open. we also administered a medication called integrilin to help prevent blood clots. 
[patient] i see. and what did the angiography show?
[doctor] the left main artery was normal, but there were some mild irregularities in the left anterior descending and left circumflex arteries. the right coronary artery had moderate disease in its proximal segment with multiple areas of plaquing and a 90% stenosis between the second and third posterolateral branch. however, after the procedure, there was no residual stenosis, but there was partial occlusion of the third posterolateral branch which we were able to improve. 
[patient] okay, and what's the clinical impression?
[doctor] the procedure was successful, and we diagnosed you with two-vessel coronary artery disease with mild anterolateral and moderate inferoapical hypokinesis. we also noted elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.
[patient] what's the next step?
[doctor] we recommend bed rest, risk factor modification, and a thallium scintigraphy in approximately six weeks to assess your heart function. it's important to make some lifestyle changes such as stopping smoking, eating a heart-healthy diet, and exercising regularly. we'll also monitor your progress to determine if any additional medications or procedures are necessary.

"PROCEDURE:
Left heart catheterization, left and right coronary angiography, left ventricular angiography, and intercoronary stenting of the right coronary artery.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
The patient was brought to the Catheterization Laboratory.  After informed consent, he was medicated with Versed and fentanyl.  The right groin was prepped and draped, and infiltrated with 2% Xylocaine.  Percutaneously, #6-French arterial sheath was placed.  Selective native left and right coronary angiography was performed followed by left ventricular angiography.  The patient had a totally occluded right coronary.  We initially started with a JR4 guide.  We were able to a sport wire through the total occlusion and saw a very tight stenosis.  We were able to get a 30 x 13 mm power saver balloon into the stenosis and dilated.  We then attempted to put a 30 x 12 mm stent across the stenosis, but we had very little guide support, the guide kept coming out.  We then switched to an AL1 guide and that too did not enable us to get anything to cross this lesion.  We finally had to go an AL2 guide, we were concerned that this could cause some proximal dissection.  That guided seated, we did have initial difficulty getting the wire back across the stenosis, and we did see a little staining suggesting we did have some tearing from the guide tip.  The surgeons were put on notice in case we could not get this vessel open, but we were able to re-cross with a sport wire.  We then re-dilated the area of stenosis and with good guide support, we were able to get a 30 x 23 mm Vision stent, where the lesion was and post-dilated it to 18 atmospheres.  Routine angiography did show that the distal posterolateral branch seems to be occluded, whether this was from distal wire dissection or distal thrombosis was unclear, but we were able to re-wire that area and get a 25 x12 Vision balloon and dilate the area and re-establish flow to the small segment.  We then came back because of the residual dissection proximal to the first stent and put a 30 x15 mm Vision stent at 18 atmospheres.  Final angiography showed resolution of the dissection.  We could see a little staining extrinsic to the stent.  No perforation and excellent flow.  During the intervention, we did give a bolus and drip of Angiomax.  At the end of the procedure, we stopped the Angiomax and gave 600 mg of Plavix.  We did a right femoral angiogram; however, the Angio-Seal plug could not take, so we used manual pressure and a Femostop.  We transported the patient to his room in stable condition.
ANGIOGRAPHIC DATA:
Left main coronary is normal.  Left anterior descending artery has a fair amount of wall disease proximally about 50 to 60% stenosis of the LAD before it bifurcates into diagonal.  The diagonal does appear to have about 50% osteal stenosis.  There is a lot of plaquing further down the diagonal, but good flow.  The rest of the LAD looked good pass the proximal 60% stenosis and after the diagonal branch.  Circumflex artery was nondominant vessel, consisting of an obtuse marginal vessel.  The first obtuse marginal had a long 50% narrowing and then the AV groove branch was free of any disease.  Some mild collaterals to the right were seen.  Right coronary angiography revealed a total occlusion of the right coronary, just about 0.5 cm after its origin.  After we got a wire across the area of occlusion, we could see some thrombosis and a 99% stenosis just at the curve.  Following the balloon angioplasty, we established good flow down the distal vessel.  We still had about residual 70% stenosis.  When we had to go back with the AL2 guide, we could see a little bit of staining in the proximal portion of the vessel that we did not notice previously and we felt that the tip of the guide caused a little bit of intimal dissection.  We re-dilated and then deployed.  Repeat angiography now did show some hang up off dye distally.  We never did have the wire that far down, so this was probably felt to be due to distal embolization of some thrombus.  After deploying the stent, we had total resolution of the original lesion.  We then directed our attention to the posterolateral branch, which the remainder of the vessel was patent giving off a large PDA.  The posterolateral branch appeared to be occluded in its mid portion.  We got a wire through and dilated this.  We then came back and put a second stent in the proximal area of the right coronary proximal and abutting to the previous stent.  Repeat angiography now showed no significant dissection, a little bit of contrast getting extrinsic to the stent probably in a little subintimal pouch, but this was excluded by the stent.  There were no filling defects in the stent and excellent flow.  The distal posterolateral branch did open up, although it was little under-filled and there may have been some mild residual disease there.
IMPRESSION:
Atherosclerotic heart disease with total occlusion of right coronary, successfully stented to zero residual with repair of a small proximal dissection.  Minor distal disease of the posterolateral branch and 60% proximal left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis and 50% diagonal stenosis along with 50% stenosis of the first obtuse marginal branch.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] a little sore, but otherwise alright.
[doctor] that's to be expected. so, during the procedure, we discovered that your right coronary artery was totally occluded. we were able to successfully place stents to repair the occlusion and address a small proximal dissection.
[patient] okay...
[doctor] we also found some minor distal disease in the posterolateral branch and 60% proximal left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis and 50% diagonal stenosis along with 50% stenosis of the first obtuse marginal branch.
[patient] what does that mean?
[doctor] well, it means that you have some plaque buildup in your arteries that could lead to further blockages if left untreated. we were able to address the blocked artery in the procedure, but we will need to monitor and manage the other areas of plaque buildup to prevent further blockages.
[patient] what will that involve?
[doctor] we will need to develop a treatment plan to manage your heart disease. this can include lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, as well as medication to lower your cholesterol and blood pressure. we will also need to monitor you closely and perform regular follow-up tests to ensure that your heart is functioning properly.
[patient] okay, i understand.
[doctor] great. do you have any other questions or concerns?
[patient] no, i think i understand what needs to be done.

","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the procedures?
[patient] hi, i’m feeling okay.
[doctor] i wanted to go over the results of your procedures. so, we found that there were no significant blockages in your coronary arteries, which is good news. however, we did find some issues with the functioning of your heart.
[patient] what kind of issues?
[doctor] we found that your left ventricle is dilated and not functioning as well as it should be. we estimated your ejection fraction to be between 45 to 50%, which is lower than what we would like to see. we also found that you have severe mitral regurgitation.
[patient] what does that mean?
[doctor] mitral regurgitation means that blood is leaking back into your heart through the mitral valve, which can put extra strain on your heart. we will need to monitor this closely to see if it worsens over time. 
[patient] is there anything we can do about it?
[doctor] the treatment plan will depend on the severity of your condition. we may need to consider medications, lifestyle changes, or even surgery to repair or replace the valve. but for now, we will continue to monitor your heart function and work on managing any symptoms you may experience.
[patient] okay, what about my hemodynamic data?
[doctor] your hemodynamic data was within normal limits, except for the elevated wedge pressure, which can be a sign of heart failure. we will need to monitor this closely and adjust your treatment plan if necessary.

"PROCEDURE:
Gastroscopy.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Barrett esophagus.
MEDICATIONS:
MAC.
PROCEDURE:
The Olympus gastroscope was introduced into the oropharynx and passed carefully through the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to the transverse duodenum.  The preparation was excellent and all surfaces were well seen.  The hypopharynx appeared normal.  The esophagus had a normal contour and normal mucosa throughout its distance, but at the distal end, there was a moderate-sized hiatal hernia noted.  The GE junction was seen at 40 cm and the hiatus was noted at 44 cm from the incisors.  Above the GE junction, there were three fingers of columnar epithelium extending cephalad, to a distance of about 2 cm.  This appears to be consistent with Barrett esophagus.  Multiple biopsies were taken from numerous areas in this region.  There was no active ulceration or inflammation and no stricture.  The hiatal hernia sac had normal mucosa except for one small erosion at the hiatus.  The gastric body had normal mucosa throughout.  Numerous small fundic gland polyps were noted, measuring 3 to 5 mm in size with an entirely benign appearance.  Biopsies were taken from the antrum to rule out Helicobacter pylori.  A retroflex view of the cardia and fundus confirmed the small hiatal hernia and demonstrated no additional lesions.  The scope was passed through the pylorus, which was patent and normal.  The mucosa throughout the duodenum in the first, second, and third portions was entirely normal.  The scope was withdrawn and the patient was sent to the recovery room.  He tolerated the procedure well.
FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  A short-segment Barrett esophagus.
2.  Hiatal hernia.
3.  Incidental fundic gland polyps in the gastric body.
4.  Otherwise, normal upper endoscopy to the transverse duodenum.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Follow up biopsy report.
2.  Continue PPI therapy.
3.  Follow up with Dr. X as needed.
4.  Surveillance endoscopy for Barrett in 3 years (if pathology confirms this diagnosis).","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after your gastroscopy procedure?

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
Dysphagia and esophageal spasm.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
Esophagitis and esophageal stricture.
PROCEDURE:
Gastroscopy.
MEDICATIONS:
MAC.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
The Olympus gastroscope was introduced into the oropharynx and passed carefully through the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum, to the third portion of the duodenum.  The hypopharynx was normal and the upper esophageal sphincter was unremarkable.  The esophageal contour was normal, with the gastroesophageal junction located at 38 cm from the incisors.  At this point, there were several linear erosions and a sense of stricturing at 38 cm.  Below this, there was a small hiatal hernia with the hiatus noted at 42 cm from the incisors.  The mucosa within the hernia was normal.  The gastric lumen was normal with normal mucosa throughout.  The pylorus was patent permitting passage of the scope into the duodenum, which was normal through the third portion.  During withdrawal of the scope, additional views were obtained of the cardia, confirming the presence of a small hiatal hernia.  It was decided to attempt dilation of the strictured area, so an 18-mm TTS balloon was placed across the stricture and inflated to the recommended diameter.  When the balloon was fully inflated, the lumen appeared to be larger than 18 mm diameter, suggesting that the stricture was in fact not a significant one.  No stretching of the mucosa took place.  The balloon was deflated and the scope was withdrawn.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room.
FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Esophagitis.
2.  Minor stricture at the gastroesophageal junction.
3.  Hiatal hernia.
4.  Otherwise normal upper endoscopy to the transverse duodenum.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Continue proton pump inhibitor therapy.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Oropharyngeal foreign body.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Foreign body, left vallecula at the base of the tongue.
2.  Airway is patent and stable.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
Flexible nasal laryngoscopy.
ANESTHESIA:
______ with viscous lidocaine nasal spray.
INDICATIONS:
The patient is a 39-year-old Caucasian male who presented to ABCD General Hospital Emergency Department with acute onset of odynophagia and globus sensation.  The patient stated his symptoms began around mid night after returning home _________ ingesting some chicken.  The patient felt that he had ingested a chicken bone, tried to dislodge this with fluids and other solid foods as well as sticking his finger down his throat without success.  The patient subsequently was seen in the Emergency Department where it was discovered that the patient had a left vallecular foreign body.  Department of Otolaryngology was asked to consult for further evaluation and treatment of this foreign body.
PROCEDURE:
After verbal informed consent was obtained, the patient was placed in the upright position.  The fiberoptic nasal laryngoscope was inserted in the patient's right naris and then the left naris.  There was visualized some bilateral caudal spurring of the septum.  The turbinates were within normal limits.  There was some posterior nasoseptal deviation to the left.  The nasal laryngoscope was then inserted back into the right naris and it was advanced along the floor of the nasal cavity.  The nasal mucous membranes were pink and moist.  There was no evidence of mass, ulceration, lesion, or obstruction.
The scope was further advanced to the level of the nasopharynx where the eustachian tubes were visualized bilaterally.  There was evidence of some mild erythema in the right fossa Rosenmüller.  There was no evidence of mass lesion or ulceration in this area, however.  The eustachian tubes were patent without obstruction.  The scope was further advanced to the level of the oropharynx where the base of the tongue, vallecula, and epiglottis were visualized.  There was evidence of a 1.5 cm left vallecular white foreign body.  The rest of the oropharynx was without abnormality.  The epiglottis was within normal limits and was noted to be omega in shape.  There was no edema or erythema to the epiglottis.  The scope was then further advanced to the level of the hypopharynx to the level of the true vocal cords.  There was no evidence of erythema or edema of the posterior commissure, arytenoid cartilage, or superior surface of the vocal cords.  The laryngeal surface of the epiglottis was within normal limits.  There was no evidence of mass lesion or nodularity of the vocal cords.  The patient was asked to Valsalva and the piriform sinuses were observed without evidence of foreign body or mass lesion.  The patient did have complete glottic closure upon phonation and the airway was patent and stable throughout the exam.  The glottic aperture was completely patent with inspiration.  The anterior commissure, epiglottic folds, false vocal cords, and piriform sinuses were all within normal limits.  The scope was then removed without difficulty.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and remained in stable condition.
FINDINGS:
1.  A 1.5 cm white foreign body consistent with a chicken bone at the left vallecular region.  There is no evidence of supraglottic or piriform sinuses foreign body.
2.  Mild erythema of the right nasopharynx in the region of the fossa Rosenmüller.  No mass is appreciated at this time.
PLAN:
The patient is to go to the operating room for direct laryngoscopy/microscopic suspension direct laryngoscopy for removal of foreign body under anesthesia this a.m.  Airway precautions were instituted.  The patient currently remained in stable condition.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, i'm good, thank you.
[doctor] i see that you came to the emergency department with complaints of odynophagia and globus sensation. can you tell me more about what happened?
[patient] yes, it all started after i ate some chicken last night. i felt like i had ingested a chicken bone and tried to get it out with fluids and solid foods, but it didn't work. i came to the emergency department and they found a foreign body in my left vallecula at the base of my tongue.
[doctor] okay, i see. we were consulted to further evaluate and treat this foreign body. i'd like to do a flexible nasal laryngoscopy to get a better look at the foreign body. is that okay with you?
[patient] yes, that's fine.
[doctor] alright, we'll also use some viscous lidocaine nasal spray for anesthesia. during the exam, we found a 1.5 cm white foreign body consistent with a chicken bone at the left vallecular region. there is no evidence of supraglottic or piriform sinuses foreign body. airway precautions were instituted, and you tolerated the procedure well. we need to remove the foreign body under anesthesia, so we'll be taking you to the operating room for direct laryngoscopy/microscopic suspension direct laryngoscopy. is that okay with you?

[patient] um, i'm good, thank you.
[doctor] so, i see you came in because of some trouble swallowing and a feeling like something is stuck in your throat. can you tell me a bit more about that?
[patient] yeah, so it all started last night after i ate some chicken. i felt like i had a bone stuck in my throat and tried drinking fluids and eating other foods to get it out, but it didn't work. that's why i came to the emergency department. they found a foreign object in my throat, in the left vallecula at the base of my tongue.
[doctor] okay, i see. we were consulted to help remove this object. i'd like to do a flexible nasal laryngoscopy to get a better view. is that okay with you?
[patient] yeah, sure.
[doctor] alright, during the exam, we found a white object, about 1.5 cm long, that looks like a chicken bone in the left vallecular region. we didn't find anything in the other areas. we'll need to remove it under anesthesia. so, we'll be taking you to the operating room for the procedure. is that okay with you?

"PROCEDURE:
Flexible sigmoidoscopy.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Rectal bleeding.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Diverticulosis.
MEDICATIONS:
None.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
The Olympus gastroscope was introduced through the rectum and advanced carefully through the colon for a distance of 90 cm, reaching the proximal descending colon.  At this point, stool occupied the lumen, preventing further passage.  The colon distal to this was well cleaned out and easily visualized.  The mucosa was normal throughout the regions examined.  Numerous diverticula were seen.  There was no blood or old blood or active bleeding.  A retroflexed view of the anorectal junction showed no hemorrhoids.  He tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room.
FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Sigmoid and left colon diverticulosis.
2.  Otherwise normal flexible sigmoidoscopy to the proximal descending colon.
3.  The bleeding was most likely from a diverticulum, given the self limited but moderately severe quantity that he described.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Follow up with Dr. X as needed.
2.  If there is further bleeding, a full colonoscopy is recommended.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?
[patient] hi, i am doing well, thank you.
[doctor] i see that you had a flexible sigmoidoscopy done. can you tell me what brought you in today?
[patient] i have been experiencing rectal bleeding, and my primary care physician recommended that i have a sigmoidoscopy done.
[doctor] okay, the sigmoidoscopy showed that you have diverticulosis in your sigmoid and left colon, which means that you have small bulges or pockets in your intestine. there was no active bleeding seen during the procedure, and the bleeding that you experienced was likely from a diverticulum. 
[patient] okay, that makes sense.
[doctor] if you have any further bleeding, it is recommended that you follow up with dr. x, and a full colonoscopy may be necessary to investigate further. 
[patient] got it. is there anything else i should be doing or any medications i should be taking?
[doctor] no, at this time no medications are necessary. it is important that you follow up with dr. x if there are any further symptoms or concerns.

Antral erythema; 2 cm polypoid pyloric channel tissue, questionable inflammatory polyp which was biopsied; duodenal erythema and erosion.
MEDICATIONS:
Fentanyl 200 mcg and versed 6 mg.
SCOPE:
GIF-Q180.
PROCEDURE DETAIL:
Following the preprocedure patient assessment the procedure, goals, risks including bleeding, perforation and side effects of medications and alternatives were reviewed.  Questions were answered.  Pause preprocedure was performed.
Following titrated intravenous sedation the flexible video endoscope was introduced into the esophagus and advanced to the second portion of the duodenum without difficulty.  The esophagus appeared to have normal motility and mucosa.  Regular Z line was located at 44 cm from incisors.  No erosion or ulceration.  No esophagitis.
Upon entering the stomach gastric mucosa was examined in detail including retroflexed views of cardia and fundus.  There was pyloric channel and antral erythema, but no visible erosion or ulceration.  There was a 2 cm polypoid pyloric channel tissue which was suspicious for inflammatory polyp.  This was biopsied and was placed separately in bottle #2.  Random gastric biopsies from antrum, incisura and body were obtained and placed in separate jar, bottle #1.  No active ulceration was found.
Upon entering the duodenal bulb there was extensive erythema and mild erosions, less than 3 mm in length, in first portion of duodenum, duodenal bulb and junction of first and second part of the duodenum.  Postbulbar duodenum looked normal.
The patient was assessed upon completion of the procedure.  Okay to discharge once criteria met.

"PROCEDURE:
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy and snare polypectomy.
INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE:
Iron-deficiency anemia.
MEDICATIONS:
MAC.
The risks of the procedure were made aware to the patient and consisted of medication reaction, bleeding, perforation, and aspiration.
PROCEDURE:
After informed consent and appropriate sedation, the upper endoscope was inserted into the oropharynx down into the stomach and beyond the pylorus and the second portion of the duodenum. The duodenal mucosa was completely normal. The pylorus was normal. In the stomach, there was evidence of diffuse atrophic-appearing nodular gastritis. Multiple biopsies were obtained. There also was a 1.5-cm adenomatous appearing polyp along the greater curvature at the junction of the body and antrum. There was mild ulceration on the tip of this polyp. It was decided to remove the polyp via snare polypectomy. Retroflexion was performed, and this revealed a small hiatal hernia in the distal esophagus. The Z-line was identified and was unremarkable. The esophageal mucosa was normal.
FINDINGS:
1. Hiatal hernia.
2. Diffuse nodular and atrophic appearing gastritis, biopsies taken.
3. A 1.5-cm polyp with ulceration along the greater curvature, removed.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Follow up biopsies.
2. Continue PPI.
3. Hold Lovenox for 5 days.
4. Place SCDs.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, i'm doing well, thank you.
[doctor] good to hear that. so, i have your test results from your esophagogastroduodenoscopy. your stomach had some inflammation and nodules, and we took some biopsies to send for further testing. also, we found a 1.5cm adenomatous polyp in your stomach which we have removed. do you have any questions?
[patient] no, not really. what does that mean for me?
[doctor] well, the biopsies will help us better understand the inflammation and nodules in your stomach, and the removal of the polyp is a positive development as it was showing early signs of potentially becoming cancerous. the only other finding was a small hiatal hernia in your distal esophagus, which is not a significant issue.
[patient] okay, that makes sense. what should i do next?
[doctor] we will need to follow up on the results of the biopsies once they come back. in the meantime, i recommend continuing your proton pump inhibitor medication and holding your lovenox for five days. we will also place some scds. these are compression stockings that help prevent blood clots in your legs. does that sound good to you?

[doctor] great to hear. so, i got the test results back from your esophagogastroduodenoscopy. we found some inflammation and nodules in your stomach, and we took some biopsies to get more information. also, we removed a 1.5cm adenomatous polyp from your stomach. any questions on that so far?
[patient] umm... not really. what does that mean for me exactly?
[doctor] well, the biopsies will give us a better understanding of the inflammation and nodules in your stomach. removing the polyp was a good thing since it showed signs of potentially becoming cancerous. we also found a small hiatal hernia in your distal esophagus, but that's not a big deal. does that all make sense so far?
[patient] mm-hmm, yeah i get it. what do i need to do next?
[doctor] for now, we'll wait for the biopsy results to come back. in the meantime, keep taking your proton pump inhibitor medication and hold off on your lovenox for five days. we'll also give you some scds, which are compression stockings to help prevent blood clots in your legs. does that all sound good to you?
[patient] yeah, that's cool. thank you for explaining everything to me.
[doctor] no problem at all. is there anything else you want to talk about?
[patient] nope, i think that's it for now.
[doctor] alright, well if you have any concerns or questions, just let us know. take care and stay healthy.",2
"PROCEDURE:
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with brush cytology and biopsy.
INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE:
Patient with a history of chronic abdominal pain and CT showing evidence of chronic pancreatitis, with a recent upper endoscopy showing an abnormal-appearing ampulla.
MEDICATIONS:
General anesthesia.
The risks of the procedure were made aware to the patient and consisted of medication reaction, bleeding, perforation, aspiration, and post ERCP pancreatitis.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
After informed consent and appropriate sedation, the duodenoscope was inserted into the oropharynx, down the esophagus, and into the stomach. The scope was then advanced through the pylorus to the ampulla. The ampulla had a markedly abnormal appearance, as it was enlarged and very prominent. It extended outward with an almost polypoid shape. It had what appeared to be adenomatous-appearing mucosa on the tip. There also was ulceration noted on the tip of this ampulla. The biliary and pancreatic orifices were identified. This was located not at the tip of the ampulla, but rather more towards the base. Cannulation was performed with a Wilson-Cooke TriTome sphincterotome with easy cannulation of the biliary tree. The common bile duct was mildly dilated, measuring approximately 12 mm. The intrahepatic ducts were minimally dilated. There were no filling defects identified. There was felt to be a possible stricture within the distal common bile duct, but this likely represented an anatomic variant given the abnormal shape of the ampulla. The patient has no evidence of obstruction based on lab work and clinically. Nevertheless, it was decided to proceed with brush cytology of this segment. This was done without any complications. There was adequate drainage of the biliary tree noted throughout the procedure. Multiple efforts were made to access the pancreatic ductal anatomy; however, because of the shape of the ampulla, this was unsuccessful. Efforts were made to proceed in a long scope position, but still were unsuccessful. Next, biopsies were obtained of the ampulla away from the biliary orifice. Four biopsies were taken. There was some minor oozing which had ceased by the end of the procedure. The stomach was then decompressed and the endoscope was withdrawn.
FINDINGS:
1. Abnormal papilla with bulging, polypoid appearance, and looks adenomatous with ulceration on the tip; biopsies taken.
2. Cholangiogram reveals mildly dilated common bile duct measuring 12 mm and possible distal CBD stricture, although I think this is likely an anatomic variant; brush cytology obtained.
3. Unable to access the pancreatic duct.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. NPO except ice chips today.
2. Will proceed with MRCP to better delineate pancreatic ductal anatomy.
3. Follow up biopsies and cytology.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after your procedure?
[patient] hi doctor, i'm feeling alright, just a bit tired.
[doctor] that's normal. i wanted to go over the results of your procedure with you. we found an abnormality in your ampulla, which is the opening where the bile duct and pancreatic duct meet. we took four biopsies of it and performed brush cytology to test for any abnormal cells. additionally, we found a mild dilation of your common bile duct, and there may be a possible stricture at the distal common bile duct, although it's likely just an anatomic variant. unfortunately, we were unable to access your pancreatic duct despite multiple attempts due to the abnormal shape of your ampulla. 
[patient] okay, what does this all mean?
[doctor] well, the results suggest that there may be an abnormality in your pancreas or bile ducts, which could be causing your chronic abdominal pain. we will need to proceed with an mrcp, which is a type of imaging, to get a better look at your pancreatic ductal anatomy. we will also need to follow up on the biopsies and cytology results. 
[patient] alright, what do i need to do next?
[doctor] you will need to be npo except for ice chips today, and we will schedule your mrcp for the near future. in the meantime, if you experience any severe abdominal pain, fever, or chills, please call our office right away.","[doctor] hey there, how are ya feeling after your procedure?
[patient] hey doc, i'm feeling alright, just a liiittle tired.
[doctor] mm-hmm, that's normal. just wanted to chat with ya about the results of your procedure. we found something abnormal in your ampulla, which is where your bile duct and pancreatic duct meet. so, we took four biopsies and did a brush cytology to check for any abnormal cells. we also noticed a mild dilation of your common bile duct, and there might be a stricture at the distal common bile duct, but it's prob just a normal variation. unfortunately, we couldn't get to your pancreatic duct because of the weird shape of your ampulla. 
[patient] uh, okay. so, what does this all mean?
[doctor] well, it seems like there might be something weird going on in your pancreas or bile ducts, which could be causing your chronic abdominal pain. so, we need to do an mrcp, which is a type of imaging, to get a better view of your pancreatic ductal anatomy. and of course, we need to keep an eye on those biopsies and cytology results. 
[patient] got it. what's next?
[doctor] today, you need to avoid food and drinks, except for ice chips. and we'll schedule your mrcp soon. if you have any severe abdominal pain, fever or chills, please let us know right away. sound good?",2
"PROCEDURE:
Upper endoscopy with biopsy.
PROCEDURE INDICATION:
This is a 44-year-old man who was admitted for coffee-ground emesis, which has been going on for the past several days.  An endoscopy is being done to evaluate for source of upper GI bleeding.
Informed consent was obtained.  Outlining the risks, benefits and alternatives of the procedure included, but not to risks of bleeding, infection, perforation, the patient agreed for the procedure.

"INDICATIONS:
Dysphagia.
PREMEDICATION:
Topical Cetacaine spray and Versed IV.
PROCEDURE:
:  The scope was passed into the esophagus under direct vision.  The esophageal mucosa was all unremarkable.  There was no evidence of any narrowing present anywhere throughout the esophagus and no evidence of esophagitis.  The scope was passed on down into the stomach.  The gastric mucosa was all examined including a retroflexed view of the fundus and there were no abnormalities seen.  The scope was then passed into the duodenum and the duodenal bulb and second and third portions of the duodenum were unremarkable.  The scope was again slowly withdrawn through the esophagus and no evidence of narrowing was present.  The scope was then withdrawn.
IMPRESSION:
Normal upper GI endoscopy without any evidence of anatomical narrowing.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?
[patient] hi, i'm doing fine, thank you.

"PROCEDURE:
Endoscopy.
CLINICAL INDICATIONS:
Intermittent rectal bleeding with abdominal pain.
ANESTHESIA:
Fentanyl 100 mcg and 5 mg of IV Versed.
PROCEDURE:
The patient was taken to the GI lab and placed in the left lateral supine position.  Continuous pulse oximetry and blood pressure monitoring were in place.  After informed consent was obtained, the video endoscope was inserted over the dorsum of the tongue without difficulty.  With swallowing, the scope was advanced down the esophagus into the body of the stomach.  The scope was further advanced down to the antrum and through the pylorus into the duodenum, which was visualized into its second portion.  It appeared free of stricture, neoplasm, or ulceration.  Samples were obtained from the antrum and prepyloric area to check for Helicobacter, rapid urease, and additional samples were sent to pathology.  Retroflexion view of the fundus of the stomach was normal without evidence of a hiatal hernia.  The scope was then slowly removed.  The distal esophagus appeared benign with a normal-appearing gastroesophageal sphincter and no esophagitis.  The remaining portion of the esophagus was normal.
IMPRESSION:
Abdominal pain.  Symptoms most consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease without endoscopic evidence of hiatal hernia.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Await results of CLO testing and biopsies.  Return to clinic with Dr. Spencer in 2 weeks for further discussion.","[doctor] hi there, thanks for coming in today. i understand that you've been experiencing some intermittent rectal bleeding and abdominal pain. how long has this been going on?

"PROCEDURE:
This tracing was obtained utilizing silver chloride biopotential electrodes placed at the medial and lateral canthi at both eyes and on the superior and inferior orbital margins of the left eye along a vertical line drawn through the middle of the pupil in the neutral forward gaze.  Simultaneous recordings were made in both eyes in the horizontal direction and the left eye in the vertical directions.  Caloric irrigations were performed using a closed loop irrigation system at 30 degrees and 44 degrees C into either ear.
FINDINGS:
Gaze testing did not reveal any evidence of nystagmus.  Saccadic movements did not reveal any evidence of dysmetria or overshoot.  Sinusoidal tracking was performed well for the patient's age.  Optokinetic nystagmus testing was performed poorly due to the patient's difficulty in following the commands.  Therefore adequate OKNs were not achieved.  The Dix-Hallpike maneuver in the head handing left position resulted in moderate intensity left beating nystagmus, which was converted to a right beating nystagmus when she sat up again.  The patient complained of severe dizziness in this position.  There was no clear-cut decremental response with repetition.  In the head hanging left position, no significant nystagmus was identified.  Positional testing in the supine, head hanging, head right, head left, right lateral decubitus, and left lateral decubitus positions did not reveal any evidence of nystagmus.
Caloric stimulation revealed a calculated unilateral weakness of 7.0% on the right (normal <20%) and left beating directional preponderance of 6.0% (normal <20-30%).
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal electronystagmogram demonstrating prominent nystagmus on position testing in the head hanging right position.  No other significant nystagmus was noted.  There was no evidence of clear-cut caloric stimulation abnormality.  This study would be most consistent with a right vestibular dysfunction.","[doctor] hi, how are you? i'm going over your test results from the electronystagmogram that we performed.
[patient] hi, i'm doing okay. what did you find out?
[doctor] well, the test revealed that there is prominent nystagmus on position testing when you were in the head hanging right position. this suggests that there may be an issue with your right vestibular function.
[patient] what does that mean?
[doctor] the vestibular system is responsible for your balance and spatial orientation. it's located in your inner ear, and it helps your brain understand your position and movement. based on the test results, it's possible that there is a problem with the right side of this system.
[patient] is there anything that can be done to fix it?
[doctor] there may be some treatments that could help. we'll need to do some further testing to determine the cause of the issue and then we can discuss potential treatments. the caloric stimulation test did not show any significant abnormalities, which is a good sign.
[patient] okay, what's the next step?
[doctor] i'm going to refer you to an ear, nose, and throat specialist who can help us further investigate the issue. they may want to perform an mri or other tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. in the meantime, try to avoid any activities that could cause dizziness or falls.
[patient] alright, thank you. i'll follow up with the ent specialist.
[doctor] great, let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.","[doctor] hi, how are you? just going over your test results from the electronystagmogram we performed, um.

"EXAM:
CT of abdomen with and without contrast.  CT-guided needle placement biopsy.
HISTORY:
Left renal mass.
TECHNIQUE:
Pre and postcontrast enhanced images were acquired through the kidneys.
FINDINGS:
Comparison made to the prior MRI.  There is re-demonstration of multiple bilateral cystic renal lesions.  Several of these demonstrate high attenuation in the precontrast phase of the exam suggesting that they are hemorrhagic cysts.  There was however one cyst seen in the lower pole of the left kidney, which demonstrated apparent enhancement from 30 to 70 Hounsfield units post contrast administration.  This measured approximately 1.4 x 1.3 cm to the exophytic half of the lower pole.  No other enhancing renal masses were seen.  The visualized liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands were unremarkable.  There are changes of cholecystectomy.  Mild prominence of the common bile duct is likely secondary to cholecystectomy.  There is no abdominal lymphadenopathy, masses, fluid collection, or ascites.
Lung bases are clear.  No acute bony pathology was noted.
IMPRESSION:
Solitary apparently enhancing left renal mass in the lower pole as described.  Renal cell carcinoma cannot be excluded.
CT-GUIDED NEEDLE BIOPSY, LEFT KIDNEY MASS:
Following discussion of risks, benefits, and alternatives, the patient wished to proceed with CT-guided biopsy of left renal lesion.  The patient was placed in the decubitus position.  The region overlying the left renal mass of note was marked.  Area was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia was achieved with approximately 8 mL of 1% lidocaine with bicarbonate.  The Versed and fentanyl were given to achieve conscious sedation.  Utilizing an 18 x 15 gauge coaxial system, 3 core biopsies were obtained through the mass in question, and sent to pathology for analysis.  Following procedure, scans through the region demonstrate a small subcutaneous hematoma in the region of the superficial anesthesia.  No perinephric fluid/hematoma was identified.  The patient tolerated the procedure without immediate complications.
IMPRESSION:
Three core biopsies through the region of the left renal tumor as described.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm doing okay, thanks.
[doctor] so, i have your test results here and it appears that there is a solitary enhancing mass in your left kidney. we cannot exclude the possibility of renal cell carcinoma. 
[patient] oh no, what does that mean?
[doctor] renal cell carcinoma is a type of kidney cancer. we need to do a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.

"REASON FOR EXAM:  This 60-year-old female who was found to have a solid indeterminate mass involving the inferior pole of the right kidney was referred for percutaneous biopsy under CT guidance at the request of Dr. X.
PROCEDURE:  The procedure risks and possible complications including, but not limited to severe hemorrhage which could result in emergent surgery, were explained to the patient.  The patient understood.  All questions were answered, and informed consent was obtained.  With the patient in the prone position, noncontrasted CT localization images were obtained through the kidney.  Conscious sedation was utilized with the patient being monitored.  The patient was administered divided dose of Versed and fentanyl intravenously.
Following sterile preparation and local anesthesia to the posterior aspect of the right flank, an 18-gauge co-axial Temno-type needle was directed into the inferior pole right renal mass from the posterior oblique approach.  Two biopsy specimens were obtained and placed in 10% formalin solution.  CT documented needle placement.  Following the biopsy, there was active bleeding through the stylet, as well as a small hematoma about the inferior aspect of the right kidney posteriorly.  I placed several torpedo pledgets of Gelfoam through the co-axial sheath into the site of bleeding.  The bleeding stopped.  The co-axial sheath was then removed.  Bandage was applied.  Hemostasis was obtained.  The patient was placed in the supine position.  Postbiopsy CT images were then obtained.  The patient's hematoma appeared stable.  The patient was without complaints of pain or discomfort.  The patient was then sent to her room with plans of observing for approximately 4 hours and then to be discharged, as stable.  The patient was instructed to remain at bedrest for the remaining portions of the day at home and patient is to followup with Dr. Fieldstone for the results and follow-up care.
FINDINGS:  Initial noncontrasted CT localization images reveals the presence of an approximately 2.1 cm cortical mass involving the posterior aspect of the inferior pole of the right kidney.  Images obtained during the biopsy reveals the cutting portion of the biopsy needle to extend through the mass.  Images obtained following the biopsy reveals the development of a small hematoma posterior to the right kidney in its inferior pole adjacent to the mass.  There are small droplets of air within the hematoma.  No hydronephrosis is identified.
CONCLUSION:
1.  Percutaneous biopsy of inferior pole right renal mass under computed tomography guidance with specimen sent to laboratory in 10% formalin solution.
2.  Development of a small hematoma adjacent to the inferior pole of the right kidney with active bleeding through the biopsy needle stopped by tract embolization with Gelfoam pledgets.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?
[patient] i’m feeling okay, just a little sore where the biopsy was done.

"NAME OF PROCEDURE,1.  Selective coronary angiography.
2.  Placement of overlapping 3.0 x 18 and 3.0 x 8 mm Xience stents in the proximal right coronary artery.
3.  Abdominal aortography.
INDICATIONS:
The patient is a 65-year-old gentleman with a history of exertional dyspnea and a cramping-like chest pain.  Thallium scan has been negative.  He is undergoing angiography to determine if his symptoms are due to coronary artery disease.
NARRATIVE:
The right groin was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion and the area of the right coronary artery anesthetized with 2% lidocaine.  Constant sedation was obtained using Versed 1 mg and fentanyl 50 mcg.  Received additional Versed and fentanyl during the procedure.  Please refer to the nurses' notes for dosages and timing.
The right femoral artery was entered and a 4-French sheath was placed.  Advancement of the guidewire demonstrated some obstruction at the level of abdominal aorta.  Via the right Judkins catheter, the guidewire was easily infiltrated to the thoracic aorta and over aortic arch.  The right Judkins catheter was advanced to the origin of the right coronary artery where selective angiograms were performed.  This revealed a very high-grade lesion at the proximal right coronary artery.  This catheter was exchanged for a left #4 Judkins catheter which was advanced to the ostium of the left main coronary artery where selective angiograms were performed.
The patient was found to have the above mentioned high-grade lesion in the right coronary artery and a coronary intervention was performed.  A 6-French sheath and a right Judkins guide was placed.  The patient was started on bivalarudin.  A BMW wire was easily placed across the lesion and into the distal right coronary artery.  A 3.0 x 15 mm Voyager balloon was placed and deployed at 10 atmospheres.  The intermediate result was improved with TIMI-3 flow to the terminus of the vessel.  Following this, a 3.0 x 18 mm Xience stent was placed across the lesion and deployed at 17 atmospheres.  This revealed excellent result however at the very distal of the stent there was an area of haziness but no definite dissection.  This was stented with a 3.0 x 8 mm Xience stent deployed again at 17 atmospheres.  Final angiograms revealed excellent result with TIMI-3 flow at the terminus of the right coronary artery and approximately 10% residual stenosis at the worst point of the narrowing.  The guiding catheter was withdrawn over wire and a pigtail was placed.  This was advanced to the abdominal aorta at the area of obstruction and small injection of contrast was given demonstrating that there was a small aneurysm versus a small retrograde dissection in that area with some dye hang up after injection.  The catheter was removed.  The bivalarudin was stopped at the termination of procedure.  A small injection of contrast given through arterial sheath and Angio-Seal was placed without incident.
It should also be noted that an 8-French sheath was placed in the right femoral vein.  This was placed initially as the patient was going to have a right heart catheterization as well because of the dyspnea.
Total contrast media, 205 mL, total fluoroscopy time was 7.5 minutes, X-ray dose, 2666 milligray.
HEMODYNAMICS:
Rhythm was sinus throughout the procedure.  Aortic pressure was 170/81 mmHg.
The right coronary artery is a dominant vessel.  This vessel gives rise to conus branch and two small RV free wall branches and PDA and a small left ventricular branch.  It should be noted that there was competitive flow in the posterior left ventricular branch and that the distal right coronary artery fills via left sided collaterals.  In the proximal right coronary artery, there is a large ulcerative plaque followed immediately by a severe stenosis that is subtotal in severity.  After intervention, there is TIMI-3 flow to the terminus of the right coronary with better fill into the distal right coronary artery and loss of competitive flow.  There was approximately 10% residual stenosis at the worst part of the previous stenosis.
The left main is without disease and trifurcates into a moderate-sized ramus intermedius, the LAD and the circumflex.  The ramus intermedius is free of disease.  The LAD terminates at the LV apex and has elongated area of mild stenosis at its mid segment.  This measures 25% to 30% at its worst point.  The circumflex is a large caliber vessel.  There is a proximal 15% to 20% stenosis and an area of ectasia in the proximal circumflex.  Distally, this circumflex gives rise to a large bifurcating marginal artery and beyond that point, the circumflex is a small vessel within the AV groove.
The aortogram demonstrates eccentric aneurysm formation.  This may represent a small retrograde dissection as well.  There was some dye hang up in the wall.
IMPRESSION,1.  Successful stenting of subtotal stenosis of the proximal coronary artery.
2.  Non-obstructive coronary artery disease in the mid left anterior descending as described above and ectasia of the proximal circumflex coronary artery.
3.  Left to right collateral filling noted prior to coronary intervention.
4.  Small area of eccentric aneurysm formation in the abdominal aorta.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] hi, i am feeling a little sore near the groin area. overall, i am doing okay.
[doctor] okay, that is expected after the procedure. let me go over the results with you. during the angiogram, we found a high-grade lesion in your proximal right coronary artery, which we were able to successfully treat with stents. we placed overlapping 3.0 x 18 and 3.0 x 8 mm xience stents in the artery. the stenting resulted in excellent flow with approximately 10% residual stenosis at the worst point of the narrowing.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Alternating hard and soft stools.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Sigmoid diverticulosis.
Sessile polyp of the sigmoid colon.
Pedunculated polyp of the sigmoid colon.
PROCEDURE:
Total colonoscopy with biopsy and snare polypectomy.
PREP:
4/4.
DIFFICULTY:
1/4.
PREMEDICATION AND SEDATION:
Fentanyl 100, midazolam 5.
INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE:
A 64-year-old male who has developed alternating hard and soft stools.  He has one bowel movement a day.
FINDINGS:
There is extensive sigmoid diverticulosis, without evidence of inflammation or bleeding.  There was a small, sessile polyp in the sigmoid colon, and a larger pedunculated polyp in the sigmoid colon, both appeared adenomatous.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
Preoperative counseling, including an explicit discussion of the risk and treatment of perforation was provided.  Preoperative physical examination was performed.  Informed consent was obtained.  The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  Premedications were given slowly by intravenous push.  Rectal examination was performed, which was normal.  The scope was introduced and passed with minimal difficulty to the cecum.  This was verified anatomically and video photographs were taken of the ileocecal valve and appendiceal orifice.  The scope was slowly withdrawn, the mucosa carefully visualized.  It was normal in its entirety until reaching the sigmoid colon.  Sigmoid colon had extensive diverticular disease, small-mouth, without inflammation or bleeding.  In addition, there was a small sessile polyp, which was cold biopsied and recovered, and approximately an 8 mm pedunculated polyp.  A snare was placed on the stalk of the polyp and divided with electrocautery.  The polyp was recovered and sent for pathologic examination.  Examination of the stalk showed good hemostasis.  The scope was slowly withdrawn and the remainder of the examination was normal.
ASSESSMENT:
Diverticular disease.  A diverticular disease handout was given to the patient's wife and a high fiber diet was recommended.  In addition, 2 polyps, one of which is assuredly an adenoma.  Patient needs a repeat colonoscopy in 3 years.","[doctor]: hi, how are you feeling?
[patient]: hi, i'm doing okay.

1.  Colon cancer screening.
2.  Family history of colon polyps.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Multiple colon polyps (5).
2.  Diverticulosis, sigmoid colon.
3.  Internal hemorrhoids.
ENDOSCOPE USED:
EC3870LK.
BIOPSIES:
Biopsies taken from all polyps.  Hot biopsy got applied to one.  Epinephrine sclerotherapy and snare polypectomy applied to four polyps.
ANESTHESIA:
Fentanyl 75 mcg, Versed 6 mg, and glucagon 1.5 units IV push in divided doses.  Also given epinephrine 1:20,000 total of 3 mL.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
PROCEDURE:
The patient was placed in left lateral decubitus after appropriate sedation.  Digital rectal examination was done, which was normal.  Endoscope was introduced and passed through a rather spastic tortuous sigmoid colon with multiple diverticula seen all the way through transverse colon where about 1 cm x 1 cm sessile polyp was seen.  It was biopsied and then in piecemeal fashion removed using snare polypectomy after base was infiltrated with epinephrine.  Pedunculated polyp next to it was hard to see and there was a lot of peristalsis.  The scope then was advanced through rest of the transverse colon to ascending colon and cecum.  Terminal ileum was briefly reviewed, appeared normal and so did cecum after copious amount of fecal material was irrigated out.  Ascending colon was unremarkable.  At hepatic flexure may be proximal transverse colon, there was a sessile polyp about 1.2 cm x 1 cm that was removed in the same manner with a biopsy taken, base infiltrated with epinephrine and at least two passes of snare polypectomy and subsequent hot biopsy cautery removed to hold polypoid tissue, which could be seen.  In transverse colon on withdrawal and relaxation with epinephrine, an additional 1 mm to 2 mm sessile polyp was removed by hot biopsy.  Then in the transverse colon, additional larger polyp about 1.3 cm x 1.2 cm was removed in piecemeal fashion again with epinephrine, sclerotherapy, and snare polypectomy.  Subsequently pedunculated polyp in distal transverse colon near splenic flexure was removed with snare polypectomy.  The rest of the splenic flexure and descending colon were unremarkable.  Diverticulosis was again seen with almost constant spasm despite of glucagon.  Sigmoid colon did somewhat hinder the inspection of that area.  Rectum, retroflexion posterior anal canal showed internal hemorrhoids moderate to large.  Excess of air insufflated was removed.  The endoscope was withdrawn.
PLAN:
Await biopsy report.  Pending biopsy report, recommendation will be made when the next colonoscopy should be done at least three years perhaps sooner besides and due to multitude of the patient's polyps.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the procedure?

"PROCEDURE:
Colonoscopy.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
Rectal bleeding and perirectal abscess.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Perianal abscess.
MEDICATIONS:
MAC.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
The Olympus pediatric variable colonoscope was introduced through the rectum and advanced carefully through the colon into the cecum and then through the ileocecal valve into the terminal ileum.  The preparation was excellent and all surfaces were well seen.  The mucosa throughout the colon and in the terminal ileum was normal, with no evidence of colitis.  Special attention was paid to the rectum, including retroflexed views of the distal rectum and the anorectal junction.  There was no evidence of either inflammation or a fistulous opening.  The scope was withdrawn.  A careful exam of the anal canal and perianal area demonstrated a jagged 8-mm opening at the anorectal junction posteriorly (12 o'clock position).  Some purulent material could be expressed through the opening.  There was no suggestion of significant perianal reservoir of inflamed tissue or undrained material.  Specifically, the posterior wall of the distal rectum and anal canal were soft and unremarkable.  In addition, scars were noted in the perianal area.  The first was a small dimpled scar, 1 cm from the anal verge in the 11 o'clock position.  The second was a dimpled scar about 5 cm from the anal verge on the left buttock's cheek.  There were no other abnormalities noted.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room.
FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Normal colonoscopy to the terminal ileum.
2.  Opening in the skin at the external anal verge, consistent with drainage from a perianal abscess, with no palpable abscess at this time, and with no evidence of fistulous connection to the bowel lumen.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Continue antibiotics.
2.  Followup with Dr. X.
3.  If drainage persists, consider surgical drainage.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after your colonoscopy?

MEDICATIONS:
Fentanyl 100 mcg and versed 10 mg.
PROCEDURE DETAIL:
Following the preprocedure patient assessment the procedure, goals, risks including bleeding, perforation, missed polyp rate as well as side effects of medications and alternatives were reviewed.  Questions were answered.  Pause preprocedure was performed.
Following titrated intravenous sedation the flexible video endoscope was introduced into the rectum and advanced to the cecum without difficulty.  The ileocecal valve looked normal.  Preparation was fair allowing examination of 85% of mucosa after washing and cleaning with tap water through the scope.  The terminal ileum was intubated through the ileocecal valve for a 5 cm extent.  Terminal ileum mucosa looked normal.
Then the scope was withdrawn while examining the mucosa carefully including the retroflexed views of the rectum.  No polyp, no diverticulum and no bleeding source was identified.
The patient was assessed upon completion of the procedure.  Okay to discharge once criteria met.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Diverticulosis in the sigmoid.
2.  Otherwise normal colonoscopy to the cecum.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Follow up with Dr. X as needed.
2.  Screening colonoscopy in 2 years.
3.  Additional evaluation for other causes of anemia may be appropriate.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after your colonoscopy?
[patient] hi, i'm feeling okay, a little groggy still.
[doctor] that's normal, the medication we gave you can make you feel that way. so, i have the results of your procedure here. you have diverticulosis in the sigmoid colon, but otherwise, your colonoscopy was normal up to the cecum.
[patient] oh, okay. is that something to be concerned about?
[doctor] not necessarily. diverticulosis is a common condition that affects many people as they age. we'll want to follow up with dr. x as needed and we recommend a screening colonoscopy in 2 years. additionally, given your preoperative diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia, it may be appropriate to evaluate for other causes of anemia.
[patient] okay, thank you for letting me know. is there anything i need to do in the meantime?
[doctor] no, not at this time. we'll keep an eye on it and let you know if any further action is needed. if you have any concerns or symptoms in the meantime, don't hesitate to reach out to us.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Epistaxis and chronic dysphonia.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Atrophic dry nasal mucosa.
2.  Epistaxis.
3.  Atrophic laryngeal changes secondary to inhaled steroid use.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
1.  Cauterization of epistaxis, left nasal septum.
2.  Fiberoptic nasal laryngoscopy.
ANESTHESIA:
Neo-Synephrine with lidocaine nasal spray.
FINDINGS:
1.  Atrophic dry cracked nasal mucosa.
2.  Atrophic supraglottic and glottic changes likely secondary to inhaled steroids and recent endotracheal tube intubation.
INDICATIONS:
The patient is a 37-year-old African-American female who was admitted to ABCD General Hospital with a left wrist abscess.  The patient was taken to the operating room for incision and drainage.  Postoperatively, the patient was placed on nasal cannula oxygen and developed subsequent epistaxis.  Upon evaluating the patient, the patient complains of epistaxis from the left naris as well as some chronic dysphonia that had become exacerbated after surgery.  The patient does report of having endotracheal tube intubation during anesthesia.  The patient also gives a history of inhaled steroid use for her asthma.
The patient was extubated after surgery without difficulty, but continued to have some difficulty and the Department of Otolaryngology was asked to evaluate the patient regarding epistaxis and dysphonia.
PROCEDURE DETAILS:
After the procedure was described, the patient was placed in the seated position.  The fiberoptic nasal laryngoscope was then inserted into the patient's left naris.  The nasal mucosal membranes were dry and atrophic throughout.  There was no evidence of any mass lesions.  The nasal laryngoscope was then advanced towards the posterior aspect of the nasal cavity.  There was no evidence of mass, ulceration, lesion, or obstruction.  The nasolaryngoscopy continued to be advanced into the oropharynx and the vallecula and the base of the tongue were evaluated and were without evidence of mass lesion or ulceration.
The fiberoptic scope was further advanced and visualization of the larynx revealed some atrophic, dry, supraglottic, and glottic changes.  There was no evidence of any local mass lesion, nodule, or ulcerations.  There was no evidence of any erythema.  Upon phonation, the vocal cords approximated completely and upon inspiration, the true vocal cords were abducted in a normal fashion and was symmetric.  The airway was stable and patent throughout the entire examination.  The nasal laryngoscope was then slowly withdrawn from the supraglottic region and the scope was further advanced into the oropharynx and nasopharynx.  The eustachian tube was completely visualized and was patent without obstruction.  The scope was then further removed without difficulty.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and remained in stable condition.
RECOMMENDATIONS AND PLAN:
The patient would benefit from Ocean nasal spray as well as bacitracin ointment applied to the anterior naris.  At this time, we were unable to discontinue the patient's inhaled steroids that she is using for her asthma.  If this becomes possible in the future, this may provide her some relief of her chronic dysphonia.  The patient is to follow up with Department of Otolaryngology after discharge from the hospital for further evaluation of these problems.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling?
[patient] i'm feeling okay, thank you.
[doctor] i just wanted to go over the results of your procedure. it looks like you had some atrophic dry nasal mucosa, which means the tissues lining your nasal passages are thin and dry. this can cause nosebleeds, which is why we cauterized the left nasal septum to stop the bleeding. we also did a fiberoptic nasal laryngoscopy and found some atrophic laryngeal changes likely caused by your inhaled steroid use for asthma.
[patient] okay, what does that mean for me?
[doctor] well, we recommend that you start using ocean nasal spray and apply bacitracin ointment to the anterior naris to help with the dryness and prevent further nosebleeds. unfortunately, we can't discontinue your inhaled steroids right now, but if that becomes possible in the future, it may help with your chronic dysphonia. we also recommend that you follow up with the department of otolaryngology after you're discharged from the hospital for further evaluation of these issues.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Cataract to right eye.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Cataract to right eye.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
Cataract extraction with intraocular lens implant of the right eye, anterior vitrectomy of the right eye.
LENS IMPLANT USED:
See below.
COMPLICATIONS:
Posterior capsular hole, vitreous prolapse.
ANESTHESIA:
Topical.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
The patient was identified in the preoperative holding area before being escorted back to the operating room suite.  Hemodynamic monitoring was begun.  Time-out was called and the patient eye operated upon and lens implant intended were verbally verified.  Three drops of tetracaine were applied to the operative eye.  The patient was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion for intraocular surgery.  A lid speculum was placed.  Two paracentesis sites were created approximately 120 degrees apart straddling the temple using a slit knife.  The anterior chamber was irrigated with a dilute 0.25% solution of non-preserved lidocaine and filled with Viscoat.  The clear corneal temporal incision was fashioned.  The anterior chamber was entered by introducing a keratome.  The continuous tear capsulorrhexis was performed using the bent needle cystotome and completed with Utrata forceps.  The cataractous lens was then hydrodissected and phacoemulsified using a modified phaco-chop technique.  Following removal of the last nuclear quadrant, there was noted to be a posterior capsular hole nasally.  This area was tamponaded with Healon.  The anterior chamber was swept with a cyclodialysis spatula and there was noted to be vitreous prolapse.  An anterior vitrectomy was then performed bimanually until the vitreous was cleared from the anterior chamber area.  The sulcus area of the lens was then inflated using Healon and a V9002 16.0 diopter intraocular lens was unfolded and centered in the sulcus area with haptic secured in the sulcus.  There was noted to be good support.  Miostat was injected into the anterior chamber and viscoelastic agent rinsed out of the eye with Miostat.  Gentle bimanual irrigation, aspiration was performed to remove remaining viscoelastic agents anteriorly.  The pupil was noted to constrict symmetrically.  Wounds were checked with Weck-cels and found to be free of vitreous.  BSS was used to re-inflate the anterior chamber to normal depth as confirmed by tactile pressure at about 12.  All corneal wounds were then hydrated, checked and found to be watertight and free of vitreous.  A single 10-0 nylon suture was placed temporarily as prophylaxis and the knot buried.  Lid speculum was removed.  TobraDex ointment, light patch and a Soft Shield were applied.  The patient was taken to the recovery room, awake and comfortable.  We will follow up in the morning for postoperative check.  He will not be given Diamox due to his sulfa allergy.  The intraoperative course was discussed with both he and his wife.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after your cataract surgery?
[patient] i'm doing okay, a bit uncomfortable but not in any pain.
[doctor] that's good to hear. we did find a posterior capsular hole and vitreous prolapse during the surgery, but we were able to address those issues. the procedure went well overall.
[patient] okay, what does that mean for my recovery?
[doctor] well, we placed a temporary suture as a precaution and you'll need to wear a light patch and a soft shield to protect the eye. we'll remove the suture in a follow-up appointment tomorrow and make sure the wound is healing properly. you'll also need to continue using tobradex ointment as directed.
[patient] alright. will i need any additional medication or treatment for the posterior capsular hole and vitreous prolapse?
[doctor] no, we were able to address those issues during the surgery and everything should heal properly with time. just make sure to follow all post-operative instructions and attend all follow-up appointments. and, we won't be giving you diamox due to your sulfa allergy.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Right carpal tunnel syndrome.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Right carpal tunnel syndrome.
PROCEDURE:
Right carpal tunnel release.
ANESTHESIA:
Bier block to the right hand.
TOTAL TOURNIQUET TIME:
20 minutes.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
DISPOSITION:
Stable to PACU.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
Less than 10 cc.
GROSS OPERATIVE FINDINGS:
We did find a compressed right median nerve upon entering the carpal tunnel, otherwise, the structures of the carpal canal are otherwise unremarkable.  No evidence of tumor was found.
BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 54-year-old female who was complaining of right hand numbness and tingling of the median distribution and has elected to undergo carpal tunnel surgery secondary to failure of conservative management.
PROCEDURE:
The patient was taken to the operative room and placed in the supine position.  The patient underwent a Bier block by the Department of Anesthesia on the upper extremity.  The upper extremity was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion and left free.  Attention was drawn then to the palm of the hand.  We did identify area of incision that we would make, which was located over the carpal tunnel.
Approximately, 1.5 cm incision was made using a #10 blade scalpel.  Dissection was carried through the skin and fascia over the palm down to the carpal tunnel taking care during dissection to avoid any branches of nerves.  Carpal tunnel was then entered and the rest of the transverse carpal ligament was incised sharply with a #10 scalpel.  We inspected the median nerve and found that it was flat and compressed from the transverse carpal ligament.  We found no evidence of tumor or space occupying lesion in the carpal tunnel.  We then irrigated copiously.  Tourniquet was taken down at that time and pressure was held.  There was no evidence of obvious bleeders.  We approximated the skin with nylon and placed a postoperative dressing with a volar splint.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  She was placed back in the gurney and taken to PACU.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the surgery?
[patient] i'm feeling okay, a little sore.
[doctor] that's normal. do you have any numbness or tingling in your right hand?
[patient] no, it feels a lot better actually.
[doctor] great, that's what we hoped for. we found a compressed right median nerve in the carpal tunnel and released it during the procedure. we didn't find any tumor or other issues. the total time for the surgery was about 20 minutes, and we estimated blood loss to be less than 10 cc. 
[patient] oh, okay. is there anything i need to do after the surgery?

"PROCEDURE:
Direct current cardioversion.
REASON FOR PROCEDURE:
Atrial fibrillation.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
The procedure was explained to the patient with risks and benefits including risk of stroke.  The patient understands as well as her husband.  The patient had already a transesophageal echocardiogram showing no left atrial appendage thrombus or thrombus in the left atrium.  There was spontaneous echocardiogram contrast noticed.  The patient was on anticoagulation with Lovenox, received already 3 mg of Versed and 25 mcg of fentanyl for the TEE followed by next 2 mg of Versed for total of 5 mg of Versed.  The pads applied in the anterior and posterior approach.  With synchronized biphasic waveform at 150 J, one shock was successful in restoring sinus rhythm.  The patient had some occasional PACs noticed with occasional sinus tachycardia.  The patient had no immediate post-procedure complications.  The rhythm was maintained and 12-lead EKG was requested.

"INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:
This is a 61-year-old, white male with onset of chest pain at 04: 30 this morning, with history of on and off chest discomfort over the past several days. CPK is already over 1000. There is ST elevation in leads II and aVF, as well as a Q wave. The chest pain is now gone, mild residual shortness of breath, no orthopnea. Cardiac monitor shows resolution of ST elevation lead III.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
Following sterile prep and drape of the right groin, installation of 1% Xylocaine anesthesia, the right common femoral artery was percutaneously entered and 6-French sheath inserted. ACT approximately 165 seconds on heparin. Borderline hypotension 250 mL fluid bolus given and nitroglycerin patch removed. Selective left and right coronary injections performed using Judkins coronary catheters with a 6-French pigtail catheter used to obtain left ventricular pressures and left ventriculography. Left pullback pressure. Sheath injection. Hemostasis obtained with a 6-French Angio-Seal device. He tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the Cardiac Step-Down Unit in stable condition.
HEMODYNAMIC DATA:
Left ventricular end diastolic pressure elevated post A-wave at 25 mm of Mercury with no aortic valve systolic gradient on pullback.
ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:
I. Left coronary artery: The left main coronary artery is unremarkable. The left anterior descending has 30 to 40% narrowing with tortuosity in its proximal portion, patent first septal perforator branch. The first diagonal branch is a 2 mm vessel with a 90% ostial stenosis. The second diagonal branch is unremarkable, as are the tiny distal diagonal branches. The intermediate branch is a small, normal vessel. The ostial non-dominant circumflex has some contrast thinning, but no stenosis, normal obtuse marginal branch, and small AV sulcus circumflex branch.
II. Right coronary artery: The right coronary artery is a large, dominant vessel which gives off large posterior descending and posterolateral left ventricular branches. There are luminal irregularities, less than 25%, within the proximal to mid vessel. Some contrast thinning is present in the distal RCA just before the bifurcation into posterior descending and posterolateral branches. A 25%, smooth narrowing at the origin of the posterior descending branch. Posterolateral branch is unremarkable and quite large, with secondary and tertiary branches.
III. Left ventriculogram: The left ventricle is normal in size. Ejection fraction estimated at 40 to 45%. No mitral regurgitation. Severe hypokinesis to akinesis is present in the posterobasal and posteromedial segments with normal anteroapical wall motion.
DISCUSSION:
Recent inferior myocardial infarction with only minor contrast thinning distal RCA remaining on coronary angiography with resolution of chest pain and ST segment elevation. Left coronary system has one hemodynamically significant stenosis (a 90% ostial stenosis at the first diagonal branch, which is a 2 mm vessel). Left ventricular function is reduced with ejection fraction 40 to 45% with inferior wall motion abnormality.
PLAN:
Medical treatment, including Plavix and nitrates, in addition to beta blocker, aspirin, and aggressive lipid reduction.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?
[patient] i'm feeling okay now, thank you.
[doctor] that's good to hear. so, you had chest pain this morning, and you've had some discomfort over the past few days?

[doctor] it means that your heart is not pumping as effectively as it should be. we estimated your ejection fraction to be between 40 to 45%.
[patient] is that bad?
[doctor] it's not ideal, but it's not terrible. we will need to start you on some medications to help with your heart function and also to lower your risk of complications. we'll start you on plavix and nitrates, as well as a beta blocker, aspirin, and aggressive lipid reduction.

"PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
1. Left heart catheterization with coronary angiography, vein graft angiography and left ventricular pressure measurement and angiography.
2. Right femoral selective angiogram.
3. Closure device the seal the femoral arteriotomy using an Angio-Seal.
INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:
The patient with known coronary atherosclerotic heart disease and multiple risk factors of coronary disease, who had her last coronary arteriogram performed in 2004. She has had complaints of progressive chest discomfort, and has ongoing risks including current smoking, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia to name a few. The decision was made to proceed on with percutaneous evaluation and possible intervention given her known disease and the possibility of disease progression.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
After informed consent was obtained, The patient was taken to cardiac catheterization lab where her procedure was performed. She was prepped and prepared on the table; after which, her right groin was locally anesthetized with 1% lidocaine. Then, a 6-French sheath was inserted into the right femoral artery over a standard 0.035 guide wire. Coronary angiography and left ventricular measurement and angiography were performed using a 6-French JL4 diagnostic catheter to image the left coronary artery. A 6-French JR4 diagnostic catheter to image the right groin and her artery and the saphenous vein graft conduit. Subsequently, a 6-French angled pigtail catheter was used to measure left ventricular pressures and to perform a power injection, a left ventriculogram at 8 mL per second for a total of 30 mL. At the conclusion of the diagnostic evaluation, the patient had selective arteriography of her right femoral artery, which showed the right femoral artery to be free of significant atherosclerotic plaque. Did have a normal bifurcation into the superficial femoral and profunda femoris arteries and to have an arteriotomy that was in the common femoral artery away from the bifurcation. As such, an initial attempt to advance a Perclose device failed to allow the device descend to _____ tract and into the appropriate position within the artery. As such, the Perclose was never deployed and was removed intact over the wire from the system. We then replaced this with a 6-French Angio-Seal which was used to seal the femoral arteriotomy with achievement of hemostasis. The patient was subsequently dispositioned back to the MAC Unit where she will complete her bedrest prior to her disposition to home.
HEMODYNAMIC DATA:
Opening aortic pressure 125/60, left ventricular pressure 108/4 with an end-diastolic pressure of 16. There was no significant gradient across the aortic valve on pullback from the left ventricle. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 55%. Mitral regurgitation was less than or equal to 1+. There was normal wall motion in the RAO projection.
CORONARY ANGIOGRAM:
The left main coronary artery had mild atherosclerotic plaque. The proximal LAD was 100% occluded. The left circumflex had mild diffuse atherosclerotic plaque. The obtuse marginal branch which operates as an OM-2 had a mid approximately 80% stenosis at a kink in the artery. This appears to be the area of a prior anastomosis, the saphenous vein graft to the OM. This is a very small-caliber vessel and is 1.5-mm in diameter at best. The right coronary artery is dominant. The native right coronary artery had mild proximal and mid atherosclerotic plaque. The distal right coronary artery has an approximate 40% stenosis. The posterior left ventricular branch has a proximal 50 to 60% stenosis. The proximal PDA has a 40 to 50% stenosis. The saphenous vein graft to the right PDA is widely patent. There was competitive flow noted between the native right coronary artery and the saphenous vein graft to the PDA. The runoff from the PDA is nice with the native proximal PDA and PLV disease as noted above. There is also some retrograde filling of the right coronary artery from the runoff of this graft. The saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending is widely patent. The LAD beyond the distal anastomosis is a relatively small-caliber vessel. There is some retrograde filling that allows some filling into a more proximal diagonal branch. The saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal was known to be occluded from the prior study in 2004. Overall, this study does not look markedly different than the procedure performed in 2004.
CONCLUSION:
100% proximal LAD mild left circumflex disease with an OM that is a small-caliber vessel with an 80% lesion at a kink that is no amenable to percutaneous intervention. The native right coronary artery has mild to moderate distal disease with moderate PLV and PDA disease. The saphenous vein graft to the OM is known to be 100% occluded. The saphenous vein graft to the PDA and the saphenous vein graft to the LAD are open. Normal left ventricular systolic function.
PLAN:
The plan will be for continued medical therapy and risk factor modification. Aggressive antihyperlipidemic and antihypertensive control. The patient's goal LDL will be at or below 70 with triglyceride level at or below 150, and it is very imperative that the patient stop smoking.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Coronary artery disease.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Coronary artery disease plus intimal calcification in the mid abdominal aorta without significant stenosis.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
LEFT HEART CATHETERIZATION WITH ANGIOGRAPHY AND MID ABDOMINAL AORTOGRAPHY:
Under local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine with premedication, a right groin preparation was done.  Using the percutaneous Seldinger technique via the right femoral artery, a left heart catheterization was performed.  Coronary arteriography was performed with 6-French performed coronary catheters.  We used a 6-French JR4 and JL4 catheters to take multiple cineangiograms of the right and left coronary arteries.  After using the JR4 6-French catheter, nitroglycerin was administered because of the possibility of ostial spasm, and following that, we used a 5-French JR4 catheter for additional cineangiograms of the right coronary artery.  A pigtail catheter was placed in the mid abdominal aorta and abdominal aortic injection was performed to rule out abdominal aortic aneurysm, as there was dense calcification in the mid abdominal aorta.
ANALYSIS OF PRESSURE DATA:
Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 5 mmHg.  On continuous tracing from the left ventricle to the ascending aorta, there is no gradient across the aortic valve.  The aortic pressures were normal.  Contours of intracardiac pressure were normal.
ANALYSIS OF ANGIOGRAMS:
Selective cineangiograms were obtained with injection of contrast to the left ventricle, coronary arteries, and mid abdominal aorta.  A pigtail catheter was introduced into the left ventricle and ventriculogram performed in right anterior oblique position.  The mitral valve is competent and demonstrates normal mobility.  The left ventricular cavity is normal in size with excellent contractility.  Aneurysmal dilatation and/or dyskinesia absent.  The aortic valve is tricuspid and normal mobility.  The ascending aorta appeared normal.
Pigtail catheter was introduced in the mid abdominal aorta and placed just above the renal arteries.  An abdominal aortic injection was performed.  Under fluoroscopy, we see heavy dense calcification of the mid abdominal aorta between the renal artery and the bifurcation.  There was some difficulty initially with maneuvering the wire pass that area and it was felt that might be a tight stenosis.  The abdominal aortogram reveals wide patency of that area with mild intimal irregularity.  There is a normal left renal artery, normal right renal artery.  The celiac seems to be normal, but what I believe is the splenic artery seen initially at its origin is normal.  The common left iliac and common right iliac arteries are essentially normal in this area.
CORONARY ANATOMY:
One notes ostial coronary calcification of the right coronary artery.  Cineangiogram obtained with 6-French JR4 and 5-French JR4 catheters.  Prior to the introduction of the 5-French JR4 nitroglycerin was administered sublingually.  The 6-French JR4 catheters appeared to a show an ostial lesion of over 50%.  There was backwash of dye into the aorta, although there is a fine funneling of the ostium towards the proximal right coronary artery.  In the proximal portion of the right coronary artery just into the Shepherd turn, there is a 50% smooth tapering of the right coronary artery in the proximal third.  Then the artery seems to have a little bit more normal size and it divides into a large posterior descending artery posterolateral branch vessel.  The distal portion of the vessel is free of disease.  The conus branch is seen arising right at the beginning part of the right coronary artery.  We then removed the 6-French catheter and following nitroglycerin and sublingually we placed a 5-French catheter and again finding a stenosis, may be less than 50%.  At the ostium of the right coronary artery, calcification again is identified.  Backwash of dye noted at the proximal lesion, looked about the same 50% along the proximal turn of the Shepherd turn area.
The left coronary artery is normal, although there is a rim of ostial calcification, but there is no tapering or stenosis.  It forms the left anterior descending artery, the ramus branch, and the circumflex artery.
The left anterior descending artery is a very large vessel, very tortuous in its proximal segment, very tortuous in its mid and distal segment.  There appears to be some mild stenosis of 10% in the proximal segment.  It gives off a large diagonal branch in the proximal portion of the left anterior descending artery and it is free of disease.  The remaining portion of the left anterior descending artery is free of disease.  Upon injection of the left coronary artery, we see what I believe is the dye enters probably directly into the left ventricle, but via fistula excluding the coronary sinus, and we get a ventriculogram performed.  I could not identify an isolated area, but it seems to be from the interventricular septal collaterals that this is taking place.
The ramus branch is normal and free of disease.
The left circumflex artery is a tortuous vessel over the lateral wall and terminating in the inferoposterior wall that is free of disease.
The patient has a predominantly right coronary system.  There is no _______ circulation connecting the right and left coronary systems.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The catheter was removed.  Hemostasis was achieved.  The patient was transferred to the recovery room in a stable condition.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Excellent left ventricular contractility with normal left ventricular cavity size.
2.  Calcification of the mid abdominal aorta with wide patency of all vessels.  The left and right renal arteries are normal.  The external iliac arteries are normal.
3.  Essentially normal left coronary artery with some type of interventricular septal to left ventricular fistula.
4.  Ostial stenosis of the right coronary artery that appears to be about 50% or greater.  The proximal right coronary artery has 50% stenosis as well.
5.  Coronary calcification is seen under fluoroscopy at the ostia of the left and right coronary arteries.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
The patient has heavy calcification of the coronary arteries and continued risk factor management is needed.  The ostial lesion of the right coronary artery may be severe.  It is at least 50%, but it could be worse.  Therefore, she will be evaluated for the possibility of an IVUS and/or _______ analysis of the proximal right coronary artery.  We will reevaluate her stress nuclear study as well.  Continue aggressive medical therapy.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm fine, thank you.
[doctor] so, we have the results of your left heart catheterization with angiography and mid abdominal aortography here. there's good news and bad news. the good news is that you have excellent left ventricular contractility with a normal left ventricular cavity size, which means your heart is pumping well. the bad news is that you have calcification of the mid abdominal aorta with some mild intimal irregularity, but wide patency of all vessels. the left and right renal arteries, and the external iliac arteries are normal. there's also some type of interventricular septal to left ventricular fistula.

"EXAM:
Left Heart Catheterization,REASON FOR EXAM:
Chest pain, coronary artery disease, prior bypass surgery.
INTERPRETATION:
The procedure and complications were explained to the patient in detail and formal consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the cath lab.  The right groin was draped in the usual sterile manner.  Using modified Seldinger technique, a 6-French arterial sheath was introduced in the right common femoral artery.  A JL4 catheter was used to cannulate the left coronary arteries.  A JR4 catheter was used to cannulate the right coronary artery and also bypass grafts.  The same catheter was used to cannulate the vein graft and also LIMA.  I tried to attempt to cannulate other graft with Williams posterior catheter and also bypass catheter was unsuccessful.  A 6-French pigtail catheter was used to perform left ventriculography and pullback was done.  No gradient was noted.  Arterial sheath was removed.  Hemostasis was obtained with manual compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure very well without any complications.
FINDINGS:
1.  Native coronary arteries.  The left main is patent.  The left anterior descending artery is not clearly visualized.  The circumflex artery appears to be patent.  The proximal segment gives rise to small caliber obtuse marginal vessel.
2.  Right coronary artery is patent with mild distal and mid segment.  No evidence of focal stenosis or dominant system.
3.  Bypass graft LIMA to the left anterior descending artery patent throughout the body as well the anastomotic site.  There appears to be possible _______ graft to the diagonal 1 vessel.  The distal LAD wraps around the apex.  No stenosis following the anastomotic site noted.
4.  Vein graft to what appears to be obtuse marginal vessel was patent with a small caliber obtuse marginal 1 vessel.
5.  No other bypass grafts are noted by left ventriculography and also aortic root shot.
6.  Left ventriculography with an ejection fraction of 60%.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Left coronary artery disease native.
2.  Patent vein graft with obtuse marginal vessel and also LIMA to LAD.  _______ graft to the diagonal 1 vessel.
3.  Native right coronary artery is patent, mild disease.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Medical treatment.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?

[patient] hello! i'm feeling okay, but a little discomfort in my right arm and neck.
[doctor] i see. so, you had some noninvasive imaging that showed a suspected right subclavian stenosis. the ultrasound confirmed at least a 50% stenosis. that's why we're going to perform an angiogram to get a better look at what's going on. 
[patient] okay, that makes sense.
[doctor] we'll be going in through your right groin to access the femoral artery. you'll be sedated with iv medication and given local anesthesia to numb the area. we'll be using a #6 french sheath to access the artery, and then a pigtail catheter will be advanced to the aortic arch to perform an angiogram.

"PROCEDURES PERFORMED:
1. Left heart catheterization with coronary angiography and left ventricular pressure measurement.
2. Left ventricular angiography was not performed.
3. Right posterior descending artery percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty followed by stenting.
4. Right femoral artery angiography.
5. Perclose to seal the right femoral arteriotomy.
INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:
Patient presenting with a history of coronary artery disease in the past with coronary angiography in the early 1990s. The patient presented with what appeared to be a COPD exacerbation and had mildly positive cardiac enzyme markers suggestive of a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. He was subsequently dispositioned to the cardiac catheterization lab for further evaluation.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization lab, where his procedure was performed. The patient was appropriately prepped and prepared on the table, after which his right groin was locally anesthetized with 1% lidocaine. Then, a 6-French sheath was inserted into the right femoral artery. Over a standard 0.035 guidewire, coronary angiography and left ventricular pressure measurements were performed using a 6-French JL4 diagnostic catheter to image the left coronary artery, a 6-French JR4 diagnostic catheter to image the right coronary artery, a 6-French angled pigtail catheter to measure left ventricular pressure. At the conclusion of the diagnostic study, the case was progressed to percutaneous coronary intervention, which will be described below. Subsequently, right femoral artery angiography was performed which showed right femoral artery which was free of significant atherosclerotic plaque, and an arteriotomy that was suitable for a closure device. Then, a Perclose was used to seal the right femoral arteriotomy.
HEMODYNAMIC DATA:
The opening aortic pressure was 91/63. The left ventricular pressure was 94/13 with an end-diastolic pressure of 24. Left ventricular ejection fraction was not assessed, as ventriculogram was not performed. The patient did have some elevated creatinine earlier in this hospital course which warranted limitation of contrast where possible.
CORONARY ANGIOGRAM:
The left main coronary artery was angiographically okay. The LAD had mild diffuse disease. There appeared to be distal tapering of the LAD. The left circumflex had mild diffuse disease. In the very distal aspect of the circumflex after OM-3 and OM-4 type branch, there was a long, severely diseased segment that appeared to be chronic and subtotal in one area. The runoff from this area appeared to be a very small PLOM type branch and continuation of a circ which did not appear to supply much territory, and there was not much to salvage by approaching this lesion. The right coronary artery had mild diffuse disease. The PLV branch was 100% occluded at its ostium at the crux. The PDA at the ostium had an 80% stenosis. The PDA was a fairly sizeable vessel with a long course. The right coronary is dominant.
CONCLUSION:
Mild diffuse coronary artery disease with severe distal left circumflex lesion with not much runoff beyond this lesion. This circumflex appears to be chronically diseased and has areas that appear to be subtotal. There is a 100% PLV branch which is also chronic and reported in his angiogram in the 1990s. There is an ostial 80% right PDA lesion. The plan is to proceed with percutaneous intervention to the right PDA.
The case was then progressed to percutaneous intervention of the right PDA. A 6-French JR4 guide catheter with side holes was selected and used to engage the right coronary artery ostium. The lesion was crossed with a long BMW 0.014 guidewire. Then, we ballooned the lesion with a 2.5 x 9 mm Maverick balloon. Subsequently, we stented the lesion with a 2.5 x 16 mm Taxus drug-eluting stent with a nice angiographic result. The patient tolerated the procedure very well, without complications.
ANGIOPLASTY CONCLUSION:
Successful percutaneous intervention with drug-eluting stent placement to the ostium of the PDA.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Aspirin indefinitely, and Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily for no less than six months. The patient will be dispositioned back to telemetry for further monitoring.
TOTAL MEDICATIONS DURING PROCEDURE:
Versed 1 mg and fentanyl 25 mcg for conscious sedation. Heparin 8400 units IV was given for anticoagulation. Ancef 1 g IV was given for closure device prophylaxis.
CONTRAST ADMINISTERED:
200 mL.
FLUOROSCOPY TIME:
12.4 minutes.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling?

"The patient and his wife had the opportunity to ask questions, all of which were answered for them and the patient stated in a clear, competent and coherent fashion that he wished to go forward with cardiac catheterization which I felt was appropriate.
PROCEDURE NOTE:
The patient was brought to the Cardiac Catheterization Lab in a fasting state.  All appropriate labs had been reviewed.  Bilateral groins were prepped and draped in the usual fashion for sterile conditions.  The appropriate time-out procedure was performed with appropriate identification of the patient, procedure, physician, position and documentation all done under my direct supervision and there were no safety issues raised by the staff.  He received a total of 2 mg of Versed and 50 mcg of Fentanyl utilizing titrated concentration with good effect.  Bilateral groins had been prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Right femoral inguinal fossa was anesthetized with 1% topical lidocaine and a 6-French vascular sheath was put into place percutaneously via guide-wire exchanger with a finder needle.  All catheters were passed using a J-tipped guide-wire.  Left heart catheterization and left ventriculography performed using a 6-French pigtail catheter.  Left system coronary angiography performed using a 6-French JL4 catheter.  Right system coronary angiography performed using a 6-French CDRC catheter.  Following the procedure, all catheters were removed.  Manual pressure was held with the Neptune pad and the patient was discharged back to his room.  I inspected the femoral arteriotomy site after the procedure was complete and it was benign without evidence of hematoma nor bruit with intact distal pulses.  There were no apparent complications.  A total of 77 cc of Isovue dye and 1.4 minutes of fluoroscopy time were utilized during the case.

[doctor] mm-hmm, good to hear that. so, i just want to go over the findings from the procedure with you. you've got some mild to moderate stenosis in your left main artery and a very severe mid-lad stenosis with severe mid-left circumflex stenosis and moderate prox-lad cad. based on these findings, i would recommend continuing your aspirin and beta blocker medication and adding a statin. so, we'll check your fasting lipid profile and alt and titrate statin therapy to keep your ldl under 70 mg/dl or less. how does that sound? 
[patient] alright, that sounds good. 
[doctor] great. i also want to let you know that during the procedure, we utilized a total of 77 cc of isovue dye and 1.4 minutes of fluoroscopy time. we prepped and draped your bilateral groins in a sterile fashion, and the procedure went smoothly without any complications. your femoral arteriotomy site looked good with no evidence of hematoma or bruit and intact distal pulses. 
[patient] um, thank you for explaining that to me. 
[doctor] of course. do you have any questions or concerns about the procedure or the findings? 
[patient] no, i think i understand everything. 
[doctor] alright then. please follow up with me in a few weeks for a re-evaluation.",2
"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Post infarct angina.
TYPE OF PROCEDURE:
Left cardiac catheterization with selective right and left coronary angiography.
PROCEDURE:
After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory, and the groin was prepped in the usual fashion.  Using 1% lidocaine, the right groin was infiltrated, and using the Seldinger technique, the right femoral artery was cannulated.  Through this, a moveable guidewire was then advance to the level of the diaphragm, and through it, a 6 French pigtail catheter was advanced under hemodynamic monitoring to the ascending aorta and inserted into the left ventricle.  Pressure measurements were obtained and cineangiograms in the RAO and LAO positions were then obtained.  Catheter was then withdrawn and a #6 French non-bleed-back sidearm sheath was then introduced, and through this, a 6 French Judkins left coronary catheter was then advanced under hemodynamic monitoring to the left coronary ostium, engaged.  Cineangiograms were obtained of the left coronary system.  This catheter was then exchanged for a Judkins right 4 coronary catheter of similar dimension and under hemodynamic monitoring again was advanced to the right coronary ostium, engaged.  Cineangiograms were obtained, and the catheter and sheath were then withdrawn.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory in stable condition.  No evidence of hematoma formation or active bleeding.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
TOTAL CONTRAST:
110 cc of Hexabrix.
TOTAL FLUOROSCOPY TIME:
1.8 minutes.
MEDICATIONS:
Reglan 10 mg p.o.
5 mg p.o.  Valium, Benadryl 50 mg p.o. and heparin 3,000 units IV push.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm okay, a bit sore though.
[doctor] that's understandable. you had a left cardiac catheterization with selective right and left coronary angiography procedure yesterday. can you tell me how it went?
[patient] yes, it went well. they prepped my groin area and used lidocaine to infiltrate the right groin. they then used the seldinger technique to cannulate the right femoral artery and inserted a catheter into the left ventricle. they obtained pressure measurements and cineangiograms in the rao and lao positions. then, they used a judkins left coronary catheter to look at the left coronary system and a judkins right 4 coronary catheter to examine the right coronary system. they used a contrast agent called hexabrix and i was given reglan, valium, benadryl, and heparin during the procedure. i don't think there were any complications.
[doctor] that's great to hear. were there any issues during the procedure or did you experience any discomfort?
[patient] no, everything went smoothly. i was under hemodynamic monitoring throughout the procedure and i was told i tolerated it well.
[doctor] that's reassuring. do you feel any pain or discomfort now?
[patient] yes, some soreness around the groin area where they inserted the catheter. but overall, it's not too bad.
[doctor] that's normal after a procedure like this. you can take over-the-counter pain medication to alleviate the pain. if there are no complications, you should be able to resume your normal activities soon. is there anything else i can help with?

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
Left calcaneal valgus split.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
Left calcaneal valgus split.
PROCEDURES:
1.  Left calcaneal lengthening osteotomy with allograft.
2.  Partial plantar fasciotomy.
3.  Posterior subtalar and tibiotalar capsulotomy.
4.  Short leg cast placed.
ANESTHESIA:
Surgery performed under general anesthesia.
TOURNIQUET TIME:
69 minutes.
The patient in local anesthetic of 20 mL of 0.25% Marcaine plain.
COMPLICATIONS:
No intraoperative complications.
DRAINS:
None.
SPECIMENS:
None.
HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:
The patient is a 13-year-old female who had previous bilateral feet correction at 1 year of age.  Since that time, the patient has developed significant calcaneal valgus deformity with significant pain.  Radiographs confirmed collapse of the spinal arch, as well as valgus position of the foot.  Given the patient's symptoms, surgery is recommended for calcaneal osteotomy and Achilles lengthening.  Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed with the mother.  Risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia; infection; bleeding; changes in sensation in most of extremity; hardware failure; need for later hardware removal; possible nonunion; possible failure to correct all the deformity; and need for other surgical procedures.  The patient will need to be strict nonweightbearing for at least 6 weeks and wear a brace for up to 6 months.  All questions were answered and parents agreed to the above surgical plan.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  A bump was placed underneath the left buttock.  A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the upper aspect of the left thigh.  The extremity was then prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion.  The patient had a previous incision along the calcaneocuboid lateral part of the foot.  This was marked and extended proximally through the Achilles tendon.  Extremity was wrapped in Esmarch.  Tourniquet inflation was noted to be 250 mmHg.  Decision was then made to protect the sural nerve.  There was one sensory nervous branch that did cross the field though it was subsequently sharply ligated because it was in the way.  Dissection was carried down to Achilles tendon, which was subsequently de-lengthened with the distal half performed down the lateral thigh.  Proximal end was tacked with an 0 Ethibond suture and subsequently repaired end-on-end at length with the heel in neutral.  Dissection was then carried on the lateral border of the foot with identification of the peroneal longus and valgus tendons, which were removed from the sheath and retracted dorsally.  At this time, we also noted that calcaneocuboid joint appeared to be fused.  The area between the anterior and middle facets were plicated on fluoroscopy for planned osteotomy.  This was performed with a saw.  After a partial plantar fasciotomy was performed, this was released off an abductor digiti minimi.  The osteotomy was completed with an osteotome and distracted with the lamina spreader.  A tricortical allograft was then shaped and subsequently impacted into this area.  Final positioning was checked with multiple views of fluoroscopy.  It was subsequently fixed using a 0.94 K-wire and drilled from the heel anteriorly.  A pin was subsequently bent and cut short at the level of the skin.  The wound was then irrigated with normal saline.  The Achilles was repaired with this tie.  Please note during the case, it was noted the patient had continued significant stiffness despite the Achilles lengthening.  A posterior capsulotomy of the tibiotalar and subtalar joints were performed with increased 10 degrees of dorsiflexion.  Wound was then closed using #2-0 Vicryl and #4-0 Monocryl.  The surgical field was irrigated with 0.25% Marcaine and subsequently injected with more Marcaine at the end of the case.  The wound was clean and dry and dressed with Steri-Strips and Xeroform.  Skin was dressed with Xeroform and 4 x 4's.  Everything was wrapped with 4 x 4's in sterile Webril.  The tourniquet was released after 69 minutes.  A short-leg cast was then placed with good return of capillary refill to his toes.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was subsequently taken to the recovery room in stable condition.
POSTOPERATIVE PLAN:
The patient will be hospitalized overnight for elevation, ice packs, neurovascular checks, and pain control.  The patient to be strict nonweightbearing.  We will arrange for her to get a wheelchair.  The patient will then follow up in about 10 to 14 days for a cast check, as well as pain control.  The patient will need an AFO script at that time.  Intraoperative findings are relayed to the parents.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after the surgery?

"INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:
A 51-year-old, obese, white female with positive family history of coronary disease and history of chest radiation for Hodgkin disease 20 years ago with no other identifiable risk factors who presents with an acute myocardial infarction with elevated enzymes. The chest pain occurred early Tuesday morning. She was treated with Plavix, Lovenox, etc.
and transferred for coronary angiography and possible PCI. The plan was discussed with the patient and all questions answered.
PROCEDURE NOTE:
Following sterile prep and drape, the right groin and instillation of 1% Xylocaine anesthesia, the right femoral artery was percutaneously entered with a single wall puncture. A 6-French sheath inserted. Selective left and right coronary injections performed using Judkins coronary catheters with a 6-French pigtail catheter used to obtain left ventricle pressures, and a left ventriculography. The left pullback pressure. The catheters withdrawn. Sheath injection. Hemostasis obtained with a 6-French Angio-Seal device. She tolerated the procedure well.
Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure equals 25 mmHg post A wave. No aortic valve or systolic gradient on pullback.
ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:
I. Left coronary artery: The left main coronary artery is,normal. The left anterior descending extends to the apex and has only minor luminal irregularities within the midportion of the vessel. Normal diagonal branches. Normal septal perforator branches. The left circumflex is a nondominant vessel with only minor irregularities with normal obtuse marginal branches.
II. Right coronary artery: The proximal right coronary artery has a focal calcification. There is minor plaque with luminal irregularity in the proximal and midportion of the vessel with no narrowing greater than 10 to 20% at most. The right coronary artery is a dominant system which gives off normal posterior,descending and posterior lateral branches. TIMI 3 flow is present.
III. Left ventriculogram: The left ventricle is slightly enlarged with normal contraction of the base, but, with wall motion abnormality involving the anteroapical and inferoapical left ventricle with hypokinesis within the apical portion. Ejection fraction estimated 40%, 1+ mitral regurgitation (echocardiogram ordered).
DISCUSSION:
Recent inferoapical mild myocardial infarction by left ventriculography and cardiac enzymes with elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure post A wave, but, only minor residual coronary artery plaque with calcification proximal right coronary artery.
PLAN:
Medical treatment is contemplated, including ACE inhibitor, a beta blocker, aspirin, Plavix, nitrates. An echocardiogram is ordered to exclude apical left ventricular thrombus and to further assess ejection fraction.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, doctor. i'm feeling better, thank you.
[doctor] good to hear that. i just wanted to discuss the results of your procedure with you. the angiography showed that your left anterior descending artery extends to the apex and has only minor luminal irregularities within the mid-portion of the vessel. your left circumflex is a nondominant vessel with only minor irregularities with normal obtuse marginal branches. the proximal right coronary artery has a focal calcification with minor plaque and luminal irregularity in the proximal and mid-portion of the vessel with no narrowing greater than 10 to 20% at most. your left ventricle is slightly enlarged with normal contraction of the base but has wall motion abnormality involving the anteroapical and inferoapical left ventricle with hypokinesis within the apical portion. your ejection fraction is estimated to be 40%, and there is 1+ mitral regurgitation.
[patient] okay, what does that mean?
[doctor] basically, you had a mild heart attack, but the good news is that your arteries have only minor irregularities, and there is a focal calcification in the proximal right coronary artery. we will start medical treatment, including an ace inhibitor, a beta-blocker, aspirin, plavix, and nitrates. we will also order an echocardiogram to exclude apical left ventricular thrombus and to further assess your ejection fraction.
[patient] okay, i understand. what should i do now?
[doctor] you should continue taking the medications we have prescribed and come back for regular follow-up appointments. if you experience any chest pain or discomfort, shortness of breath, or any other symptoms, please let us know immediately. we will also schedule the echocardiogram for you as soon as possible.
[patient] alright, i will do that.
[doctor] great. if you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to ask me anything.
[patient] thank you, doctor.","[doctor] hey, how's it going today?
[patient] um, hey doc. feeling better, mm-hmm.
[doctor] awesome, glad to hear it. just wanted to go over your results from the procedure. your angiography showed minor irregularities in your arteries, but nothing major. your left ventricle is slightly bigger, but still contracting normally at the base. there's some abnormal wall motion in the anteroapical and inferoapical regions and some mitral regurgitation. your ejection fraction is around 40%.
[patient] okay, gotcha. what does that mean?
[doctor] it means you had a mild heart attack, but your arteries are looking pretty good overall. we'll start you on some meds, including an ace inhibitor, a beta-blocker, aspirin, plavix, and nitrates. we'll also get an echocardiogram done to double-check everything.
[patient] ah, got it. what now?
[doctor] just keep taking your meds and come back for check-ups. if you have any chest pain or shortness of breath, give us a holler right away. we'll schedule your echocardiogram as soon as possible.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Medial meniscal tear, left knee.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Chondromalacia of medial femoral condyle.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
1.  Arthroscopy of the left knee.
2.  Left arthroscopic medial meniscoplasty of medial femoral condyle.
3.  Chondroplasty of the left knee as well.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
80 cc.
TOTAL TOURNIQUET TIME:
19 minutes.
DISPOSITION:
The patient was taken to PACU in stable condition.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with left knee pain for approximately two years secondary to hockey injury where he did have a prior MCL sprain.  He has had a positive symptomology of locking and pain since then.  He had no frank instability to it, however.
GROSS OPERATIVE FINDINGS:
We did find a tear to the medial meniscus as well as a large area of chondromalacia to the medial femoral condyle.
OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:
The patient was taken to the operating room.  The left lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Tourniquet was applied to the left thigh with adequate Webril padding, not inflated at this time.  After the left lower extremity had been prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion, we applied an Esmarch tourniquet, exsanguinating the blood and inflated the tourniquet to 325 mmHg for a total of 19 minutes.  We established the lateral port of the knee with #11 blade scalpel.  We put in the arthroscopic trocar, instilled with water and inserted the camera.
On inspection of the patellofemoral joint, it was found to be quite smooth.  Pictures were taken there.  There was no evidence of chondromalacia, cracking, or fissuring of the articular cartilage.  The patella was well centered over the trochlear notch.  We then directed the arthroscope to the medial compartment of the knee.  It was felt that there was a tear to the medial meniscus.  We also saw large area of chondromalacia with grade-IV changes to bone over the medial femoral condyle.  This area was debrided with forceps and the arthroscopic shaver.  The cartilage was also smoothened over the medial femoral condyle.  This was curetted after the medial meniscus had been trimmed.  We looked into the notch.  We saw the ACL appeared stable, saw attachments to tibial as well as the femoral insertion with some evidence of laxity, wear and tear.  Attention then was taken to the lateral compartment with some evidence of tear to the lateral meniscus and the arterial surface of both the tibia as well as the femur were pristine in the lateral compartment.  All instruments were removed.  All loose cartilaginous pieces were suctioned from the knee and water was suctioned at the end.  We removed all instruments.  Marcaine was injected into the portal sites.  We placed a sterile dressing and stockinet on the left lower extremity.  He was transferred to the gurney and taken to PACU in stable condition.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling?
[patient] i feel fine, thank you.
[doctor] good to hear. i wanted to go over the details of your knee surgery. we found a tear to the medial meniscus in the left knee as well as a large area of chondromalacia to the medial femoral condyle. during the surgery, we performed an arthroscopy of the left knee, followed by a left arthroscopic medial meniscoplasty of the medial femoral condyle, and a chondroplasty of the left knee as well.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Congenital myotonic muscular dystrophy with bilateral planovalgus feet.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Congenital myotonic muscular dystrophy with bilateral planovalgus feet.
PROCEDURE:
Bilateral Crawford subtalar arthrodesis with open Achilles Z-lengthening and bilateral long-leg cast.
ANESTHESIA:
Surgery performed under general anesthesia.  The patient received 6 mL of 0.25% Marcaine local anesthetic on each side.
TOURNIQUET TIME:
Tourniquet time was 53 minutes on the left and 45 minutes on the right.
COMPLICATIONS:
There were no intraoperative complications.
DRAINS:
None.
SPECIMENS:
None.
HARDWARE USED:
Staple 7/8 inch x1 on each side.
HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:
The patient is a 5-year-4-month-old male who presents for evaluation of feet.  He has been having significant feet pain with significant planovalgus deformity.  The patient was noted to have flexible vertical talus.  It was decided that the patient would benefit by subtalar arthrodesis, possible autograft, and Achilles lengthening.  This was explained to the mother in detail.  This is going to be a stabilizing measure and the patient will probably need additional surgery at a later day when his foot is more mature.  Risks of surgery include risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for other surgical procedures, need to be nonweightbearing for some time.  All questions were answered and the mother agreed to the above plan.
PROCEDURE NOTE:
The patient was taken to the operating room, placed supine on the operating room, general anesthesia was administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  Bilateral nonsterile tourniquets were placed on each thigh.  A bump was placed underneath the left buttock.  Both the extremities were then prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.  Attention was first turned towards the left side.  Intended incision was marked on the skin.  The ankle was taken through a range of motion with noted improvement in the reduction of the talocalcaneal alignment with the foot in plantar flexion on the lateral view.  The foot was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of tourniquet to 200 mmHg.  Incision was then made over the left lateral aspect of the hind foot to expose the talocalcaneal joint.  The sinus tarsi was then identified using a U-shaped flap to tack muscles, and periosteum was retracted distally.  Once the foot was reduced a Steinman pin was used to hold it in position.  This position was first checked on the fluoroscopy.  The 7/8th inch staple was then placed across the sinus tarsi to maintain the reduction.  This was also checked with fluoroscopy.  The incision was then extended posteriorly to allow for visualization of the Achilles, which was Z-lengthened with the release of the lateral distal half.  This was sutured using 2-0 Ethibond and that was also oversewn.  The wound was irrigated with normal saline.  The periosteal flap was sutured over the staple using 2-0 Vicryl.  Skin was closed using 2-0 Vicryl interrupted and then with 4-0 Monocryl.  The area was injected with 6 mL of 0.25% Marcaine local anesthetic.  The wound was cleaned and dried, dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, and 4 x 4s and Webril.  Tourniquet was released after 53 minutes.  The exact same procedure was repeated on the right side with no changes or complications.  Tourniquet time on the right side was 45 minutes.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Bilateral long-leg casts were then placed with the foot in neutral with some moulding of his medial plantar arch.  The patient was subsequently was taken to Recovery in stable condition.
POSTOPERATIVE PLAN:
The patient will be hospitalized overnight for pain as per parents' request.  The patient is to be strict nonweightbearing for at least 6 weeks.  He is to follow up in the next 10 days for a check.  We will plan of changing to short-leg casts in about 4 weeks postop.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling?
[patient] i am in pain, but i am okay.

"PREPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS:
Left leg claudication.
POSTPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS:
Left leg claudication.
OPERATION PERFORMED:
Aortogram with bilateral, segmental lower extremity run off.
ANESTHESIA:
Conscious sedation.
INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE:
The patient presents with lower extremity claudication.  She is a 68-year-old woman, who is very fearful of the aforementioned procedures.  Risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to her to include bleeding, infection, arterial trauma requiring surgery, access issues and recurrence.  She appears to understand and agrees to proceed.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
The patient was taken to the Angio Suite, placed in a supine position.  After adequate conscious sedation, both groins were prepped with Chloraseptic prep.  Cloth towels and paper drapes were placed.  Local anesthesia was administered in the common femoral artery and using ultrasound guidance, the common femoral artery was accessed.  Guidewire was threaded followed by a
4-French sheath.  Through the 4-French sheath a 4-French Omni flush catheter was placed.  The glidewire was removed and contrast administered to identify the level of the renal artery.  Using power injector an aortogram proceeded.
The catheter was then pulled down to the aortic bifurcation.  A timed run-off view of both legs was performed and due to a very abnormal and delayed run-off in the left, I opted to perform an angiogram of the left lower extremity with an isolated approach.  The catheter was pulled down to the aortic bifurcation and using a glidewire, I obtained access to the contralateral left external iliac artery.  The Omni flush catheter was advanced to the left distal external iliac artery.  The glidewire rather exchanged for an Amplatz stiff wire.  This was left in place and the 4-French sheath removed and replaced with a 6-French destination 45-cm sheath.  This was advanced into the proximal superficial femoral artery and an angiogram performed.  I identified a functionally occluded distal superficial femoral artery and after obtaining views of the run off made plans for angioplasty.
The patient was given 5000 units of heparin and this was allowed to circulate.  A glidewire was carefully advanced using Roadmapping techniques through the functionally occluded blood vessels.  A 4-mm x 4-cm angioplasty balloon was used to dilate the area in question.
Final views after dilatation revealed a dissection.  A search for a 5-mm stent was performed, but none of this was available.  For this reason, I used a 6-mm x 80-mm marked stent and placed this at the distal superficial femoral artery.  Post dilatation was performed with a 4-mm angioplasty balloon.  Further views of the left lower extremity showed irregular change in the popliteal artery.  No significant stenosis could be identified in the left popliteal artery and noninvasive scan.  For this reason, I chose not to treat any further areas in the left leg.
I then performed closure of the right femoral artery with a 6-French Angio-Seal device.  Attention was turned to the left femoral artery and local anesthesia administered.  Access was obtained with the ultrasound and the femoral artery identified.  Guidewire was threaded followed by a 4-French sheath.  This was immediately exchanged for the 6-French destination sheath after the glidewire was used to access the distal external iliac artery.  The glidewire was exchanged for the Amplatz stiff wire to place the destination sheath.  The destination was placed in the proximal superficial femoral artery and angiogram obtained.  Initial views had been obtained from the right femoral sheath before removal.
Views of the right superficial femoral artery demonstrated significant stenosis with accelerated velocities in the popliteal and superficial femoral artery.  For this reason, I performed the angioplasty of the superficial femoral artery using the 4-mm balloon.  A minimal dissection plane measuring less than 1 cm was identified at the proximal area of dilatation.  No further significant abnormality was identified.  To avoid placing a stent in the small vessel I left it alone and approached the popliteal artery.  A 3-mm balloon was chosen to dilate a 50 to 79% popliteal artery stenosis.  Reasonable use were obtained and possibly a 4-mm balloon could have been used.  However, due to her propensity for dissection I opted not to.  I then exchanged the glidewire for an O1 for Thruway guidewire using an exchange length.  This was placed into the left posterior tibial artery.  A 2-mm balloon was used to dilate the orifice of the posterior tibial artery.  I then moved the wire to the perineal artery and dilated the proximal aspect of this vessel.  Final images showed improved run-off to the right calf.  The destination sheath was pulled back into the left external iliac artery and an Angio-Seal deployed.
FINDINGS:
Aortogram demonstrates a dual right renal artery with the inferior renal artery supplying the lower one third of the right renal parenchyma.  No evidence of renal artery stenosis is noted bilaterally.  There is a single left renal artery.  The infrarenal aorta, both common iliac and the external iliac arteries are normal.  On the right, a superficial femoral artery is widely patent and normal proximally.  At the distal third of the thigh there is diffuse disease with moderate stenosis noted.  Moderate stenosis is also noted in the popliteal artery and single vessel run-off through the posterior tibial artery is noted.  The perineal artery is functionally occluded at the midcalf.  The dorsal pedal artery filled by collateral at the high ankle level.
On the left, the proximal superficial femoral artery is patent.  Again, at the distal third of the thigh, there is a functional occlusion of the superficial femoral artery with poor collateralization to the high popliteal artery.  This was successfully treated with angioplasty and a stent placement.  The popliteal artery is diffusely diseased without focal stenosis.  The tibioperoneal trunk is patent and the anterior tibial artery occluded at its orifice.
IMPRESSION,1.  Normal bilateral renal arteries with a small accessory right renal artery.
2.  Normal infrarenal aorta as well as normal bilateral common and external iliac arteries.
3.  The proximal right renal artery is normal with moderately severe stenosis in the superficial femoral popliteal and tibial arteries.  Successful angioplasty with reasonable results in the distal superficial femoral, popliteal and proximal posterior tibial artery as described.
4.  Normal proximal left superficial femoral artery with functional occlusion of the distal left superficial femoral artery successfully treated with angioplasty and stent placement.  Run-off to the left lower extremity is via a patent perineal and posterior tibial artery.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling?
[patient] hi, yes, i'm fine.
[doctor] we have performed the aortogram with bilateral, segmental lower extremity run-off to understand the reason for your left leg claudication. we found that you have moderate stenosis in the superficial femoral popliteal and tibial arteries of your right leg. we were able to successfully complete the procedure and improve the run-off to the right calf.
[patient] oh, i see. and what about my left leg?
[doctor] we found a functional occlusion of the distal left superficial femoral artery which we successfully treated with angioplasty and a stent placement. the run-off to your left lower extremity is via a patent perineal and posterior tibial artery.
[patient] okay, thank you for explaining that to me.
[doctor] no problem. please keep in mind that there are some risks involved with this procedure, including bleeding, infection, arterial trauma requiring surgery, access issues, and possible recurrence. however, there were no complications in your case.
[patient] i understand. thank you for your help.
[doctor] you're welcome. we will continue to monitor your progress and schedule a follow-up appointment to ensure that everything is healing properly.","[doctor] hey there, how you feeling?
[patient] hi, uh, yeah, i'm fine.
[doctor] so we ran a few tests to find out what was causing your left leg claudication. we found moderate stenosis in the superficial femoral popliteal and tibial arteries of your right leg. we were able to successfully complete the procedure and improve the run-off to the right calf.
[patient] oh, i see. and what about my left leg?
[doctor] we found a functional occlusion of the distal left superficial femoral artery which we successfully treated with angioplasty and a stent placement. the run-off to your left lower extremity is via a patent perineal and posterior tibial artery.

"INDICATION:
Acute coronary syndrome.
CONSENT FORM:
The procedure of cardiac catheterization/PCI risks included but not restricted to death, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, emergent open heart surgery, bleeding, hematoma, limb loss, renal failure requiring dialysis, blood loss, infection had been explained to him.  He understands.  All questions answered and is willing to sign consent.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
Selective coronary angiography of the right coronary artery, left main LAD, left circumflex artery, left ventricular catheterization, left ventricular angiography, angioplasty of totally occluded mid RCA, arthrectomy using 6-French catheter, stenting of the mid RCA, stenting of the proximal RCA, femoral angiography and Perclose hemostasis.
NARRATIVE:
The patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization laboratory in a fasting state.  Both groins were draped and sterilized in the usual fashion.  Local anesthesia was achieved with 2% lidocaine to the right groin area and a #6-French femoral sheath was inserted via modified Seldinger technique in the right common femoral artery.  Selective coronary angiography was performed with #6 French JL4 catheter for the left coronary system and a #6 French JR4 catheter of the right coronary artery.  Left ventricular catheterization and angiography was performed at the end of the procedure with a #6-French angle pigtail catheter.
FINDINGS,1.  Hemodynamics systemic blood pressure 140/70 mmHg.  LVEDP at the end of the procedure was 13 mmHg.
2.  The left main coronary artery is a large with mild diffuse disease in the distal third resulting in less than 20% angiographic stenosis at the take off of the left circumflex artery.  The left circumflex artery is a large caliber vessel with diffuse disease in the ostium of the proximal segment resulting in less than 30% angiographic stenosis.  The left circumflex artery gives rise to a high small obtuse marginal branch that has high moderate-to-severe ostium.  The rest of the left circumflex artery has mild diffuse disease and it gives rise to a second large obtuse marginal branch that bifurcates into an upper and lower trunk.
The LAD is calcified and diffusely disease in the proximal and mid portion.  There is mild nonobstructive disease in the proximal LAD resulting in less than 20% angiographic stenosis.
3.  The right coronary artery is dominant.  It is septal to be occluded in the mid portion.
The findings were discussed with the patient and she opted for PCI.  Angiomax bolus was started.  The ACT was checked.  It was higher in 300.  I have given the patient 600 mg of oral Plavix.
The right coronary artery was engaged using a #6-French JR4 guide catheter.  I was unable to cross through this lesion using a BMW wire and a 3.0x8 mm balloon support.  I was unable to cross with this lesion using a whisper wire.  I was unable to cross with this lesion using Cross-IT 100 wire.  I have also used second #6-French Amplatz right I guide catheter.  At one time, I have lost flow in the distal vessel.  The patient experienced severe chest pain, ST-segment elevation, bradycardia, and hypotension, which responded to intravenous fluids and atropine along with intravenous dopamine.
Dr. X was notified.
Eventually, an Asahi grand slam wire using the same 3.0 x 8 mm Voyager balloon support, I was able to cross into the distal vessel.  I have performed careful balloon angioplasty of the mid RCA.  I have given nitroglycerin under the nursing several times during the procedure.
I then performed arthrectomy using #5-French export catheter.
I performed more balloon predilation using a 3.0 x16 mm Voyager balloon.  I then deployed 4.0 x15 mm, excised, and across the mid RCA at 18 atmospheres with good angiographic result.  Proximal to the proximal edge of the stent, there was still some persistent haziness most likely just diseased artery/diffuse plaquing.  I decided to cover this segment using a second 4.0 x 15 mm, excised, and two stents were overlapped, the overlap was postdilated using the same stent delivery balloon at high pressure with excellent angiographic result.
Left ventricular catheterization was performed with #6-French angle pigtail catheter.  The left ventricle is rather smaller in size.  The mid inferior wall is minimally hypokinetic, ejection fraction is 70%.  There is no evidence of aortic wall stenosis or mitral regurgitation.
Femoral angiography revealed that the entry point was above the bifurcation of the right common femoral artery and I have performed this as Perclose hemostasis.
CONCLUSIONS,1.  Normal left ventricular size and function.  Ejection fraction is 65% to 70%.  No MR.
2.  Successful angioplasty and stenting of the subtotally closed mid RCA.  This was hard, organized thrombus, very difficult to penetrate.  I have deployed two overlapping 4.0 x15 mm excised and with excellent angiographic result.  The RCA is dominant.
3.  No moderate disease in the distal left main.  Moderate disease in the ostium of the left circumflex artery.  Mild disease in the proximal LAD.
PLAN:
Recommend smoking cessation.  Continue aspirin lifelong and continue Plavix for at least 12 months.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling now?
[patient] i'm fine, doctor. a bit tired, but alright.
[doctor] okay, great. so, we have performed a procedure called cardiac catheterization/pci on you. i hope everything went well. before we begin, let me ask you, have you eaten anything in the last few hours?
[patient] no, i have been fasting.
[doctor] excellent, that's what we needed. so, we performed selective coronary angiography of the right coronary artery, left main lad, left circumflex artery, left ventricular catheterization, left ventricular angiography, angioplasty of totally occluded mid rca, arthrectomy using a 6-french catheter, stenting of the mid rca, stenting of the proximal rca, femoral angiography, and perclose hemostasis. 
[patient] okay. what does all that mean?
[doctor] we conducted several tests and procedures to check your heart's condition. we found out that your left main coronary artery is slightly affected in the distal third, resulting in less than 20% angiographic stenosis at the takeoff of the left circumflex artery. your left circumflex artery has moderate disease in the ostium of the proximal segment, resulting in less than 30% angiographic stenosis. the lad has mild nonobstructive disease in the proximal part, resulting in less than 20% angiographic stenosis. the right coronary artery is dominant, but it was septal in the mid-portion.
[patient] i see. what did you do after that?
[doctor] we talked to you about the available options, and you decided to opt for pci. we used a few techniques, such as angiomax bolus, act checking, and oral plavix administration. we then performed a careful balloon angioplasty of the mid rca and used arthrectomy with an export catheter. i then deployed two overlapping stents, which provided excellent angiographic results. we also conducted left ventricular catheterization, which showed no evidence of aortic wall stenosis or mitral regurgitation. we ended the procedure with femoral angiography and perclose hemostasis.
[patient] okay, and what are the conclusions?
[doctor] we found out that you have normal left ventricular size and function, with an ejection fraction of 65% to 70%, and no mr. we also performed successful angioplasty and stenting of the subtotally closed mid rca, which was quite difficult because of organized thrombus. there is moderate disease in the ostium of the left circumflex artery, and mild disease in the proximal lad. we recommend you to quit smoking and continue taking aspirin lifelong and plavix for at least 12 months.
[patient] alright, i understand. thank you, doctor. 
[doctor] you're welcome. if you feel any discomfort or have any questions, don't hesitate to contact us.","[doctor] hey there, how are you feeling now?

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Chronic hypertrophic adenotonsillitis.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Chronic hypertrophic adenotonsillitis.
OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:
Adenotonsillectomy, primary, patient under age 12.
ANESTHESIA:
General endotracheal anesthesia.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
This patient was brought from the holding area and did receive preoperative antibiotics of Cleocin as well as IV Decadron.  She was placed supine on the operating room table.  General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without difficulty.  In the holding area, her allergies were reviewed.  It is unclear whether she is actually allergic to penicillin.  Codeine caused her to be excitable, but she did not actually have an allergic reaction to codeine.  She might be allergic to BACTRIM and SULFA.  After positioning a small shoulder roll and draping sterilely, McIvor mouthgag, #3 blade was inserted and suspended from the Mayo stand.  There was no bifid uvula or submucous cleft.  She had 3+ cryptic tonsils with significant debris in the tonsillar crypts.  Injection at each peritonsillar area with 0.25% with Marcaine with 1:200,000 Epinephrine, approximately 1.5 mL total volume.  The left superior tonsillar pole was then grasped with curved Allis forceps.  _______ incision and dissection in the tonsillar capsule and hemostasis and removal of the tonsil was obtained with Coblation Evac Xtra Wand on 7/3.  Mouthgag was released, reopened, no bleeding was seen.  The right tonsil was then removed in the same fashion.  The mouthgag released, reopened, and no bleeding was seen.  Small red rubber catheter in the nasal passage was used to retract the soft palate.  She had mild-to-moderate adenoidal tissue residual.  It was removed with Coblation Evac Xtra gently curved Wand on 9/5.  Red rubber catheter was then removed.  Mouthgag was again released, reopened, no bleeding was seen.  Orogastric suction carried out with only scant clear stomach contents.  Mouthgag was then removed.  Teeth and lips were inspected and were in their preoperative condition.  The patient then awakened, extubated, and taken to recovery room in good condition.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Idiopathic toe walker.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Idiopathic toe walker.
PROCEDURE:
Bilateral open Achilles lengthening with placement of short leg walking cast.
ANESTHESIA:
Surgery performed under general anesthesia.  A total of 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine local anesthetic was used.
COMPLICATIONS:
No intraoperative complications.
DRAINS:
None.
SPECIMENS:
None.
TOURNIQUET TIME:
On the left side was 30 minutes, on the right was 21 minutes.
HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:
The patient is a 10-year-old boy who has been a toe walker since he started ambulating at about a year.  The patient had some mild hamstring tightness with his popliteal angle of approximately 20 degrees bilaterally.  He does not walk with a crouched gait but does toe walk.  Given his tightness, surgery versus observation was recommended to the family.  Family however wanted to correct his toe walking.  Surgery was then discussed.  Risks of surgery include risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremities, failure to resolve toe walking, possible stiffness, cast, and cast problems.  All questions were answered and parents agreed to above surgical plan.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  The patient was then subsequently placed prone with all bony prominences padded.  Two bilateral nonsterile tourniquets were placed on each thigh.  Both extremities were then prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion.  We turned our attention first towards the left side.  A planned incision of 1 cm medial to the Achilles tendon was marked on the skin.  The extremity was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of tourniquet to 250 mmHg.  Incision was then made and carried down through subcutaneous fat down to the tendon sheath.  Achilles tendon was identified and Z-lengthening was done with the medial distal half cut.  Once Z-lengthening was completed proximally, the length of the Achilles tendon was then checked.  This was trimmed to obtain an end-on-end repair with 0 Ethibond suture.  This was also oversewn.  Wound was then irrigated.  Achilles tendon sheath was reapproximated using 2-0 Vicryl as well as the subcutaneous fat.  The skin was closed using 4-0 Monocryl.  Once the wound was cleaned and dried and dressed with Steri-Strips and Xeroform, the area was injected with 0.5% Marcaine.  It was then dressed with 4 x 4 and Webril.  Tourniquet was released at 30 minutes.  The same procedure was repeated on the right side with tourniquet time of 21 minutes.  While the patient was still prone, two short-leg walking casts were then placed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was subsequently flipped supine on to hospital gurney and taken to PACU in stable condition.
POSTOPERATIVE PLAN:
The patient will be discharged on the day of surgery.  He may weightbear as tolerated in his cast, which he will have for about 4 to 6 weeks.  He is to follow up in approximately 10 days for recheck as well as prescription for intended AFOs, which he will need up to 6 months.  The patient may or may not need physical therapy while his Achilles lengthenings are healing.  The patient is not to participate in any PE for at least 6 months.  The patient is given Tylenol No. 3 for pain.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after your surgery?
[patient] hi, i'm feeling okay, a little sore.
[doctor] that's normal after surgery, especially with the procedure you had. i wanted to go over some details about your surgery and what to expect during your recovery.
[patient] sure, please do.
[doctor] so, you had a bilateral open achilles lengthening with placement of short leg walking casts. this was done to help with your idiopathic toe walking, which you've had since you started walking at around a year old. the surgery was done under general anesthesia, and there were no complications during the surgery. you were given some local anesthesia during the procedure as well.
[patient] okay, i remember some of that.
[doctor] good. your postoperative diagnosis is still idiopathic toe walker, but we're hoping that this surgery will help with that. you'll have the short leg walking casts on for about 4 to 6 weeks and can weight bear as tolerated. you'll need to follow up with me in about 10 days to check on the healing progress and get a prescription for the intended afos, which you'll need for up to 6 months. you might need physical therapy during the healing process as well.
[patient] okay, i'll make sure to do that. what about pain management?
[doctor] you can take tylenol no. 3 for pain, and we can adjust that as needed. you should avoid any physical education for at least 6 months to allow for proper healing.
[patient] got it. thank you for explaining everything to me.
[doctor] of course, if you have any questions or concerns during your recovery, don't hesitate to reach out to me.","[doctor] mm-hmm, you can weight bear as tolerated, but make sure to take it easy and don't push yourself too hard.
[patient] uh, yeah, i'll try to be careful. and, i'll need to see you in 10 days, right?
[doctor] that's right. we'll check on your healing progress and see how you're doing. and don't forget to get your prescription for the afos.
[patient] okay, i'll make sure to do that. thank you, doctor.",2
"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Achilles tendon rupture, left lower extremity.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Achilles tendon rupture, left lower extremity.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
Primary repair left Achilles tendon.
ANESTHESIA:
General.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
Minimal.
TOTAL TOURNIQUET TIME:
40 minutes at 325 mmHg.
POSITION:
Prone.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 26-year-old African-American male who states that he was stepping off a hilo at work when he felt a sudden pop in the posterior aspect of his left leg.  The patient was placed in posterior splint and followed up at ABC orthopedics for further care.
PROCEDURE:
After all potential complications, risks, as well as anticipated benefits of the above-named procedure were discussed at length with the patient, informed consent was obtained.  The operative extremity was then confirmed with the patient, the operative surgeon, Department Of Anesthesia, and nursing staff.  While in this hospital, the Department Of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic to the patient.  The patient was then transferred to the operative table and placed in the prone position.  All bony prominences were well padded at this time.
A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the left upper thigh of the patient, but not inflated at this time.  Left lower extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Once this was done, the left lower extremity was elevated and exsanguinated using an Esmarch and the tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg and kept up for a total of 40 minutes.  After all bony and soft tissue land marks were identified, a 6 cm longitudinal incision was made paramedial to the Achilles tendon from its insertion proximal.  Careful dissection was then taken down to the level of the peritenon.  Once this was reached, full thickness flaps were performed medially and laterally.  Next, retractor was placed.  All neurovascular structures were protected.  A longitudinal incision was then made in the peritenon and opened up exposing the tendon.  There was noted to be complete rupture of the tendon approximately 4 cm proximal to the insertion point.  The plantar tendon was noted to be intact.  The tendon was debrided at this time of hematoma as well as frayed tendon.  Wound was copiously irrigated and dried.  Most of the ankle appeared that there was sufficient tendon links in order to do a primary repair.  Next #0 PDS on a taper needle was selected and a Krackow stitch was then performed.  Two sutures were then used and tied individually ________ from the tendon.  The tendon came together very well and with a tight connection.  Next, a #2-0 Vicryl suture was then used to close the peritenon over the Achilles tendon.  The wound was once again copiously irrigated and dried.  A #2-0 Vicryl sutures were then used to close the skin and subcutaneous fashion followed by #4-0 suture in the subcuticular closure on the skin.  Steri-Strips were then placed over the wound and the sterile dressing was applied consisting of 4x4s, Kerlix roll, sterile Kerlix and a short length fiberglass cast in a plantar position.  At this time, the Department of anesthesia reversed the anesthetic.  The patient was transferred back to hospital gurney to the Postanesthesia Care Unit.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after the surgery?
[patient] hi doctor, i'm feeling okay, a little groggy from the anesthesia still.
[doctor] that's normal. can you tell me a little bit about what happened with your left achilles tendon?
[patient] well, i was stepping off a hilo at work and i felt a sudden pop in the posterior aspect of my left leg. i went to abc orthopedics and they recommended the surgery.
[doctor] yes, that's right. we performed a primary repair on your left achilles tendon under general anesthesia. the procedure went smoothly and we were able to repair the complete rupture of the tendon approximately 4 cm proximal to the insertion point.
[patient] that's good to hear. will i have to wear this cast for long?
[doctor] you'll need to wear the fiberglass cast for a few weeks to allow the tendon to heal properly. we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to remove the cast and check on your progress. in the meantime, it's important that you keep the cast clean and dry and avoid putting weight on your left foot.
[patient] okay, i'll make sure to take care of it. thank you, doctor.
[doctor] you're welcome. if you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to me or our office.","[doctor] hey there, how are you feeling after the surgery?

[patient] alright, got it. i'll make sure to take care of it. thank you, doctor.
[doctor] you're welcome. if you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to me or our office.",2
"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Right AC separation.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Right AC separation.
PROCEDURES:
Removal of the hardware and revision of right AC separation.
ANESTHESIA:
General.
BLOOD LOSS:
100 cc.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
FINDINGS:
Loose hardware with superior translation of the clavicle implants.
IMPLANTS:
Arthrex bioabsorbable tenodesis screws.
SUMMARY:
After informed consent was obtained and verified, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  After uneventful general anesthesia was obtained, he was positioned in the beach chair and his right shoulder was sterilely prepped and draped in a normal fashion.  The incision was reopened and the hardware was removed without difficulty.  The AC joint was inspected and reduced.  An allograft was used to recreate the coracoacromial ligaments and then secured to decorticate with a bioabsorbable tenodesis screw and then to the clavicle.  And two separate areas that were split, one taken medially and one taken laterally, and then sewed together for further stability.  This provided good stability with no further superior translation of the clavicle as viewed under fluoroscopy.  The wound was copiously irrigated and the wound was closed in layers and a soft dressing was applied.  He was awakened from anesthesia and taken to recovery room in a stable condition.
Final needle and instrument counts were correct.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?

"SUBJECTIVE:
This patient presents to the office today with his mom for checkup.  He used to live in the city.  He used to go to college down in the city.  He got addicted to drugs.  He decided it would be a good idea to get away from the ""bad crowd"" and come up and live with his mom.  He has a history of doing heroin.  He was injecting into his vein.  He was seeing a physician in the city.  They were prescribing methadone for some time.  He says that did help.  He was on 10 mg of methadone.  He was on it for three to four months.  He tried to wean down on the methadone a couple of different times, but failed.  He has been intermittently using heroin.  He says one of the big problems is that he lives in a household full of drug users and he could not get away from it.  All that changed now that he is living with his mom.  The last time he did heroin was about seven to eight days ago.  He has not had any methadone in about a week either.  He is coming in today specifically requesting methadone.  He also admits to being depressed.  He is sad a lot and down.  He does not have much energy.  He does not have the enthusiasm.  He denies any suicidal or homicidal ideations at the present time.  I questioned him on the symptoms of bipolar disorder and he does not seem to have those symptoms.  His past medical history is significant for no medical problems.  Surgical history, he voluntarily donated his left kidney.  Family and social history were reviewed per the nursing notes.  His allergies are no known drug allergies.  Medications, he takes no medications regularly.
OBJECTIVE:
His weight is 164 pounds, blood pressure 108/60, pulse 88, respirations 16, and temperature was not taken.  General:  He is nontoxic and in no acute distress.  Psychiatric:  Alert and oriented times 3.  Skin:  I examined his upper extremities.  He showed me his injection sites.  I can see marks, but they seem to be healing up nicely.  I do not see any evidence of cellulitis.  There is no evidence of necrotizing fasciitis.
ASSESSMENT:
Substance abuse.
PLAN:
I had a long talk with the patient and his mom.  I am not prescribing him any narcotics or controlled substances.  I am not in the practice of trading one addiction for another.  It has been one week without any sort of drugs at all.  I do not think he needs weaning.  I think right now it is mostly psychological, although there still could be some residual physical addiction.  However, once again I do not believe it to be necessary to prescribe him any sort of controlled substance at the present time.  I do believe that his depression needs to be treated.  I gave him fluoxetine 20 mg one tablet daily.  I discussed the side effects in detail.  I did also warn him that all antidepressant medications carry an increased risk of suicide.  If he should start to feel any of these symptoms, he should call #911 or go to the emergency room immediately.  If he has any problems or side effects, he was also directed to call me here at the office.  After-hours, he can go to the emergency room or call #911.  I am going to see him back in three weeks for the depression.  I gave him the name and phone number of Behavioral Health and I told him to call so that he can get into rehabilitation program or at least a support group.  We are unable to make a referral for him to do that.  He has to call on his own.  He has no insurance.  However, I think fluoxetine is very affordable.  He can get it for $4 per month at Wal-Mart.  His mom is going to keep an eye on him as well.  He is going to be staying there.  It sounds like he is looking for a job.","[doctor] hi, i'm dr. smith. what brings you in today?
[patient] hi, i've been struggling with addiction and depression, and i was hoping to get some help.
[doctor] i see. can you tell me a little bit more about your addiction history?

[doctor] i understand. it's good that you're seeking help. do you have any physical symptoms of withdrawal currently?
[patient] not really, just some residual addiction.
[doctor] okay, i'm not going to prescribe any controlled substance at this time. i think it's important to focus on your mental health as well. you mentioned feeling depressed- can you tell me more about that?
[patient] yeah, i've been feeling really down and don't have much energy or enthusiasm.

[patient] okay, thank you. will the fluoxetine interact with any of my previous drug use?
[doctor] no, it shouldn't. it's important to stay away from drugs and alcohol while taking it, though. i'm going to see you back in three weeks to check on your progress with the depression. is there anything else you'd like to discuss today?
[patient] no, that's all. thank you for your help.

"HISTORY:
A 59-year-old male presents in followup after being evaluated and treated as an in-patient by Dr. X for acute supraglottitis with airway obstruction and parapharyngeal cellulitis and peritonsillar cellulitis, admitted on 05/23/2008, discharged on 05/24/2008.  Please refer to chart for history and physical and review of systems and medical record.
PROCEDURES PERFORMED:
Fiberoptic laryngoscopy identifying about 30% positive Muller maneuver.  No supraglottic edema; +2/4 tonsils with small tonsil cyst, mid tonsil, left.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Resolving acute supraglottic edema secondary to pharyngitis and tonsillar cellulitis.
2.  Possible obstructive sleep apnea; however, the patient describes no known history of this phenomenon.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  History of anxiety.
5.  History of coronary artery disease.
6.  Hypertension.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Recommend continuing on Augmentin and tapered prednisone as prescribed by Dr. X.  Cultures are still pending and follow up with Dr. X in the next few weeks for re-evaluation.  I did discuss with the patient whether or not a sleep study would be beneficial and the patient denies any history of obstructive sleep apnea and wishes not to pursue this, but we will leave this open for him to talk with Dr. X on his followup, and he will pay more attention on his sleep pattern.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?

[doctor] good to know. during the physical examination, fiberoptic laryngoscopy was performed, and it showed that there is no supraglottic edema. however, the test did identify about 30% positive muller maneuver. this suggests possible obstructive sleep apnea. have you ever experienced any symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea?
[patient] no, i haven't, uh.
[doctor] alright. well, we will keep that in mind and monitor it closely. on another note, i noticed that you have hypercholesterolemia, a history of anxiety, coronary artery disease, and hypertension. how are you managing these conditions?
[patient] i'm taking my medication as prescribed and trying to live a healthy lifestyle, uh.
[doctor] great. it's important to stay on top of your medications and to maintain a healthy lifestyle. speaking of which, have you noticed any changes in your sleeping patterns since your hospitalization?
[patient] not really, i've been sleeping normally, um.
[doctor] okay, that's good to hear. i did discuss with you the possibility of a sleep study, but you declined. however, i encourage you to bring it up with dr. x during your follow-up appointment. we want to make sure that we are keeping an eye on your overall health.
[patient] i understand. thank you for your concern, uh.
[doctor] of course, it's my pleasure. keep taking your medication as prescribed, and we'll see you at your follow-up appointment, um.",2

He is a 24-year-old male who said that he had gotten into some poison ivy this weekend while he was fishing.  He has had several cases of this in the past and he says that is usually takes quite awhile for him to get over it; he said that the last time he was here he got a steroid injection by Dr. Blackman; it looked like it was Depo-Medrol 80 mg.  He said that it worked fairly well, although it seemed to still take awhile to get rid of it.  He has been using over-the-counter Benadryl as well as cortisone cream on the areas of the rash and having a little bit of improvement, but this last weekend he must have gotten into some more poison ivy because he has got another outbreak along his chest, legs, arms and back.
OBJECTIVE:
Vitals:  Temperature is 99.2.  His weight is 207 pounds.
Skin:  Examination reveals a raised, maculopapular rash in kind of a linear pattern over his arms, legs and chest area which are consistent with a poison ivy or a poison oak.
ASSESSMENT AND
PLAN:
Poison ivy.  Plan would be Solu-Medrol 125 mg IM X 1.  Continue over-the-counter Benadryl or Rx allergy medicine that he was given the last time he was here, which is a one-a-day allergy medicine; he can not exactly remember what it is, which would also be fine rather than the over-the-counter Benadryl if he would like to use that instead.","[doctor] hey there, how are you feeling?
[patient] hi, i'm not doing too well. i've got a rash from some poison ivy i got this weekend while i was fishing.
[doctor] alright, let's take a look. so you've had this before?
[patient] yes, several times. it usually takes me a while to get over it. i actually got a steroid injection the last time i was here from dr. blackman.
[doctor] okay, i see that in your chart. it looks like depo-medrol 80 mg. did that help?
[patient] it did, but it still took a while to completely go away. i've been using benadryl and cortisone cream, but this weekend it came back again on my chest, legs, arms, and back.
[doctor] i see. let me take a look at the rash. okay, i agree that it looks like poison ivy. your temperature is a little elevated, but nothing to be worried about. i'm going to prescribe solu-medrol 125 mg im for you. you can also continue using the over-the-counter benadryl, or if you remember the name of the one-a-day allergy medicine that you were given last time, you can use that instead.
[patient] okay, thank you.
[doctor] no problem. just make sure to take it easy and avoid any further exposure to poison ivy. if you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to give us a call.","[doctor] hey there, how are you feeling?

"SUBJECTIVE:
This patient presents to the office today because he has not been feeling well.  He was in for a complete physical on 05/02/2008.  According to the chart, the patient gives a history of feeling bad for about two weeks.  At first he thought it was stress and anxiety and then he became worried it was something else.  He says he is having a lot of palpitations.  He gets a fluttering feeling in his chest.  He has been very tired over two weeks as well.  His job has been really getting to him.  He has been feeling nervous and anxious.  It seems like when he is feeling stressed he has more palpitations, sometimes they cause chest pain.  These symptoms are not triggered by exertion.  He had similar symptoms about 9 or 10 years ago.  At that time he went through a full workup.  Everything ended up being negative and they gave him something that he took for his nerves and he says that helped.  Unfortunately, he does not remember what it was.  Also over the last three days he has had some intestinal problems.  He has had some intermittent nausea and his stools have been loose.  He has been having some really funny green color to his bowel movements.  There has been no blood in the stool.  He is not having any abdominal pain, just some nausea.  He does not have much of an appetite.  He is a nonsmoker.
OBJECTIVE:
His weight today is 168.4 pounds, blood pressure 142/76, temperature 97.7, pulse 68, and respirations 16.  General exam:  The patient is nontoxic and in no acute distress.  There is no labored breathing.  Psychiatric:  He is alert and oriented times 3.  Ears:  Tympanic membranes pearly gray bilaterally.  Mouth:  No erythema, ulcers, vesicles, or exudate noted.  Eyes:  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light bilaterally.  Neck is supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation.  No rales, rhonchi, or wheezing.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur.  Extremities:  No edema, cyanosis, or clubbing.
ASSESSMENT:
1.  Palpitations, possibly related to anxiety.
2.  Fatigue.
3.  Loose stools with some green color and also some nausea.  There has been no vomiting, possibly a touch of gastroenteritis going on here.
PLAN:
The patient admits he has been putting this off now for about two weeks.  He says his work is definitely contributing to some of his symptoms and he feels stressed.  He is leaving for a vacation very soon.  Unfortunately, he is actually leaving Wednesday for XYZ, which puts us into a bit of a bind in terms of doing testing on him.  My overall opinion is he has some anxiety related issues and he may also have a touch of gastroenteritis.  A 12-lead EKG was performed on him in the office today.  This EKG was compared with the previous EKG contained in the chart from 2006 and I see that these EKGs look very similar with no significant changes noted, which is definitely a good news.  I am going to send him to the lab from our office to get the following tests done:  Comprehensive metabolic profile, CBC, urinalysis with reflex to culture and we will also get a chest X-ray.  Tomorrow morning I will manage to schedule him for an exercise stress test at Bad Axe Hospital.  We were able to squeeze him in.  His appointment is at 8:15 in the morning.  He is going to have the stress test done in the morning and he will come back to the office in the afternoon for recheck.  I am not going to be here so he is going to see Dr. X.  Dr. X should hopefully be able to call over and speak with the physician who attended the stress test and get a preliminary result before he leaves for XYZ.  Certainly, if something comes up we may need to postpone his trip.  We petitioned his medical records from his former physician and with luck we will be able to find out what medication he was on about nine or ten years ago.  In the meantime I have given him Ativan 0.5 mg one tablet two to three times a day as needed for anxiety.  I talked about Ativan, how it works.  I talked about the side effects.  I told him to use it only as needed and we can see how he is doing tomorrow when he comes back for his recheck.  I took him off of work today and tomorrow so he could rest.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i haven't been feeling well for about two weeks. i thought it was just stress and anxiety. but then, i started having palpitations and it's been really tiring.
[doctor] i see. these palpitations, do they cause any chest pain?
[patient] sometimes, but not always. and it's not triggered by any exertion.
[doctor] okay. i'll have you take some tests to check your heart. also, you mentioned having loose stools with green color and some nausea. are you having any abdominal pain?
[patient] no abdominal pain, just nausea.
[doctor] alright. i'll also have you take some tests for your gastrointestinal system. i noticed your blood pressure is slightly elevated, have you been feeling stressed?
[patient] yes, my job has been getting to me lately.
[doctor] that might be the cause of your symptoms. i'm going to prescribe you ativan for your anxiety. use it only as needed. i'll also have you take a stress test tomorrow morning at bad axe hospital. it's important for us to check your heart. you'll come back in the afternoon for a recheck with dr. x. if everything is okay, you can still go on your trip. but if we find something that needs attention, we may have to postpone it.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?

"SUBJECTIVE:
The patient is a 44-year-old white female who is here today with multiple problems.  The biggest concern she has today is her that left leg has been swollen.  It is swollen for three years to some extent, but worse for the past two to three months.  It gets better in the morning when she is up, but then through the day it begins to swell again.  Lately it is staying bigger and she somewhat uncomfortable with it being so large.  The right leg also swells, but not nearly like the left leg.  The other problem she had was she has had pain in her shoulder and back.  These occurred about a year ago, but the pain in her left shoulder is of most concern to her.  She feels like the low back pain is just a result of a poor mattress.  She does not remember hurting her shoulder, but she said gradually she has lost some mobility.  It is hard time to get her hands behind her back or behind her head.  She has lost strength in the left shoulder.  As far as the blood count goes, she had an elevated white count.  In April of 2005, Dr. XYZ had asked Dr. XYZ to see her because of the persistent leukocytosis; however, Dr. XYZ felt that this was not a problem for the patient and asked her to just return here for follow up.  She also complains of a lot of frequency with urination and nocturia times two to three.  She has gained weight; she thinks about 12 pounds since March.  She now weighs 284.  Fortunately, her blood pressure is staying stable.  She takes atenolol 12.5 mg per day and takes Lasix on a p.r.n. basis, but does not like to take it because it causes her to urinate so much.  She denies chest pain, but she does feel like she is becoming gradually more short of breath.  She works for the city of Wichita as bus dispatcher, so she does sit a lot, and just really does not move around much.  Towards the end of the day her leg was really swollen.  I reviewed her lab work.  Other than the blood count her lab work has been pretty normal, but she does need to have a cholesterol check.
OBJECTIVE:
General:  The patient is a very pleasant 44-year-old white female quite obese.
Vital Signs:  Blood pressure:  122/70.  Temperature:  98.6.
HEENT:  Head:  Normocephalic.  Ears:  TMs intact.  Eyes:  Pupils round, and equal.  Nose:  Mucosa normal.  Throat:  Mucosa normal.
Lungs:  Clear.
Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm.
Abdomen:  Soft and obese.
Extremities:  A lot of fluid in both legs, but especially the left leg is really swollen.  At least 2+ pedal edema.  The right leg just has a trace of edema.  She has pain in her low back with range of motion.  She has a lot of pain in her left shoulder with range of motion.  It is hard for her to get her hand behind her back.  She cannot get it up behind her head.  She has pain in the anterior left shoulder in that area.
ASSESSMENT:
1.  Multiple problems including left leg swelling.
2.  History of leukocytosis.
3.  Joint pain involving the left shoulder, probably impingement syndrome.
4.  Low back pain, chronic with obesity.
5.  Obesity.
6.  Frequency with urination.
7.  Tobacco abuse.
PLAN:
1.  I will schedule for a venous Doppler of the left leg and will have her come back in the morning for a CBC and a metabolic panel.  We will start her on Detrol 0.4 mg one daily and also started on Mobic 15 mg per day.
2.  Elevate her leg as much as possible and wear support hose if possible.  Keep her foot up during the day.  We will see her back in two weeks.  We will have the results of the Doppler, the lab work and see how she is doing with the Detrol and the joint pain.  If her shoulder pain is not any better, we probably should refer her on over to orthopedist.  We did do x-rays of her shoulder today that did not show anything remarkable.  See her in two weeks or p.r.n.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?

"SUBJECTIVE:
This is a 56-year-old female who comes in for a dietary consultation for hyperlipidemia, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease and weight reduction.  The patient states that her husband has been diagnosed with high blood cholesterol as well.  She wants some support with some dietary recommendations to assist both of them in healthier eating.  The two of them live alone now, and she is used to cooking for large portions.  She is having a hard time adjusting to preparing food for the two of them.  She would like to do less food preparation, in fact.  She is starting a new job this week.
OBJECTIVE:
Her reported height is 5 feet 4 inches.  Today’s weight was 170 pounds.  BMI is approximately 29.  A diet history was obtained.  I instructed the patient on a 1200 calorie meal plan emphasizing low-saturated fat sources with moderate amounts of sodium as well.  Information on fast food eating was supplied, and additional information on low-fat eating was also supplied.
ASSESSMENT:
The patient’s basal energy expenditure is estimated at 1361 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirement for weight maintenance is estimated at 1759 calories a day.  Her diet history reflects that she is making some very healthy food choices on a regular basis.  She does emphasize a lot of fruits and vegetables, trying to get a fruit or a vegetable or both at most meals.  She also is emphasizing lower fat selections.  Her physical activity level is moderate at this time.  She is currently walking for 20 minutes four or five days out of the week but at a very moderate pace with a friend.  We reviewed the efforts at weight reduction identifying 3500 calories in a pound of body fat and the need to gradually and slowly chip away at this number on a long-term basis for weight reduction.  We discussed the need to reduce calories from what her current patterns are and to hopefully increase physical activity slightly as well.  We discussed menu selection, as well as food preparation techniques.  The patient appears to have been influenced by the current low-carb, high-protein craze and had really limited her food selections based on that.  I was able to give her some more room for variety including some moderate portions of potatoes, pasta and even on occasion breading her meat as long as she prepares it in a low-fat fashion which was discussed.
PLAN:
Recommend the patient increase the intensity and the duration of her physical activity with a goal of 30 minutes five days a week working at a brisk walk.  Recommend the patient reduce calories by 500 daily to support a weight loss of one pound a week.  This translates into a 1200-calorie meal plan.  I encouraged the patient to keep food records in order to better track calories consumed.  I recommended low fat selections and especially those that are lower in saturated fats.  Emphasis would be placed on moderating portions of meat and having more moderate snacks between meals as well.  This was a one-hour consultation.  I provided my name and number should additional needs arise.","[doctor]: hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient]: i'm doing well, thank you.
[doctor]: i see that you came in for a dietary consultation. can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on with your diet lately?
[patient]: yes, so i have hyperlipidemia, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease and i'm also trying to reduce my weight. my husband was recently diagnosed with high blood cholesterol as well, so we're both trying to eat healthier.
[doctor]: i see. and how has that been going for you so far?
[patient]: it's been a bit difficult. i'm used to cooking for larger portions and we're both trying to adjust to eating less. i'm also starting a new job this week, so i'm a bit nervous about how that will impact my diet.
[doctor]: i understand. well, i can definitely help you with some dietary recommendations. based on your height and weight, it looks like your bmi is around 29, which is considered overweight. we can work on reducing your calorie intake to achieve weight loss. i recommend a 1200 calorie meal plan with low-saturated fat sources and moderate amounts of sodium.
[patient]: okay, that sounds good. do you have any tips for reducing my calorie intake?
[doctor]: yes, i recommend keeping a food diary to help you track your calorie intake. i also suggest reducing your portion sizes and choosing lower-fat options. it's important to make sure you're getting enough fruits and vegetables as well.
[patient]: that makes sense. i've been trying to eat more fruits and vegetables, but i'm not sure if i'm getting enough.
[doctor]: it sounds like you're on the right track. we can also work on increasing your physical activity level. right now, you're walking for 20 minutes four or five days a week. i recommend gradually increasing the duration and intensity of your walks to aim for 30 minutes of brisk walking five days a week.
[patient]: okay, i can do that. do you have any other suggestions for me?
[doctor]: yes, i want to emphasize the importance of choosing low-fat selections, especially those that are lower in saturated fats. you mentioned that you've been limiting your food selections based on the low-carb, high-protein craze, but it's important to have a variety of foods in your diet. you can still have moderate portions of potatoes, pasta and meat as long as you prepare them in a low-fat fashion. i also want you to have more moderate snacks between meals to help keep your metabolism going.
[patient]: that all sounds very doable. thank you for your help.
[doctor]: of course. i provided my name and number in case you have any additional questions or concerns. let's plan to follow up in a few weeks to see how you're doing.","[doctor]: hi there! how are you feeling today?
[patient]: um, i'm doing well, thank you.
[doctor]: mm-hmm, i see that you came in for a dietary consultation. can you tell me a bit about what's been going on with your diet lately?
[patient]: yes, so i have hyperlipidemia, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and i'm also trying to reduce my weight. my husband was recently diagnosed with high blood cholesterol as well, so we're both trying to eat healthier.
[doctor]: i see. and how has that been going for you so far?
[patient]: it's been a bit difficult. i'm used to cooking for larger portions, and we're both trying to adjust to eating less. i'm also starting a new job this week, so i'm a bit nervous about how that will impact my diet.
[doctor]: i understand. well, i can definitely help you with some dietary recommendations. based on your height and weight, it looks like your bmi is around 29, which is considered overweight. we can work on reducing your calorie intake to achieve weight loss. i recommend a 1200 calorie meal plan with low-saturated fat sources and moderate amounts of sodium.
[patient]: okay, that sounds good. do you have any tips for reducing my calorie intake?
[doctor]: yes, i recommend keeping a food diary to help you track your calorie intake. i also suggest reducing your portion sizes and choosing lower-fat options. it's important to make sure you're getting enough fruits and vegetables as well.
[patient]: mm-hmm, that makes sense. i've been trying to eat more fruits and vegetables, but i'm not sure if i'm getting enough.
[doctor]: it sounds like you're on the right track. we can also work on increasing your physical activity level. right now, you're walking for 20 minutes four or five days a week. i recommend gradually increasing the duration and intensity of your walks to aim for 30 minutes of brisk walking five days a week.
[patient]: okay, i can do that. do you have any other suggestions for me?
[doctor]: yes, i want to emphasize the importance of choosing low-fat selections, especially those that are lower in saturated fats. you mentioned that you've been limiting your food selections based on the low-carb, high-protein craze, but it's important to have a variety of foods in your diet. you can still have moderate portions of potatoes, pasta, and meat as long as you prepare them in a low-fat fashion. i also want you to have more moderate snacks between meals to help keep your metabolism going.

"SUBJECTIVE:
This is a followup dietary consultation for hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and possible metabolic syndrome.  The patient reports that she has worked hard for a number of weeks following the meal plan prescribed, but felt like she was gaining weight and not losing weight on it.  She is not sure that she was following it accurately.  She is trying to walk 1-1/2 to 2 miles every other day, but is increasing her time in the garden and doing other yard work as well.  Once she started experiencing some weight gain, she went back to her old South Beach Diet and felt like she was able to take some of that weight off.  However she realizes that the South Beach Diet is not a healthy diet for her and so is coming back for better instruction on safe weight loss and low-fat eating.
OBJECTIVE:
Weight is 275 pounds.  Food records were reviewed.
ASSESSMENT:
The patient experienced a weight gain of 2 pounds since our last consultation which was two months ago.  I did carefully review her food records and evaluated calories consumed.  While she was carefully tracking the volume of protein and carbohydrates, she was getting some excess calories from the fatty proteins selected.  Thus we rearranged her meal plan a little bit and talked about how to track her fat calories as well.  She was more open to reducing the amount of protein from the previous meal plan and increasing slightly the amount of carbohydrates.  While this still is not as much carbohydrate as I would normally recommend, I am certainly willing to work with her on how she feels her body best handles weight reduction.  We also discussed a snack that could be eliminated in the morning because she really is not hungry at that time.
PLAN:
A new 1500 calorie meal plan was developed based on 35% of the calories coming from protein, 40% of the calories from carbohydrate, and 25% of the calories from fat.  This translates in to 10 servings at 15 grams a piece of carbohydrates throughout the day dividing them in to groups of two servings per meal and per snack.  This also translates in to 2 ounces of protein at breakfast, 6 ounces at lunch, 2 ounces in the afternoon snack, 6 ounces at supper, and 2 ounces in the evening snack.  We have eliminated the morning snack.  The patient will now track the grams of fat in her meats as well as added fats.  Her goal for total fats over the course of the day is no more than 42 grams of fat per day.  This was a half hour consultation.  We will plan to see the patient back in one month for support.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, doctor. i'm okay, thank you.
[doctor] so, i see that you have been working hard to follow the meal plan we discussed during the last consultation. can you tell me how it's been going?
[patient] well, i have been trying my best, but i felt like i was gaining weight instead of losing it. so, i started following my old south beach diet, but i know it's not a healthy option.
[doctor] i understand your concern. let's talk about your weight gain. have you been keeping track of what you're eating?
[patient] yes, i have been keeping a record of my meals.
[doctor] i reviewed your food records, and i noticed that you were consuming more fatty proteins than needed, which caused an excess of calories. so, we'll have to make some changes to your meal plan.
[patient] okay, i'm open to suggestions.
[doctor] i have made a new meal plan based on 35% protein calories, 40% carbohydrate calories, and 25% fat calories. you'll have to reduce the amount of protein and increase the amount of carbohydrates slightly. we'll also have to eliminate one snack from your plan. you'll track the grams of fat in your meats as well as added fats. your goal for total fats over the course of the day is no more than 42 grams per day.
[patient] okay, that sounds doable.
[doctor] the meal plan will have 10 servings of 15 grams of carbohydrates throughout the day, divided into two servings per meal and per snack. your protein intake will be 2 ounces at breakfast, 6 ounces at lunch, 2 ounces in the afternoon snack, 6 ounces at supper, and 2 ounces in the evening snack.
[patient] alright, i'll follow it.
[doctor] great. we'll see you in a month to check your progress and provide you with support.","[doctor] hey there, how're you feeling today?
[patient] hey doc, i'm doing alright, thanks for asking.
[doctor] so, how's the meal plan we discussed last time working out for you?
[patient] um, well, i tried my best, but it felt like i was gaining weight instead of losing it. so, i went back to my old south beach diet, but i know it's not the healthiest option.
[doctor] i hear you. let's talk about the weight gain. have you been keeping track of what you're eating?
[patient] mm-hmm, i've been writing down everything i eat.
[doctor] i looked over your food records, and i saw that you were consuming more fatty proteins than you should be, which caused an excess of calories. we'll need to make some changes to your meal plan.
[patient] sure, i'm open to suggestions.
[doctor] i tweaked the meal plan to consist of 35% protein calories, 40% carbohydrate calories, and 25% fat calories. you'll need to slightly reduce protein intake and increase carbohydrates. we'll also need to eliminate one snack from your plan. you'll track the grams of fat in your meats and added fats. your goal for total fats over the course of the day is no more than 42 grams per day.
[patient] got it, that sounds good.
[doctor] great, the meal plan will have 10 servings of 15 grams of carbohydrates throughout the day, divided into two servings per meal and per snack. your protein intake will be 2 ounces at breakfast, 6 ounces at lunch, 2 ounces in the afternoon snack, 6 ounces at supper, and 2 ounces in the evening snack.
[patient] okay, i'll give it a shot.
[doctor] perfect. we'll see you in a month to check how you're doing and provide support.",2
"SUBJECTIVE:
This is a 38-year-old female who comes for dietary consultation for gestational diabetes.  Patient reports that she is scared to eat because of its impact on her blood sugars.  She is actually trying not to eat while she is working third shift at Wal-Mart.  Historically however, she likes to eat out with a high frequency.  She enjoys eating rice as part of her meals.  She is complaining of feeling fatigued and tired all the time because she works from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. at Wal-Mart and has young children at home.  She sleeps two to four hours at a time throughout the day.  She has been testing for ketones first thing in the morning when she gets home from work.
OBJECTIVE:
Today's weight:  155.5 pounds.  Weight from 10/07/04 was 156.7 pounds.  A diet history was obtained.  Blood sugar records for the last three days reveal the following:  fasting blood sugars 83, 84, 87, 77; two-hour postprandial breakfast 116, 107, 97; pre-lunch 85, 108, 77; two-hour postprandial lunch 86, 131, 100; pre-supper 78, 91, 100; two-hour postprandial supper 125, 121, 161; bedtime 104, 90 and 88.  I instructed the patient on dietary guidelines for gestational diabetes.  The Lily Guide for Meal Planning was provided and reviewed.  Additional information on gestational diabetes was applied.  A sample 2000-calorie meal plan was provided with a carbohydrate budget established.
ASSESSMENT:
Patient's basal energy expenditure adjusted for obesity is estimated at 1336 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirements, including a physical activity factor as well as additional calories for pregnancy, totals to 2036 calories per day.  Her diet history reveals that she has somewhat irregular eating patterns.  In the last 24 hours when she was working at Wal-Mart, she ate at 5 a.m. but did not eat anything prior to that since starting work at 10 p.m.  We discussed the need for small frequent eating.  We identified carbohydrate as the food source that contributes to the blood glucose response.  We identified carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing that they are all good for her.  The only carbohydrates she was asked to entirely avoid would be the concentrated forms of refined sugars.  In regard to use of her traditional foods of rice, I pulled out a one-third cup measuring cup to identify a 15-gram equivalent of rice.  We discussed the need for moderating the portion of carbohydrates consumed at one given time.  Emphasis was placed at eating with a high frequency with a goal of eating every two to four hours over the course of the day when she is awake.  Her weight loss was discouraged.  Patient was encouraged to eat more generously but with attention to the amount of carbohydrates consumed at a time.
PLAN:
The meal plan provided has a carbohydrate content that represents 40 percent of a 2000-calorie meal plan.  The meal plan was devised to distribute her carbohydrates more evenly throughout the day.  The meal plan was meant to reflect an example for her eating, while the patient was encouraged to eat according to appetite and not to go without eating for long periods of time.  The meal plan is as follows:  breakfast 2 carbohydrate servings, snack 1 carbohydrate serving, lunch 2-3 carbohydrate servings, snack 1 carbohydrate serving, dinner 2-3 carbohydrate servings, bedtime snack 1-2 carbohydrate servings.  Recommend patient include a solid protein with each of her meals as well as with her snack that occurs before going to sleep.  Encouraged adequate rest.  Also recommend adequate calories to sustain weight gain of one-half to one pound per week.  If the meal plan reflected does not support slow gradual weight gain, then we will need to add more foods accordingly.  This was a one-hour consultation.  I provided my name and number should additional needs arise.","[doctor] hi there! how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, doctor. i'm feeling a little worried about my gestational diabetes.
[doctor] i understand. it can be a scary condition to deal with. can you share with me a little bit about your concerns?
[patient] yes, i'm scared to eat because i don't want to affect my blood sugars. i'm even trying to skip meals while i'm working.
[doctor] i see. that's not a good approach to managing your gestational diabetes. can you tell me more about your eating habits?
[patient] i usually eat out a lot and i love to have rice with my meals.
[doctor] i understand. we will need to modify your eating habits to help manage your gestational diabetes. let's start with a small, frequent eating pattern. can you try to eat every two to four hours over the course of the day while you are awake?
[patient] i can certainly try.
[doctor] great. we also need to be mindful of the amount and type of carbohydrates you consume, as they affect your blood sugar levels. we will create a carbohydrate budget for you and i will provide you with guidelines on how to choose the right foods to eat.
[patient] okay, sounds good.
[doctor] i will also provide you with a meal plan that reflects your calorie needs and carbohydrate budget. it is important to eat a balanced diet to ensure you and your baby are getting the right amount of nutrients.
[patient] that makes sense.
[doctor] lastly, i want to remind you to prioritize rest and adequate sleep. it is important for both you and your baby's health.
[patient] i will definitely try to get more rest.

"SUBJECTIVE:
This is a 28-year-old female who comes for dietary consultation for diabetes during pregnancy.  Patient reports that she had gestational diabetes with her first pregnancy.  She did use insulin at that time as well.  She does not fully understand what ketones are.  She walks her daughter to school and back home each day which takes 20 minutes each way.  She is not a big milk drinker, but she does try to drink some.
OBJECTIVE:
Weight is 238.3 pounds.  Weight from last week’s visit was 238.9 pounds.  Prepregnancy weight is reported at 235 pounds.  Height is 62-3/4 inches.  Prepregnancy BMI is approximately 42-1/2.  Insulin schedule is NovoLog 70/30, 20 units in the morning and 13 units at supper time.  Blood sugar records for the last week reveal the following:  Fasting blood sugars ranging from 92 to 104 with an average of 97, two-hour postprandial breakfast readings ranging from 172 to 196 with an average of 181, two-hour postprandial lunch readings ranging from 149 to 189 with an average of 168 and two-hour postprandial dinner readings ranging from 109 to 121 with an average of 116.  Overall average is 140.  A diet history was obtained.  Expected date of confinement is May 1, 2005.  Instructed the patient on dietary guidelines for gestational diabetes.  A 2300 meal plan was provided and reviewed.  The Lily Guide for Meal Planning was provided and reviewed.
ASSESSMENT:
Patient’s basal energy expenditure adjusted for obesity is estimated at 1566 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirements, including physical activity factors as well as additional calories for pregnancy, totals 2367 calories a day.  Her diet history reveals that she is eating three meals a day and three snacks.  The snacks were just added last week following presence of ketones in her urine.  We identified carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing that they are the foods that raise blood sugar the most.  We identified 15 gram equivalents of carbohydrate and established a carbohydrate budget.  We also discussed the goal of balancing food intake with blood sugar control and adequate caloric intake to sustain appropriate weight gain for the pregnancy of 1/2 a pound a week through the duration of the pregnancy.  We discussed the physiology of ketone production from inadequate calories or inadequate insulin and elevated blood sugars.  While a sample meal plan was provided reflecting the patient’s carbohydrate budget I emphasized the need for her to eat according to her appetite, but to work at consistency in the volume of carbohydrates consumed at a given meal or a given snack from day to day.  Patient was assured that we can titrate the insulin to match whatever eating pattern is suitable for her as long as she can do it on a consistent basis.  At the same time she was encouraged to continue to eliminate the more concentrated forms of refined carbohydrates.
PLAN:
Recommend the patient work with the following meal plan with a carbohydrate budget representing approximately 45% of the calories from carbohydrate.  Breakfast:  Three carbohydrate servings.  Morning snack:  One carbohydrate serving.  Lunch:  Four carbohydrate servings.  Afternoon snack:  One carbohydrate serving.  Supper:  Four carbohydrate servings.  Bedtime snack:  One carbohydrate serving.  Encouraged patient to include some solid protein with each of her meals as well as with the bedtime snack.  Encouraged three servings of dairy products per day to meet nutritional needs for calcium during pregnancy.  Recommend patient include a fruit or a vegetable with most of her meals.  Also recommend including solid protein with each meal as well as with the bedtime snack.  Charlie Athene reviewed blood sugars at this consultation as well, and made the following insulin adjustment:  Morning 70/30, will increase from 20 units up to 24 units and evening 70/30, we will increase from 13 units up to 16 units.  Patient was encouraged to call in blood sugars at the end of the week if they are outside of the range of over 90 fasting and over 120 two-hour postprandial.  Provided my name and number should there be additional dietary questions.","[doctor] hi, how are you doing today?

"SUBJECTIVE:
The patient is a 79-year-old African-American female with a self reported height of 5 foot 3 inches and weight of 197 pounds.  She was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 1983.  She is not allergic to any medicines.
DIABETES MEDICATIONS:
Her diabetes medications include Humulin insulin 70/30, 44 units at breakfast and 22 units at supper.  Also metformin 500 mg at supper.
OTHER MEDICATIONS:
Other medications include verapamil, Benicar, Toprol, clonidine, and hydrochlorothiazide.
ASSESSMENT:
The patient and her daughter completed both days of diabetes education in a group setting.  Blood glucose records and food diaries are reviewed by the diabetes educator and the dietician.  Fasting blood sugars are 127, 80, and 80.  Two-hour postprandial breakfast reading was 105, two-hour postprandial lunch reading was 88, and two-hour postprandial dinner reading was 73 and 63.  Her diet was excellent.
Seven hours of counseling about diabetes mellitus was provided on this date.
Blood glucose values obtained at 10 a.m. were 84 and at 2.30 p.m. were 109.  Assessment of her knowledge is completed at the end of the counseling session.  She demonstrated increased knowledge in all areas and had no further questions.  She also completed an evaluation of the class.
The patient's feet were examined during the education session.  She had flat feet bilaterally.  Skin color was pink, temperature warm.  Pedal pulses 2+.  Her right second and third toes lay on each other.  Also, the same on her left foot.  However, there was no skin breakdown.  She had large bunions, medial aspect of the ball of both feet.  She had positive sensitivity to most areas of her feet, however, she had negative sensitivity to the medial and lateral aspect of the balls of her left foot.
During the education session, she set behavioral goals for self care.  First goal is to eat three meals a day and eat three snacks daily to improve her blood glucose levels.  Second goal is to eat a well balanced meal at 1200 calories in order to lose one-half pound of weight per week and improve her blood glucose control.  Third goal is to exercise by walking for 15 to 30 minutes a day, three to five days a week to increase her blood glucose control.  Her success in achieving these goals will be followed in three months by a letter from the diabetes education class.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Since she is doing so well with her diet changes, her blood sugars have been within normal limits and sometimes on the low side, especially considering the fact that she has low blood sugar unawareness.  She is to followup with Dr. XYZ for possible reduction in her insulin doses.","[doctor] hi, how are you doing today?
[patient] i'm doing well, thank you.
[doctor] that's great to hear. i see here that you recently completed two days of diabetes education. can you tell me a little bit about what you learned during those sessions?
[patient] yes, the educators went over my blood glucose records and food diaries. they provided me with seven hours of counseling about diabetes mellitus and i set some behavioral goals for self-care.
[doctor] that's great to hear. i also see that your blood sugars have been within normal limits and sometimes on the low side. have you noticed any symptoms of low blood sugar?
[patient] no, i haven't.
[doctor] alright. based on your progress, i recommend that you follow up with dr. xyz for a possible reduction in your insulin doses. how do you feel about that?
[patient] that sounds good to me. thank you.","[doctor] hi there, how ya doing today?
[patient] um, doing pretty good, thanks.
[doctor] awesome. so, i see that you recently finished two days of diabetes education. can you tell me a little bit about what you learned during those sessions?
[patient] yeah, sure. so, the educators went over my blood glucose records and food diaries. they gave me about seven hours of counseling about diabetes mellitus and i set some behavioral goals for self-care.
[doctor] mm-hmm, sounds like they were pretty thorough. i also noticed that your blood sugars have been within normal limits and sometimes on the low side. have you noticed any symptoms of low blood sugar?
[patient] nope, not really.
[doctor] alrighty. based on your progress, i recommend that you follow up with dr. xyz for a possible reduction in your insulin doses. how do you feel about that?

"SUBJECTIVE:
His brother, although he is a vegetarian, has elevated cholesterol and he is on medication to lower it.  The patient started improving his diet when he received the letter explaining his lipids are elevated.  He is consuming less cappuccino, quiche, crescents, candy from vending machines, etc.  He has started packing his lunch three to four times per week instead of eating out so much.  He is exercising six to seven days per week by swimming, biking, running, lifting weights one and a half to two and a half hours each time.  He is in training for a triathlon.  He says he is already losing weight due to his efforts.
OBJECTIVE:
Height:  6 foot 2 inches.  Weight:  204 pounds on 03/07/05.  Ideal body weight:  190 pounds, plus or minus ten percent.  He is 107 percent standard of midpoint ideal body weight.  BMI:  26.189.  A 48-year-old male.  Lab on 03/15/05:  Cholesterol:  251.  LDL:  166.  VLDL:  17.  HDL:  68.  Triglycerides:  87.  I explained to the patient the dietary guidelines to help improve his lipids.  I recommend a 26 to 51 to 77 fat grams per day for a 10 to 20 to 30 percent fat level of 2,300 calories since he is interested in losing weight.  I went over the printed information sheet on lowering your cholesterol and that was given to him along with a booklet on the same topic to read.  I encouraged him to continue as he is doing.
ASSESSMENT:
Basal energy expenditure 1960 x 1.44 activity factor is approximately 2,800 calories.  His 24-hour recall shows he is making many positive changes already to lower his fat and cholesterol intake.  He needs to continue as he is doing.  He verbalized understanding and seemed receptive.
PLAN:
The patient plans to recheck his lipids through Dr. XYZ  I gave him my phone number and he is to call me if he has any further questions regarding his diet.","[doctor] hi there! how are you doing today?
[patient] i’m doing well, thanks for asking.
[doctor] so, i see that you’ve been making some changes to your diet and exercise routine because of your elevated cholesterol levels. can you tell me a little bit more about those changes?
[patient] sure! i’ve been cutting back on foods like cappuccinos, quiches, crescents, and candy from vending machines. i’m also packing my lunch three to four times a week instead of eating out as much. and i’ve been exercising six to seven days a week with swimming, biking, running, and weight lifting for one and a half to two and a half hours each time.
[doctor] that’s great! it sounds like you’ve been really dedicated to making some positive changes. and have you noticed any changes in your weight or how you feel?
[patient] yes, i’ve already started to lose weight and i feel a lot better overall.
[doctor] excellent! now let’s take a look at your lab results. your cholesterol levels are still elevated, but your hdl is in a good range. based on your height, weight, and other factors, i recommend a diet with 26 to 51 to 77 grams of fat per day for a 10 to 20 to 30 percent fat level of 2,300 calories. i also gave you some printed information on lowering your cholesterol, correct?
[patient] yes, you did.
[doctor] great. and it looks like you’re already making a lot of positive changes. i encourage you to continue with your current diet and exercise routine, and to follow up with dr. xyz to recheck your lipids. if you have any further questions or concerns, don’t hesitate to give me a call.","[doctor] hey! how's it going?

"SUBJECTIVE:
This is a 62-year-old female who comes for dietary consultation for carbohydrate counting for type I diabetes.  The patient reports that she was hospitalized over the weekend for DKA.  She indicates that her blood sugar on Friday night was 187 at bedtime and that when she woke up in the morning her blood sugar was 477.  She gave herself, in smaller increments, a total of 70 extra units of her Humalog.  Ten of those units were injectable; the others were in the forms of pump.  Her blood sugar was over 600 when she went to the hospital later that day.  She is here at this consultation complaining of not feeling well still because she has a cold.  She realizes that this is likely because her immune system was so minimized in the hospital.
OBJECTIVE:
Current insulin doses on her insulin pump are boluses set at 5 units at breakfast, 6 units at lunch and 11 units at supper.  Her basal rates have not been changed since her last visit with Charla Yassine and totaled 30.5 units per 24 hours.  A diet history was obtained.  I instructed the patient on carbohydrate counting at 1 unit of insulin for every 10 g carbohydrate ratio was recommended.  A correction dose of approximately 1 unit of insulin to bring the blood sugars down 30 mg/dl was also recommended.  The Lilly guide for meal planning was provided and reviewed.  Additional carbohydrate counting book was provided.
ASSESSMENT:
The patient was taught an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio of 1 unit to 10 g of carbohydrates as recommended at the previous visit two years ago, which she does not recall.  It is based on the 500 rule which suggests this ratio.  We did identify carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing 15-g equivalents.  We also identified the need to dose her insulin at the time that she is eating her carbohydrate sources.  She does seem to have a pattern of fixing blood sugars later in the day after they are elevated.  We discussed the other option of trying to eat a consistent amount of carbohydrates at meals from day to day and taking a consistent amount of insulin at those meals.  With this in mind, she was recommended to follow with three servings or 45 g of carbohydrate at breakfast, three servings or 45 g of carbohydrate at lunch and four servings or 60 g of carbohydrate at dinner.  Joanne Araiza joined our consultation briefly to discuss whether her pump was working appropriately.  The patient was given an 800 number for the pump to contact should there be any question about its failure to deliver insulin appropriately.
PLAN:
Recommend the patient use 1 unit of insulin for every 10-g carbohydrate load consumed.  Recommend the patient either use this as a carbohydrate counting tool or work harder at keeping carbohydrate content consistent at meals from day to day.  This was a one-hour consultation.  Provided my name and number should additional needs arise.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, i'm not feeling too good. i have a cold and i just got out of the hospital for dka over the weekend.
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that. can you tell me a bit more about what happened over the weekend?
[patient] yeah, on friday night my blood sugar was 187 at bedtime, and when i woke up on saturday morning, it was 477. i gave myself a total of 70 extra units of humalog throughout the day, 10 of which were injectable and the rest were through the pump. but my blood sugar was over 600 when i went to the hospital later that day.
[doctor] i see. how are you managing your insulin doses currently?
[patient] i have boluses set at 5 units for breakfast, 6 units for lunch and 11 units for supper. my basal rates haven't been changed since my last visit with charla yassine, and they total 30.5 units per 24 hours.
[doctor] okay. i'm going to recommend an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio of 1 unit to 10 grams of carbohydrates. this will help you count your carbs and better manage your insulin doses. we also discussed the option of trying to eat a consistent amount of carbohydrates at meals from day to day and taking a consistent amount of insulin at those meals.
[patient] alright. can you explain how that works?
[doctor] sure. i recommend that you follow with three servings or 45 grams of carbohydrate at breakfast, three servings or 45 grams of carbohydrate at lunch, and four servings or 60 grams of carbohydrate at dinner. this will help you keep your carbohydrate content consistent and make it easier to manage your insulin doses.
[patient] okay, i think i understand. what else can i do to better manage my diabetes?
[doctor] it's important to keep track of your carbohydrate intake and monitor your blood sugar levels regularly. i'll provide you with a carbohydrate counting book to help you track your intake, and i recommend using a correction dose of approximately 1 unit of insulin to bring your blood sugars down 30 mg/dl. we'll also provide you with the lilly guide for meal planning to help you make healthier choices.
[patient] that sounds good. is there anything else i should know?
[doctor] joanne araiza joined us briefly to discuss whether your pump was working appropriately. we gave you an 800 number for the pump to contact should there be any question about its failure to deliver insulin appropriately. and if you have any other questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to me.

"SUBJECTIVE:
The patient seeks evaluation for a second opinion concerning cataract extraction.  She tells me cataract extraction has been recommended in each eye; however, she is nervous to have surgery.  Past ocular surgery history is significant for neurovascular age-related macular degeneration.  She states she has had laser four times to the macula on the right and two times to the left, she sees Dr. X for this.
OBJECTIVE:
On examination, visual acuity with correction measures 20/400 OU.  Manifest refraction does not improve this.  There is no afferent pupillary defect.  Visual fields are grossly full to hand motions.  Intraocular pressure measures 17 mm in each eye.  Slit-lamp examination is significant for clear corneas OU.  There is early nuclear sclerosis in both eyes.  There is a sheet like 1-2+ posterior subcapsular cataract on the left.  Dilated examination shows choroidal neovascularization with subretinal heme and blood in both eyes.
ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
Advanced neurovascular age-related macular degeneration OU, this is ultimately visually limiting.  Cataracts are present in both eyes.  I doubt cataract removal will help increase visual acuity; however, I did discuss with the patient, especially in the left, cataract surgery will help Dr. X better visualize the macula for future laser treatment so that her current vision can be maintained.  This information was conveyed with the use of a translator.

School reports continuing difficulties with repetitive questioning, obsession with cleanness on a daily basis, concerned about his inability to relate this well in the classroom.  He appears confused and depressed at times.  Mother also indicates that preservative questioning had come down, but he started collecting old little toys that he did in the past.  He will attend social skills program in the summer.  ABCD indicated to me that they have identified two psychologists to refer him to for functional behavioral analysis.  There is lessening of tremoring in both hands since discontinuation of Zoloft.  He is now currently taking Abilify at 7.5 mg.
OBJECTIVE:
He came in less perseverative questioning, asked appropriate question about whether I talked to ABCD or not, greeted me with Japanese word to say hello, seemed less.

"PROCEDURE:
EEG during wakefulness demonstrates background activity consisting of moderate-amplitude beta activity seen bilaterally.  The EEG background is symmetric.  Independent, small, positive, sharp wave activity is seen in the frontotemporal regions bilaterally with sharp-slow wave discharges seen more predominantly in the right frontotemporal head region.  No clinical signs of involuntary movements are noted during synchronous video monitoring.  Recording time is 22 minutes and 22 seconds.  There is attenuation of the background, faster activity during drowsiness and some light sleep is recorded.  No sustained epileptogenic activity is evident, but the independent bilateral sharp wave activity is seen intermittently.  Photic stimulation induced a bilaterally symmetric photic driving response.
IMPRESSION:
EEG during wakefulness and light sleep is abnormal with independent, positive sharp wave activity seen in both frontotemporal head regions, more predominant in the right frontotemporal region.  The EEG findings are consistent with potentially epileptogenic process.  Clinical correlation is warranted.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?

[patient] yes, my primary care physician referred me for an eeg because i've been having some issues with seizures.
[doctor] okay, well the results of your eeg show that there is some abnormal activity in both of your frontotemporal head regions, more so in the right side. this activity could be related to a potentially epileptogenic process. have you experienced any involuntary movements or seizures recently?
[patient] i've had a few episodes of involuntary movements, but i haven't had a full seizure in a while.

"CLINICAL HISTORY:
This is a 16-year-old man evaluated for sleep difficulties.  He states he is ""feeling bad in the mornings"" that he has daytime somnolence and ""whenever I wake up I experience dizziness, weakness, stomachache, loss of appetite, drowsiness, overall sore body and a general feeling of unwell.""  He does state that he has only rarely he got anything suggestive of restless leg syndrome, is unaware of any apnea or like symptoms.  He has a mouth breather.  He states he wakens up during the night, usually goes to bed at 10 to 11, gets up at 7 to 7:30.  In the weekends, he stays up late and sleeps until 1 in the afternoon.  He lists sporadic use of melatonin and Benadryl, and Tylenol PM for sleep.  His other medicines are Accutane, Nasonex and oxymetazoline.  There is no smoking, no alcohol intake.  He does have three caffeinated beverages a week.  He is 75 inches, 185 pounds, BMI 23.1.  He rated himself 4/7 on the Stanford Sleepiness Scale at the onset of the study and 6 on the Epworth Sleeping Scale, said that his night sleep in the lab was characterized by a longer than usual sleep onset latency with more arousals than usual.  He woke up feeling equally rested and the only comment he made on the post sleep questionnaire was ""some of the wires"" is the source of problems.
TECHNIQUE:
The study was performed with the following parameters measured throughout the entirety of the recording:
Electroencephalogram, electromyogram of the chin and lower extremities, electrooculogram, electrocardiogram, air flow from the nose and mouth, respiratory effort at the chest and abdomen, and finger oximetry.
The record was scored for sleep and the various other parameters in 30-second epochs.
RESULTS:
This study was performed in 61 minutes in duration during which he slept 432 minutes after 19 minutes sleep onset latency; thereafter, he had 10 awakenings for 6 minutes of wakefulness giving him a normal sleep efficiency of 95%.  Sleep staging was actually fairly deep and normal for age with 5% stage I, 51% stage II, 22% slow wave sleep and 22% REM.  He had 5 REM periods during the night.  The first beginning 66 minutes after sleep onset.  He did have 63 arousals, giving him a borderline elevated arousal index of 8.8, 16 were driven by limb movements, 41 of unclear origin, 6 from hypopneas.
EEG PARAMETERS:
No abnormalities.
EKG PARAMETERS:
Normal sinus rhythm, mean rate 76, no ectopics noted.
EMG PARAMETERS:
88 PLMs were noted.  There was fairly small excursion with a movement index of 12, only 16 led to arousals with a movement arousal index of 2.2, not considered as a significant feature for sleep fragmentation.
RESPIRATORY PARAMETERS:
Breathing rate in the high teens, reaching as high as 20 in REM.  There was really no snoring noted.  He slept in all positions and during the night had 9 respiratory events, one was a postarousal central event, the other eight were obstructive hypopneas mean duration 26 seconds, little worse in the supine position where his AHI was 4.7, but overall his AHI was 1.3.  This is only a marginal abnormality and is well below the threshold for CPAP intervention.
IMPRESSION:
Largely normal polysomnogram demonstrating very modest obstructive sleep apnea in the supine position and a very modest periodic limb movement disturbance.","[doctor] hi there! so you're here because of sleep difficulties?
[patient] yes, i wake up feeling dizzy, weak and with a stomachache. i also have daytime sleepiness and a general feeling of unwell.

[doctor] i see. do you have any other medical conditions or take any medications besides those you mentioned?
[patient] i take accutane, nasonex and oxymetazoline.
[doctor] alright, let's talk about your sleep study results. overall, your sleep efficiency was normal at 95%, and your sleep staging was also normal for your age. however, you did have a few respiratory events during the night, indicating mild sleep apnea, particularly when sleeping on your back. additionally, you had some leg movements during sleep.
[patient] is that serious?
[doctor] no, it's not too severe, but we may want to take some steps to address it. we can discuss lifestyle changes, such as weight loss and avoiding sleeping on your back. we can also consider a continuous positive airway pressure (cpap) machine to help with the sleep apnea. as for the leg movements, we can consider medication or other therapies to help with that.
[patient] okay, that sounds good. thank you for explaining everything to me.

"HISTORY:
This is a digital EEG performed on a 75-year-old male with seizures.
BACKGROUND ACTIVITY:
The background activity consists of a 8 Hz to 9 Hz rhythm arising in the posterior head region. This rhythm is also accompanied by some beta activity which occurs infrequently. There are also muscle contractions occurring at 4 Hz to 5 Hz which suggests possible Parkinson's. Part of the EEG is obscured by the muscle contraction artifact. There are also left temporal sharps occurring infrequently during the tracing. At one point of time, there was some slowing occurring in the right frontal head region.
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Photic stimulation was performed and did not show any significant abnormality.
SLEEP PATTERNS:
No sleep architecture was observed during this tracing.
IMPRESSION:
This awake/alert/drowsy EEG is abnormal due to the presence of slowing in the right frontal head region, due to the presence of sharps arising in the left temporal head region, and due to the tremors. The slowing can be consistent with underlying structural abnormalities, so a stroke, subdural hematoma, etc.
should be ruled out. The tremor probably represents a Parkinson's tremor and the sharps arising in the left temporal head region can potentially give way to seizures or may also represent underlying structural abnormalities, so clinical correlation is recommended.","[doctor] hi there! i see from your chart that you've been experiencing seizures. can you tell me a bit more about that?
[patient] yes, i've been having seizures and they're affecting my daily life.
[doctor] okay, well, we performed a digital eeg on you to get a better understanding of what's going on in your brain. the results show that there is a rhythm in the posterior head region that ranges from 8 hz to 9 hz, accompanied by beta activity which occurs infrequently. additionally, there are muscle contractions occurring at 4 hz to 5 hz which suggests possible parkinson's. there are also left temporal sharps occurring infrequently during the tracing. at one point, there was some slowing occurring in the right frontal head region. do you have any questions about what that means?
[patient] not really, but what could be causing this?
[doctor] well, the slowing in the right frontal head region could be consistent with underlying structural abnormalities, such as a stroke or subdural hematoma, so we would want to rule those out. the tremor is likely a parkinson's tremor, and the sharps arising in the left temporal head region can potentially give way to seizures or may also represent underlying structural abnormalities. in any case, we recommend doing further clinical correlation to better understand what's going on. 
[patient] okay, what's the next step then?
[doctor] we'll need to do some additional testing to rule out any underlying structural abnormalities. we'll also want to monitor your condition and track any changes to your symptoms. in the meantime, we may prescribe medications to manage your seizures and tremors. do you have any concerns about taking medication?
[patient] no, i'm willing to try anything that will help.
[doctor] great, we'll work together to find the best treatment plan for you. if you have any further questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out.","[doctor] hi there! soo.. i see from your chart that you've been experiencing seizures. can you tell me a bit more about that?

"PROCEDURE:
A 21-channel digital electroencephalogram was performed on a patient in the awake state.  Per the technician's notes, the patient is taking Depakene.
The recording consists of symmetric 9 Hz alpha activity.  Throughout the recording, repetitive episodes of bursts of 3 per second spike and wave activity are noted.  The episodes last from approximately1 to 7 seconds.  The episodes are exacerbated by hyperventilation.
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal electroencephalogram with repetitive bursts of 3 per second spike and wave activity exacerbated by hyperventilation.  This activity could represent true petit mal epilepsy.  Clinical correlation is suggested.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, i'm feeling okay, thanks.
[doctor] i have reviewed the results of your recent electroencephalogram, and i have some concerns. the test showed that you have a type of abnormal activity in your brain called ""bursts of 3 per second spike and wave activity."" this can be a sign of a type of epilepsy called petit mal epilepsy. have you ever had seizures or been diagnosed with epilepsy before?
[patient] no, i've never had any seizures or been diagnosed with epilepsy.
[doctor] okay, well we will need to do further testing and evaluations to make sure that this is indeed the case. the technician noted that you are taking depakene, which is a medication used to treat seizures. have you been taking it regularly?
[patient] yes, i have been taking it regularly.
[doctor] good, that's important. we will need to do more testing to confirm the diagnosis of petit mal epilepsy, but in the meantime, i want you to be careful and avoid any activities that could be dangerous if you were to have a seizure.

"EXAM:
Two views of the soft tissues of the neck.
HISTORY:
Patient has swelling of the left side of his neck.
TECHNIQUE:
Frontal and lateral views of the soft tissues of the neck were evaluated. There were no soft tissues of the neck radiographs for comparison. However, there was an ultrasound of the neck performed on the same day.
FINDINGS:
Frontal and lateral views of the soft tissues of the neck were evaluated and reveal there is an asymmetry seen to the left-sided soft tissues of the patient's neck which appear somewhat enlarged when compared to patient's right side. However the trachea appears to be normal caliber and contour.  Lateral views show a patent airway. The adenoids and tonsils appear normal caliber without evidence of hypertrophy. Airway appears patent. Osseous structures appear grossly normal.
IMPRESSION:
1. Patent airway. No evidence of any soft tissue swelling involving the patient's adenoids/tonsils, epiglottis or aryepiglottic folds. No evidence of any prevertebral soft tissue swelling.
2. Slight asymmetry seen to the soft tissues of the left side of the patient's neck which appears somewhat larger when compared to the right side.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i’m good, but i’ve noticed some swelling on the left side of my neck and i was hoping you could take a look at it.

[patient] no, i don't feel any pain, but it’s been there for a few days and it’s making me a little anxious.
[doctor] i understand. i'll start by performing an examination of your neck. i’ll also order some tests to figure out what's causing the swelling. we’ll start with an ultrasound of the neck. i’ll also order two views of the soft tissues of your neck to get a better look.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] the results of your tests are in. the ultrasound of your neck shows no evidence of soft tissue swelling. however, the two views of your neck show asymmetry to the left-sided soft tissues of your neck, which appear somewhat enlarged when compared to the right side. i also noted that the trachea appears to be normal caliber and contour. your adenoids and tonsils appear normal without any evidence of hypertrophy. your airway is patent and the osseous structures appear grossly normal. 
[patient] what does that mean exactly?
[doctor] it means that there is some swelling on the left side of your neck compared to the right side. however, it doesn't seem to be affecting your trachea, adenoids, or tonsils. your airway is patent, which means it’s open and unobstructed.
[patient] so what could be causing the swelling?
[doctor] there are many potential causes of neck swelling. some possible causes include an enlarged lymph node, an infection, or a growth. we'll need to further investigate to determine the exact cause.
[patient] what are my treatment options?
[doctor] it's hard to say exactly what the treatment will be until we determine the underlying cause of your swelling. depending on the cause, treatment options may include antibiotics, surgery, or observation.

"REASON FOR EXAM:
Pregnant female with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
FINDINGS:
The uterus measures 8.6 x 4.4 x 5.4 cm and contains a gestational sac with double decidual sac sign.  A yolk sac is visualized.  What appears to represent a crown-rump length measures 3.3 mm for an estimated sonographic age of 6 weeks 0 days and estimated date of delivery of 09/28/09.
Please note however that no fetal heart tones are seen.  However, fetal heart tones would be expected at this age.
The right ovary measures 3.1 x 1.6 x 2.3 cm.  The left ovary measures 3.3 x 1.9 x 3.5 cm.  No free fluid is detected.
IMPRESSION:
Single intrauterine pregnancy at 6 weeks 0 days with an estimated date of delivery of 09/28/09.  A live intrauterine pregnancy, however, could not be confirmed, as a sonographic fetal heart rate would be expected at this time.  A close interval followup in correlation with beta-hCG is necessary as findings may represent an inevitable abortion.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, i'm feeling terrible. i've been having nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea for a few days now.
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that. how many weeks pregnant are you?
[patient] i'm six weeks pregnant.
[doctor] alright, i see. we did an ultrasound and it shows a gestational sac with a yolk sac, but we couldn't detect a fetal heartbeat at this stage. it's possible that this might indicate an inevitable abortion, but we will need to do a follow-up ultrasound to be certain. 
[patient] oh no, what does that mean?
[doctor] it means that the pregnancy may not continue to a full-term delivery. we will need to keep an eye on it and monitor your beta-hcg levels to see if the pregnancy is viable or not. 
[patient] okay, what do i do in the meantime?
[doctor] we will need to schedule a follow-up ultrasound and do some blood tests to check your hormone levels. it's important to stay hydrated and get plenty of rest. if you experience any heavy bleeding or severe abdominal pain, please come back to the clinic right away. 
[patient] alright, i understand. thank you for explaining everything to me.

"EXAM:
Ultrasound of pelvis.
HISTORY:
Menorrhagia.
FINDINGS:
Uterus is enlarged measuring 11.0 x 7.5 x 11.0 cm.  It appears to be completely replaced by multiple ill-defined fibroids.  The endometrial echo complex was not visualized due to the contents of replacement of the uterus with fibroids.  The right ovary measures 3.9 x 1.9 x 2.3 cm.  The left ovary is not seen.  No complex cystic adnexal masses are identified.
IMPRESSION:
Essential replacement of the uterus by fibroids.  It is difficult to measure given their heterogenous and diffuse nature.  MRI of the pelvis could be performed for further evaluation to evaluate for possible uterine fibroid embolization.","[doctor] hi! how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi! i am doing fine, thank you.
[doctor] so, i have looked at your recent test results and it looks like you are experiencing menorrhagia. i also noticed that you had an ultrasound of the pelvis, which showed that your uterus is enlarged and there are multiple ill-defined fibroids that have replaced it. unfortunately, the endometrial echo complex was not visible due to the fibroids.
[patient] oh, what does that mean?
[doctor] well, it means that the fibroids have essentially replaced your uterus and it is difficult to measure them due to their size and diffuse nature. we may need to perform an mri of your pelvis for further evaluation to see if uterine fibroid embolization is an option.
[patient] okay, what does that entail?
[doctor] uterine fibroid embolization is a minimally invasive procedure that can help manage the symptoms of fibroids. it involves blocking the blood flow to the fibroids, which can cause them to shrink and alleviate the symptoms associated with them. however, we would need to perform additional tests to confirm if you are a good candidate for it.
[patient] i see. is there anything else i can do to help manage my symptoms?
[doctor] yes, there are a few options. we can start with some medications to help control the bleeding and manage the pain associated with the fibroids. we can also discuss some lifestyle changes that may help, such as increasing your physical activity and reducing your stress levels.
[patient] okay, that sounds like a good start.
[doctor] great. let's schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss your options further and come up with a treatment plan that works best for you.","[doctor] hi! how are you feeling today?

Transvaginal ultrasound.
HISTORY:
Pelvic pain.
FINDINGS:
The right ovary measures 1.6 x 3.4 x 2.0 cm.  There are several simple-appearing probable follicular cysts. There is no abnormal flow to suggest torsion on the right.  Left ovary is enlarged, demonstrating a 6.0 x 3.5 x 3.7 cm complex cystic mass of uncertain etiology.  This could represent a large hemorrhagic cyst versus abscess.  There is no evidence for left ovarian torsion.  There is a small amount of fluid in the cul-de-sac likely physiologic.
The uterus measures 7.7 x 5.0 cm.  The endometrial echo is normal at 6 mm.
IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence for torsion.
2.  Large, complex cystic left ovarian mass as described.  This could represent a large hemorrhagic cyst; however, an abscess/neoplasm cannot be excluded.  Recommend either short interval followup versus laparoscopic evaluation given the large size and complex nature.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, i'm not feeling good. i have pelvic pain.
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that. based on your medical notes, we did a transvaginal ultrasound and found that there is a complex cystic left ovarian mass which could either be a large hemorrhagic cyst or abscess/neoplasm. we would recommend laparoscopic evaluation due to its size and complex nature. how do you feel about that?
[patient] i'm not sure, what does that involve?
[doctor] it's a surgical procedure where a small incision is made to insert a laparoscope to examine the inside of the abdomen and remove the ovarian mass if necessary. it's done under general anesthesia.

"EXAM:
AP abdomen and ultrasound of kidney.
HISTORY:
Ureteral stricture.
AP ABDOMEN
FINDINGS:
Comparison is made to study from Month DD, YYYY.  There is a left lower quadrant ostomy.  There are no dilated bowel loops suggesting obstruction.  There is a double-J right ureteral stent, which appears in place.  There are several pelvic calcifications, which are likely vascular.  No definite pathologic calcifications are seen overlying the regions of the kidneys or obstructing course of the ureters.  Overall findings are stable versus most recent exam.
IMPRESSION:
Properly positioned double-J right ureteral stent.  No evidence for calcified renal or ureteral stones.
ULTRASOUND KIDNEYS,FINDINGS:
The right kidney is normal in cortical echogenicity of solid mass, stone, hydronephrosis measuring 9.0 x 2.9 x 4.3 cm.  There is a right renal/ureteral stent identified.  There is no perinephric fluid collection.
The left kidney demonstrates moderate-to-severe hydronephrosis.  No stone or solid masses seen.  The cortex is normal.
The bladder is decompressed.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Left-sided hydronephrosis.
2.  No visible renal or ureteral calculi.
3.  Right ureteral stent.","[doctor] hi there! how can i help you today?
[patient] hi, doctor. i have been diagnosed with ureteral stricture, and i had an ap abdomen and ultrasound of the kidney done recently.
[doctor] okay, let me take a look at the report. it shows that your right kidney is normal and that there is a double-j right ureteral stent in place, which is good. the left kidney, though, shows moderate-to-severe hydronephrosis, which means there is swelling due to urine backup. they did not see any visible renal or ureteral stones. 
[patient] okay, but what can we do about the hydronephrosis?
[doctor] there are a few options we can consider. one is to remove the ureteral stricture, depending on the severity and location. another option is to place a stent in the left ureter to allow urine to drain more easily. but before we decide on anything, i would like to order a ct scan or an mri to get a better look at the anatomy and make sure there is no other obstruction causing the hydronephrosis.
[patient] okay, that makes sense. what about the calcifications that were seen?
[doctor] they appear to be vascular calcifications, which are common as we age and are usually not concerning. there were no definite pathologic calcifications seen overlying the regions of the kidneys or obstructing course of the ureters.
[patient] alright, thank you for explaining that. what's the next step?

"REASON FOR EXAM:
Coronary artery bypass surgery and aortic stenosis.
FINDINGS:
Transthoracic echocardiogram was performed of technically limited quality.  The left ventricle was normal in size and dimensions with normal LV function.  Ejection fraction was 50% to 55%.  Concentric hypertrophy noted with interventricular septum measuring 1.6 cm, posterior wall measuring 1.2 cm.  Left atrium is enlarged, measuring 4.42 cm.  Right-sided chambers are normal in size and dimensions.  Aortic root has normal diameter.
Mitral and tricuspid valve reveals annular calcification.  Fibrocalcific valve leaflets noted with adequate excursion.  Similar findings noted on the aortic valve as well with significantly adequate excursion of valve leaflets.  Atrial and ventricular septum are intact.  Pericardium is intact without any effusion.  No obvious intracardiac mass or thrombi noted.
Doppler study reveals mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation.  Severe aortic stenosis with peak velocity of 2.76 with calculated ejection fraction 50% to 55% with severe aortic stenosis.  There is also mitral stenosis.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle with left ventricular function.
2.  Moderate mitral regurgitation.
3.  Severe aortic stenosis, severe.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Transesophageal echocardiogram is clinically warranted to assess the aortic valve area.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] not so good, doctor. i'm feeling weak and tired all the time.
[doctor] i can understand. i have reviewed your medical reports and i see that you have a history of coronary artery bypass surgery and aortic stenosis. i would like to know more about your symptoms.
[patient] i have been feeling shortness of breath and chest pain recently. i also feel very tired and weak all the time.
[doctor] okay, based on your reports, i see that you had a transthoracic echocardiogram which showed some findings. your left ventricle is normal in size and dimensions with normal lv function. however, there is concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle with the interventricular septum measuring 1.6 cm and posterior wall measuring 1.2 cm. the left atrium is enlarged, measuring 4.42 cm. there is moderate mitral regurgitation and severe aortic stenosis with a peak velocity of 2.76. i recommend a transesophageal echocardiogram to assess the aortic valve area.
[patient] what does it mean by moderate mitral regurgitation and severe aortic stenosis?
[doctor] mitral regurgitation means that there is leakage of blood from the left ventricle to the left atrium. this can cause shortness of breath and fatigue. on the other hand, severe aortic stenosis means that the aortic valve is narrowed and obstructing the blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta. this can cause chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue.
[patient] what can be done to treat these conditions?
[doctor] it depends on the severity of the conditions. for severe aortic stenosis, we may have to perform an aortic valve replacement surgery. for moderate mitral regurgitation, we may have to monitor the condition closely or perform surgery to repair or replace the valve. i will recommend a transesophageal echocardiogram to assess the aortic valve area and evaluate the severity of the condition. we will then discuss the treatment options and make a plan accordingly.

[patient] well, i've been having chest pain and shortness of breath lately. plus, i'm just feeling really tired and weak all the time.
[doctor] alright, based on your reports, it seems like you had a transthoracic echocardiogram which gave us some results. your left ventricle is normal in size and dimensions with normal lv function. however, there is concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle with the interventricular septum measuring 1.6 cm and posterior wall measuring 1.2 cm. the left atrium is enlarged, measuring 4.42 cm. there is moderate mitral regurgitation and severe aortic stenosis with a peak velocity of 2.76. i think we should do a transesophageal echocardiogram to check the aortic valve area.
[patient] mm-hmm, can you explain what moderate mitral regurgitation and severe aortic stenosis mean?
[doctor] sure! mitral regurgitation means that blood is leaking from the left ventricle to the left atrium. this can cause shortness of breath and fatigue. severe aortic stenosis means that the aortic valve is narrowed and blocking the blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta. this can cause chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue.
[patient] got it. what kind of treatment is available for these conditions?
[doctor] it depends on how severe the conditions are. for severe aortic stenosis, we may have to perform an aortic valve replacement surgery. for moderate mitral regurgitation, we may have to monitor the condition closely or perform surgery to repair or replace the valve. i think we should do a transesophageal echocardiogram to check the aortic valve area and see how severe the condition is. after that, we can discuss treatment options and make a plan.

REASON FOR EXAM:
Elevated liver function tests.

INTERPRETATION:
The liver demonstrates heterogeneously increased echotexture with significant fatty infiltration.  The gallbladder is surgically absent. There is no fluid collection in the cholecystectomy bed.  There is dilatation of the common bile duct up to 1 cm.  There is also dilatation of the pancreatic duct that measures up to 3 mm.  There is caliectasis in the right kidney.  The bladder is significantly distended measuring 937 cc in volume.  The caliectasis in the right kidney may be secondary to back pressure from the distended bladder.  The aorta is normal in caliber.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Dilated common duct as well as pancreatic duct as described.  Given the dilatation of these two ducts, ERCP versus MRCP is recommended to exclude obstructing mass.  The findings could reflect changes of cholecystectomy.

[doctor] i see. well, i have good news for you. the x-ray of your right ankle came back negative. that means there are no fractures or dislocations, and there are no significant degenerative changes or destructive osseous lesions of your ankle. however, there is a small plantar calcaneal spur, which is a bony growth on the bottom of your heel.
[patient] oh, okay. so, what does this mean for my ankle pain?
[doctor] it means that the cause of your pain is not due to any serious damage or injury to your ankle. it could be due to inflammation or a strain. we can start by treating the pain with some over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. we can also try some physical therapy to help strengthen the muscles around your ankle and reduce the pain.
[patient] okay. that sounds good. thank you, doctor.
[doctor] you're welcome. let's schedule a follow-up appointment to see how you're doing with the pain management plan we discussed.","[doctor] hey! how's it going today?

"INDICATIONS:
Chest pain.
PROCEDURE DONE:
Graded exercise treadmill stress test.
STRESS ECG RESULTS:
The patient was stressed by continuous graded treadmill testing for nine minutes of the standard Bruce protocol.  The heart rate increased from 68 beats per minute to 178 beats per minute, which is 100% of the maximum predicted target heart rate.  The blood pressure increased from 120/70 to 130/80.  The baseline resting electrocardiogram reveals a regular sinus rhythm.  The tracing is within normal limits.  Symptoms of chest pain occurred with exercise.  The pain persisted during the recovery process and was aggravated by deep inspiration.  Marked chest wall tenderness noted.  There were no ischemic ST segment changes seen during exercise or during the recovery process.
CONCLUSIONS,:
1.  Stress test is negative for ischemia.
2.  Chest wall tenderness occurred with exercise.
3.  Blood pressure response to exercise is normal.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, doctor. i'm feeling okay, just a little worried about the chest pain i've been experiencing.
[doctor] i understand. that's why we did the stress test, which i have the results for. it shows that there were no signs of ischemia, which is great news. 
[patient] that's a relief. so what could be causing the chest pain then?
[doctor] well, during the test, we did notice that you had marked chest wall tenderness, which means the pain is likely coming from the muscles and tissues in your chest wall rather than from your heart. it's possible that you may have strained or injured those muscles somehow.
[patient] oh, i see. is there anything i can do to alleviate the pain?
[doctor] yes, you can try taking an over-the-counter pain reliever like ibuprofen, and applying a heating pad or ice pack to the affected area. it's also important to avoid any activities that may aggravate the pain or put strain on your chest wall muscles.
[patient] okay, i'll definitely try that. is there anything else i should know from the stress test results?
[doctor] yes, your blood pressure response to exercise was normal, which is a good sign. overall, the stress test results showed no evidence of heart disease or any other issues. if you continue to experience chest pain, we can look into other possible causes and treatments, but for now, it seems to be related to your chest wall muscles.

"INDICATIONS:
Chest pain, hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus.
PROCEDURE DONE:
Dobutamine Myoview stress test.
STRESS ECG RESULTS:
The patient was stressed by dobutamine infusion at a rate of 10 mcg/kg/minute for three minutes, 20 mcg/kg/minute for three minutes, and 30 mcg/kg/minute for three additional minutes.  Atropine 0.25 mg was given intravenously eight minutes into the dobutamine infusion.  The resting electrocardiogram reveals a regular sinus rhythm with heart rate of 86 beats per minute, QS pattern in leads V1 and V2, and diffuse nonspecific T wave abnormality.  The heart rate increased from 86 beats per minute to 155 beats per minute, which is about 90% of the maximum predicted target heart rate.  The blood pressure increased from 130/80 to 160/70.  A maximum of 1 mm J-junctional depression was seen with fast up sloping ST segments during dobutamine infusion.  No ischemic ST segment changes were seen during dobutamine infusion or during the recovery process.
MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION IMAGING:
Resting myocardial perfusion SPECT imaging was carried out with 10.9 mCi of Tc-99m Myoview.  Dobutamine infusion myocardial perfusion imaging and gated scan were carried out with 29.2 mCi of Tc-99m Myoview.  The lung heart ratio is 0.36.  Myocardial perfusion images were normal both at rest and with stress.  Gated myocardial scan revealed normal regional wall motion and ejection fraction of 67%.

This 51 y/o RHM was moving furniture several days prior to presentation when he struck his head (vertex) against a door panel. He then stepped back and struck his back on a trailer hitch. There was no associated LOC but he felt ""dazed."" He complained a HA since the accident. The following day he began experiencing episodic vertigo lasting several minutes with associated nausea and vomiting. He has been lying in bed most of the time since the accident. He also complained of transient left lower extremity weakness. The night before admission he went to his bedroom and his girlfriend heard a loud noise. She found him on the floor unable to speak or move his left side well. He was taken to a local ER. In the ER experienced a spell in which he stared to the right for approximately one minute. During this time he was unable to speak and did not seem to comprehend verbal questions. This resolved. ER staff noted decreased left sided movement and a left Babinski sign.
He was given valium 5 mg, and DPH 1.0g. A HCT was performed and he was transferred to UIHC.
PMH:
DM, Coronary Artery Disease, Left femoral neuropathy of unknown etiology. Multiple head trauma in past (?falls/fights).
MEDS:
unknown oral med for DM.
SHX:
10+pack-year h/o Tobacco use; quit 2 years ago. 6-pack beer/week. No h/o illicit drug use.
FHX:
unknown.

CN: left lower facial weakness with right gaze preference. Pupils 3/3 decreasing to 2/2 on exposure to light. Optic disks flat.
MOTOR: decreased spontaneous movement of left-sided extremities. 5/4 strength in both upper and lower extremities. Normal muscle tone and bulk.
SENSORY: withdrew equally to noxious stimulation in all four extremities. GAIT/STATION/COORDINATION: not tested.
The general physical exam was unremarkable.
During the exam the patient experienced a spell during which his head turned and eyes deviated to the leftward, and his right hand twitched. The entire spell lasted one minute.
During the episode he was verbally unresponsive. He appeared groggy and lethargic after the event.
HCT without contrast: 11/18/92: right frontal skull fracture with associated minimal epidural hematoma and small subdural hematoma, as well as some adjacent subarachnoid blood and brain contusion.
LABS:
CBC, GS, PT/PTT were all WNL.
COURSE:
The patient was diagnosed with a right frontal SAH/contusion and post traumatic seizures. DPH was continued and he was given a Librium taper for possible alcoholic withdrawal. A neurosurgical consult was obtained. He did not receive surgical intervention and was discharged 12/1/92. Neuropsychological testing on 11/25/92 revealed: poor orientation to time or place and poor attention. Anterograde verbal and visual memory was severely impaired. Speech became mildly dysarthric when fatigued. Defective word finding. Difficulty copying 2 of 3 three dimensional figures. Recent head injury as well as a history of ETOH abuse and multiple prior head injuries probably contribute to his deficits.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?

"EXAM:
Single frontal view of the chest.
HISTORY:
Atelectasis.  Patient is status-post surgical correction for ASD.
TECHNIQUE:
A single frontal view of the chest was evaluated and correlated with the prior film dated mm/dd/yy.
FINDINGS:
Current film reveals there is a right-sided central venous catheter, the distal tip appears to be in the superior vena cava.  Endotracheal tube with the distal tip appears to be in appropriate position, approximately 2 cm superior to the carina.  Sternotomy wires are noted.  They appear in appropriate placement.  There are no focal areas of consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Once again seen is minimal amount of bilateral basilar atelectasis.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears to be within normal limits at this time.  No evidence of any pneumothoraces or pleural effusions.
IMPRESSION:
1.  There has been interval placement of a right-sided central venous catheter, endotracheal tube, and sternotomy wires secondary to patient's most recent surgical intervention.
2.  Minimal bilateral basilar atelectasis with no significant interval changes from the patient's most recent prior.

"EXAM:
Single frontal view of the chest.
HISTORY:
Respiratory distress.  The patient has a history of malrotation.  The patient is back for a re-anastomosis of the bowel with no acute distress.
TECHNIQUE:
Single frontal view of the chest was evaluated and correlated with the prior film dated MM/DD/YY.
FINDINGS:
A single frontal view of the chest was evaluated.  It reveals interval placement of an ET tube and an NG tube.  ET tube is midway between the patient's thoracic inlet and carina.  NG tube courses with the distal tip in the left upper quadrant beneath the left hemidiaphragm.  There is no evidence of any focal areas of consolidation, pneumothoraces, or pleural effusions.  The mediastinum seen was slightly prominent; however, this may be secondary to thymus and/or technique.  There is a slight increase seen with regards to the central pulmonary vessels.  Again, this may represent a minimal amount of pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is paucity of bowel gas seen in the upper abdomen.  The osseous thorax appears to be grossly intact and symmetrical.  Slightly low lung volumes, however, this may be secondary to the film being taken on the expiratory phase of respiration.
IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of any focal areas of consolidation, pneumothoraces, or pleural effusions.
2.  Slight prominence to the mediastinum which may be secondary to thymus and/or technique.
3.  Slight prominence of some of the central pulmonary vasculature which may represent a minimal amount of vascular congestion.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i am feeling a bit uneasy, doctor. i am experiencing respiratory distress.
[doctor] i see. can you tell me about your medical history?
[patient] yes, i have a history of malrotation. i am here for a re-anastomosis of the bowel.
[doctor] alright, let me check your chest x-ray first. we ordered a single frontal view of the chest to check your respiratory system. the x-ray shows that your endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are properly placed. there is no sign of consolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion in your lungs. however, the mediastinum is slightly prominent which could be due to your thymus or the x-ray technique. we also observed a slight increase in the central pulmonary vessels which may indicate a minimal amount of vascular congestion. your upper abdomen also shows paucity of bowel gas. the osseous thorax appears to be intact and symmetrical, but there is a slightly low lung volume which could be due to the timing of the x-ray.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] based on this, i can say that there is no evidence of any significant respiratory issues. however, we need to monitor your condition closely. we may need to do further tests to make sure everything is alright. is there anything else that concerns you?
[patient] no, that's all.
[doctor] alright. i will prescribe some medications to help alleviate your respiratory distress. also, let's schedule a follow-up exam to check your condition.","[doctor] hey there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] um, i'm feeling a bit uneasy, doctor. i'm having trouble breathing.

"EXAM:
Nuclear medicine tumor localization, whole body.
HISTORY:
Status post subtotal thyroidectomy for thyroid carcinoma, histology not provided.
FINDINGS:
Following the oral administration of 4.3 mCi Iodine-131, whole body planar images were obtained in the anterior and posterior projections at 24, 48, and 72 hours.
There is increased uptake in the left upper quadrant, which persists throughout the examination.  There is a focus of increased activity in the right lower quadrant, which becomes readily apparent at 72 hours.  Physiologic uptake in the liver, spleen, and transverse colon is noted.  Physiologic urinary bladder uptake is also appreciated.  There is low-grade uptake in the oropharyngeal region.
IMPRESSION:
Iodine-avid foci in the right lower quadrant and left upper quadrant medially suspicious for distant metastasis.  Anatomical evaluation, i.e.
CT is advised to determine if there are corresponding mesenteric lesions.  Ultimately (provided that the original pathology of the thyroid tumor with iodine-avid) PET scanning may be necessary.  No evidence of iodine added locoregional metastasis.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?

[doctor] the test showed increased uptake in the left upper quadrant and a focus of increased activity in the right lower quadrant that became more noticeable at 72 hours. the report suggests that these areas are suspicious for distant metastasis.
[patient] what does that mean for me?
[doctor] well, further testing is needed to determine if there are mesenteric lesions that correspond with the iodine-avid foci. i recommend that we proceed with a ct scan to get a better look at these areas. additionally, if the original pathology of the thyroid tumor shows iodine-avid, a pet scan may be necessary in the future.
[patient] okay, what does this mean for my treatment plan?
[doctor] at this time, we need to determine the extent of the metastasis before we can develop a treatment plan. the good news is that there is no evidence of iodine added locoregional metastasis, meaning the cancer has not spread to nearby tissues. we will need to gather more information to determine the best course of action moving forward.

"MEDICATIONS:
Plavix, atenolol, Lipitor, and folic acid.
CLINICAL HISTORY:
This is a 41-year-old male patient who comes in with chest pain, had had a previous MI in 07/2003 and stents placement in 2003, who comes in for a stress myocardial perfusion scan.
With the patient at rest, 10.3 mCi of Cardiolite technetium-99 m sestamibi was injected and myocardial perfusion imaging was obtained.
PROCEDURE AND INTERPRETATION:
The patient exercised for a total of 12 minutes on the standard Bruce protocol.  The peak workload was 12.8 METS.  The resting heart rate was 57 beats per minute and the peak heart rate was 123 beats per minute, which was 69% of the age-predicted maximum heart rate response.  The blood pressure response was normal with a resting blood pressure of 130/100 and a peak blood pressure of 158/90.  The test was stopped due to fatigue and leg pain.  EKG at rest showed normal sinus rhythm.  The peak stress EKG did not reveal any ischemic ST-T wave abnormalities.  There was ventricular bigeminy seen during exercise, but no sustained tachycardia was seen.  At peak, there was no chest pain noted.  The test was stopped due to fatigue and left pain.  At peak stress, the patient was injected with 30.3 mCi of Cardiolite technetium-99 m sestamibi and myocardial perfusion imaging was obtained, and was compared to resting myocardial perfusion imaging.
MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION IMAGING:
1.  The overall quality of the scan was good.
2.  There was no diagnostic abnormality on the rest and stress myocardial perfusion imaging.
3.  The left ventricular cavity appeared normal in size.
4.  Gated SPECT images revealed mild septal hypokinesis and mild apical hypokinesis.  Overall left ventricular systolic function was low normal with calculated ejection fraction of 46% at rest.
CONCLUSIONS:
1.  Good exercise tolerance.
2.  Less than adequate cardiac stress.  The patient was on beta-blocker therapy.
3.  No EKG evidence of stress induced ischemia.
4.  No chest pain with stress.
5.  Mild ventricular bigeminy with exercise.
6.  No diagnostic abnormality on the rest and stress myocardial perfusion imaging.
7.  Gated SPECT images revealed septal and apical hypokinesis with overall low normal left ventricular systolic function with calculated ejection fraction of 46% at rest.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i am doing okay, thanks for asking.
[doctor] i reviewed your test results and everything looks okay, but i want to discuss them with you just to make sure you understand everything. how have you been feeling lately?
[patient] i have been having some chest pains, that's why i came here.
[doctor] right, well your stress myocardial perfusion scan came back with no diagnostic abnormality on the rest and stress myocardial perfusion imaging, which is good news. however, the scan did reveal mild septal hypokinesis and mild apical hypokinesis. 
[patient] what does that mean?
[doctor] that means that there is some reduced movement in the walls of your heart, specifically the septum and the apex. your overall left ventricular systolic function was low normal with calculated ejection fraction of 46% at rest. this is something we will want to monitor.
[patient] what can i do to improve this?
[doctor] since you are already on plavix, atenolol, lipitor, and folic acid, which are all good medications for your heart, there isn't much more you can do at this time. we will want to continue monitoring your heart function and possibly adjust your medications as needed.

"CLINICAL HISTORY:
This is a 64-year-old male patient, who had a previous stress test, which was abnormal and hence has been referred for a stress test with imaging for further classification of coronary artery disease and ischemia.
PERTINENT MEDICATIONS:
Include Tylenol, Robitussin, Colace, Fosamax, multivitamins, hydrochlorothiazide, Protonix and flaxseed oil.
With the patient at rest 10.5 mCi of Cardiolite technetium-99 m sestamibi was injected and myocardial perfusion imaging was obtained.
PROCEDURE AND INTERPRETATION:
The patient exercised for a total of 4 minutes and 41 seconds on the standard Bruce protocol.  The peak workload was 7 METs.  The resting heart rate was 61 beats per minute and the peak heart rate was 173 beats per minute, which was 85% of the age-predicted maximum heart rate response.  The blood pressure response was normal with the resting blood pressure 126/86, and the peak blood pressure of 134/90.  EKG at rest showed normal sinus rhythm with a right-bundle branch block.  The peak stress EKG was abnormal with 2 mm of ST segment depression in V3 to V6, which remained abnormal till about 6 to 8 minutes into recovery.  There were occasional PVCs, but no sustained arrhythmia.  The patient had an episode of supraventricular tachycardia at peak stress.  The ischemic threshold was at a heart rate of 118 beats per minute and at 4.6 METs.  At peak stress, the patient was injected with 30.3 mCi of Cardiolite technetium-99 m sestamibi and myocardial perfusion imaging was obtained, and was compared to resting images.
MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION IMAGING:
1.  The overall quality of the scan was fair in view of increased abdominal uptake, increased bowel uptake seen.
2.  There was a large area of moderate to reduced tracer concentration seen in the inferior wall and the inferior apex.  This appeared to be partially reversible in the resting images.
3.  The left ventricle appeared normal in size.
4.  Gated SPECT images revealed normal wall motion and normal left ventricular systolic function with normal wall thickening.  The calculated ejection fraction was 70% at rest.
CONCLUSIONS:
1.  Average exercise tolerance.
2.  Adequate cardiac stress.
3.  Abnormal EKG response to stress, consistent with ischemia.  No symptoms of chest pain at rest.
4.  Myocardial perfusion imaging was abnormal with a large-sized, moderate intensity partially reversible inferior wall and inferior apical defect, consistent with inferior wall ischemia and inferior apical ischemia.
5.  The patient had run of SVT at peak stress.
6.  Gated SPECT images revealed normal wall motion and normal left ventricular systolic function.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm doing well, thanks for asking.
[doctor] great! so, we got your results back from the stress test with imaging. it looks like you had an abnormal ekg response to stress, consistent with ischemia. can you tell me if you experienced any chest pain during the test?
[patient] no, i didn't experience any chest pain.
[doctor] okay, good to know. the myocardial perfusion imaging was also abnormal, showing a large-sized, moderate intensity partially reversible inferior wall and inferior apical defect, indicating that you have inferior wall ischemia and inferior apical ischemia. did you have any questions about what that means?
[patient] yes, what does that mean exactly?
[doctor] basically, it means that the blood flow to your heart muscle is reduced, which can lead to chest pain and other symptoms. we'll need to do some more tests to determine the severity and extent of the ischemia, but it's important that we address this issue to prevent any further damage to your heart. 
[patient] okay, what are the next steps?
[doctor] well, we'll need to refer you to a cardiologist to further evaluate your condition. they may recommend additional tests, such as a coronary angiogram, to get a better look at your heart and determine the best course of treatment. in the meantime, i would advise you to continue taking your medications as prescribed and avoid any strenuous activity until we can get a better understanding of your condition.

"CC:
Found unresponsive.
HX:
39 y/o RHF complained of a severe HA at 2AM 11/4/92. It was unclear whether she had been having HA prior to this. She took an unknown analgesic, then vomited, then lay down in bed with her husband. When her husband awoke at 8AM he found her unresponsive with ""stiff straight arms"" and a ""strange breathing pattern."" A Brain CT scan revealed a large intracranial mass. She was intubated and hyperventilated to ABG (7.43/36/398). Other local lab values included: WBC 9.8, RBC 3.74, Hgb 13.8, Hct 40.7, Cr 0.5, BUN 8.5, Glucose 187, Na 140, K 4.0, Cl 107. She was given Mannitol 1gm/kg IV load, DPH 20mg/kg IV load, and transferred by helicopter to UIHC.

EXAM:
35.8F, 99BPM, BP117/72, Mechanically ventilated at a rate of 22RPM on !00%FiO2. Unresponsive to verbal stimulation. CN: Pupils 7mm/5mm and unresponsive to light (fixed). No spontaneous eye movement or blink to threat. No papilledema or intraocular hemorrhage noted. Trace corneal reflexes bilaterally. No gag reflex. No oculocephalic reflex. MOTOR/SENSORY: No spontaneous movement. On noxious stimulation (Deep nail bed pressure) she either extended both upper extremities (RUE>LUE), or withdrew the stimulated extremity (right > left). Gait/Station/Coordination no tested. Reflexes: 1+ on right and 2+ on left with bilateral Babinski signs.
HCT 11/4/92: Large heterogeneous mass in the right temporal-parietal region causing significant parenchymal distortion and leftward subfalcine effect . There is low parenchymal density within the white matter. A hyperdense ring lies peripherally and may represent hemorrhage or calcification. The mass demonstrates inhomogeneous enhancement with contrast.
COURSE:
Head of bed elevated to 30 degrees, Mannitol and DPH were continued. MRI of Brain demonstrated a large right parietal mass with necrotic appearing center and leftward shift of midline structures. She underwent surgical resection of the tumor. Pathological analysis was consistent with adenocarcinoma. GYN exam, CT Abdomen and Pelvis, Bone scan were unremarkable. CXR revealed an right upper lobe lung nodule. She did not undergo thoracic biopsy due to poor condition. She received 3000 cGy cranial XRT in ten fractions and following this was discharged to a rehabilitation center.
In March, 1993 the patient exhibited right ptosis, poor adduction and abduction OD, 4/4 strength in the upper extremities and 5-/5- strength in the lower extremities. She was ambulatory with an ataxic gait.
She was admitted on 7/12/93 for lower cervical and upper thoracic pain, paraparesis and T8 sensory level. MRI brainstem/spine on that day revealed decreased T1 signal in the C2, C3, C6 vertebral bodies, increased T2 signal in the anterior medulla, and tectum, and spinal cord (C7-T3). Following injection of Gadolinium there was diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement from C7-T7 These findings were felt consistent with metastatic disease including possible leptomeningeal spread. Neurosurgery and Radiation Oncology agreed that the patients symptoms could be due to either radiation injury and/or metastasis. The patient was treated with Decadron and analgesics and discharged to a hospice center (her choice). She died a few months later.","[doctor] hello, how are you today?

[patient] um, i'm doing alright, thanks for asking.
[doctor] so, i was looking at your medical history and saw that you had an episode where you were unresponsive. can you give me some more details about what went down?
[patient] yeah, so i had this really bad headache and took some pain meds that i didn't know much about. then i started vomiting and couldn't move my arms or breathe normally. my husband found me and i was rushed to the hospital, where they found a big mass in my brain.
[doctor] dang, that sounds rough. what did they do to treat the mass?
[patient] i got some mannitol and dph, and was transferred to uihc for surgery. they removed the tumor and found out that it was adenocarcinoma. afterwards, i got some cranial xrt and was sent to a rehab center.
[doctor] wow, that's a lot to go through. did you have any other symptoms after that?
[patient] yeah, in march of '93, i had some issues with my eyes and arms, and had trouble walking too.
[doctor] got it. and when you were admitted in july of '93, what kind of symptoms did you have then?
[patient] i had a lot of pain in my neck and upper back, and my legs were weak too. i couldn't really feel anything below my chest.
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that. what did the tests show at that time?
[patient] the mri showed some weird signals in my spinal cord and some of my vertebrae. they thought it might be cancer that had spread, maybe even to my meninges.

MRI OF THE LEFT KNEE WITHOUT CONTRAST,CLINICAL:
Left knee pain. Twisting injury.
FINDINGS:
The images reveal a sizable joint effusion. The joint effusion appears to be complex with mixed signal intensity material within. The patella is slightly laterally tilted towards the left. The mid portion of the patella cartilage shows some increased signal and focal injury to the patellar cartilage is suspected. Mildly increased bone signal overlying the inferolateral portion of the patella is identified. No significant degenerative changes about the patella can be seen. The quadriceps tendon as well as the infrapatellar ligament both look intact. There is some prepatellar soft tissue edema.
The bone signal shows a couple of small areas of cystic change in the proximal aspect of the tibia. NO significant areas of bone edema are appreciated.
There is soft tissue edema along the lateral aspect of the knee. There is a partial tear of the lateral collateral ligament complex. The medial collateral ligament complex looks intact. A small amount of edema is identified immediately adjacent to the medial collateral ligament complex.
The posterior cruciate ligament looks intact. The anterior cruciate ligament is thickened with significant increased signal. I suspect at least a high grade partial tear.
The posterior horn of the medial meniscus shows some myxoid degenerative changes. The posterior horn and anterior horn of the lateral meniscus likewise shows myxoid degenerative type changes. I don’t see a definite tear extending to the articular surface.
IMPRESSION:
Sizeable joint effusion which is complex and may contain blood products.
Myxoid degenerative type changes medial and lateral meniscus with no definite evidence of a tear.
Soft tissue swelling and partial tear of the lateral collateral ligament complex.
At least high grade partial tear of the anterior cruciate ligament with significant thickening and increased signal of this structure.
The posterior cruciate ligament is intact.
Injury to the patellar cartilage as above.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?

[doctor] i understand. we performed an mri on your left knee and found a few things. firstly, we found a sizable joint effusion, which is a collection of fluid within the joint. we also found some myxoid degenerative changes in the medial and lateral meniscus, which means there is some wear and tear on those areas, but we did not see any definite tears. additionally, there is soft tissue swelling and a partial tear of the lateral collateral ligament complex, which is a ligament on the outside of the knee. finally, we found a high-grade partial tear of your anterior cruciate ligament and an injury to your patellar cartilage.
[patient] oh wow, that sounds serious.
[doctor] yes, it is a significant injury. we will need to develop a treatment plan to address it. first, i recommend rest, ice, compression and elevation of your knee to reduce the swelling. i can also prescribe pain medication if you're experiencing discomfort. additionally, we may need to perform surgery to address the tears in your ligament and cartilage. we can discuss this in more detail after you’ve had a chance to rest your knee and the swelling has gone down.

MRI RIGHT KNEE WITHOUT GADOLINIUM,CLINICAL:
This is a 21-year-old male with right knee pain after a twisting injury on 7/31/05. Patient has had prior lateral meniscectomy in 2001.
FINDINGS:
Examination was performed on 8/3/05,Normal medial meniscus without intrasubstance degeneration, surface fraying or discrete meniscal tear.
There is subtle irregularity along the superior and inferior articular surfaces of the lateral meniscus, likely reflecting previous partial meniscectomy and contouring, although subtle surface tearing cannot be excluded, particularly along the undersurface of the lateral meniscus (series #3, image #17). There is no displaced tear or displaced meniscal fragment.
There is a mild interstitial sprain of the anterior cruciate ligament without focal tear or discontinuity.
Normal posterior cruciate ligament.
Normal medial collateral ligament.
There is a strain of the popliteus muscle and tendon without complete tear.
There is a sprain of the posterolateral and posterocentral joint capsule (series #5 images #10-18). There is marrow edema within the posterolateral corner of the tibia, and there is linear signal adjacent to the cortex suggesting that there may be a Segond fracture for which correlation with radiographs is recommended (series #6, images #4-7).
Biceps femoris tendon and iliotibial band are intact and there is no discrete fibular collateral ligament tear. Normal quadriceps and patellar tendons.
There is contusion within the posterior non-weight bearing surface of the medial femoral condyle, as well as in the posteromedial corner of the tibia. There is linear vertically oriented signal within the distal tibial diaphyseal-metaphyseal junction (series #7, image #8; series #2, images #4-5). There is no discrete fracture line, and this is of uncertain significance, but this should be correlated with radiographs.
The patellofemoral joint is congruent without patellar tilt or subluxation. Normal medial and lateral patellar retinacula. There is a joint effusion.
IMPRESSION:
Changes within the lateral meniscus most likely reflect previous partial meniscectomy and re-contouring although a subtle undersurface tear in the anterior horn may be present.
Mild anterior cruciate ligament interstitial sprain.
There is a strain of the popliteus muscle and tendon and there is a sprain of the posterolateral and posterocentral joint capsule with a possible Second fracture which should be correlated with radiographs.
","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, i am okay, but i am still experiencing pain in my right knee.
[doctor] i see, let's take a look at your mri results. it shows that you have changes in the lateral meniscus most likely due to the previous partial meniscectomy and re-contouring. however, a subtle undersurface tear in the anterior horn may be present. you also have a mild anterior cruciate ligament interstitial sprain, a strain of the popliteus muscle and tendon, and a sprain of the posterolateral and posterocentral joint capsule. there is a possible segond fracture which should be confirmed by radiographs. 
[patient] okay, so what does this mean for me?
[doctor] it means that you have some injuries in your knee, but they are not severe. we can manage your pain with some medication and physical therapy.
[patient] do i need surgery?
[doctor] at this time, surgery is not necessary. we can try some conservative treatments first and see how they work for you.
[patient] okay, what kind of medication do you recommend?
[doctor] we can start with some over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. if those don't work, we can prescribe something stronger. 
[patient] and what about physical therapy?
[doctor] physical therapy can help to strengthen the muscles around your knee and improve your range of motion. it can also help to reduce your pain.
[patient] alright, i will try those treatments. thank you, doctor.

[patient] okay, what kind of medication do you recommend?
[doctor] we can start with some over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. if those don't work, we can prescribe something stronger. 
[patient] and what about physical therapy?
[doctor] physical therapy can help to strengthen the muscles around your knee and improve your range of motion. it can also help to reduce your pain.
[patient] alright, i will try those treatments. thank you, doctor.
[doctor] you're welcome. let's schedule a follow-up appointment to see how you're doing and if we need to adjust your treatment plan.",2

Pain and swelling in the right foot, peroneal tendon tear.
FINDINGS:
Contours of marrow signal patterns of the regional bones are within normal range treating there is increased T2 signal within the soft tissues at the lateral margin of the cuboid bone. A small effusion is noted within the peroneal tendon sheath. There is a 3mm slight separation of the distal tip of the peroneus longus tendon from the lateral margin of the cuboid bone, consistent with an avulsion. There is no sign of cuboid fracture. The fifth metatarsal base appears intact. The calcaneus is also normal in appearance.
IMPRESSION:
Findings consistent with an avulsion of the peroneus longus tendon from the insertion on the lateral aspect of cuboid bone.
","[doctor] hey there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi! i'm in a lot of pain and my right foot is swollen.
[doctor] i see. so, the mri shows that you have a tear in your peroneal tendon. here are the details: there is a slight separation of the distal tip of the peroneus longus tendon from the lateral margin of the cuboid bone, which is an avulsion. however, there are no fractures, and the bones are within normal range.
[patient] oh, what does that mean?
[doctor] it means that the tendon that attaches to your cuboid bone has a small tear. but it's not too severe, so that's good news.
[patient] okay, and what's the treatment?
[doctor] we'll start by reducing the swelling and managing the pain. you'll need to rest your foot and avoid putting any weight on it. we'll also have you use crutches for a while. in addition, we'll refer you to a physical therapist to help you regain strength and flexibility. surgery is rarely needed for this type of injury, but if your condition worsens, that may be an option.

MRI LEFT FOOT,CLINICAL:
A 49-year-old female with ankle pain times one month, without a specific injury. Patient complains of moderate to severe pain, worse with standing or walking on hard surfaces, with tenderness to palpation at the plantar aspect of the foot and midfoot region and tenderness over the course of the posterior tibialis tendon.
FINDINGS:
Received for second opinion interpretations is an MRI examination performed on 05/27/2005.
There is edema of the subcutis adipose space extending along the medial and lateral aspects of the ankle.
There is edema of the subcutis adipose space posterior to the Achilles tendon. Findings suggest altered biomechanics with crural fascial strains.
There is tendinosis of the posterior tibialis tendon as it rounds the tip of the medial malleolus with mild tendon thickening. There is possible partial surface tearing of the anterior aspect of the tendon immediately distal to the tip of the medial malleolus (axial inversion recovery image #16) which is a possible hypertrophic tear less than 50% in cross sectional diameter. The study has been performed with the foot in neutral position. Confirmation of this possible partial tendon tear would require additional imaging with the foot in a plantar flexed position with transaxial images of the posterior tibialis tendon as it rounds the tip of the medial malleolus oriented perpendicular to the course of the posterior tibialis tendon.
There is minimal synovitis of the flexor digitorum longus and flexor hallucis longus tendon sheaths consistent with flexor splinting but intrinsically normal tendons.
Normal peroneal tendons.
There is tendinosis of the tibialis anterior tendon with thickening but no demonstrated tendon tear. Normal extensor hallucis longus and extensor digitorum tendons.
Normal Achilles tendon. There is a low-lying soleus muscle that extends to within 2cm of the teno-osseous insertion of the Achilles tendon.
Normal distal tibiofibular syndesmotic ligamentous complex.
Normal lateral, subtalar and deltoid ligamentous complexes.
There are no erosions of the inferior neck of the talus and there are no secondary findings of a midfoot pronating force.
Normal plantar fascia. There is no plantar calcaneal spur.
There is venous engorgement of the plantar veins of the foot extending along the medial and lateral plantar cutaneous nerves which may be acting as intermittent entrapping lesions upon the medial and lateral plantar cutaneous nerves.
Normal tibiotalar, subtalar, talonavicular and calcaneocuboid articulations.
The metatarsophalangeal joint of the hallux was partially excluded from the field-of-view of this examination.
IMPRESSION:
Tendinosis of the posterior tibialis tendon with tendon thickening and possible surface fraying / tearing of the tendon immediately distal to the tip of the medial malleolus, however, confirmation of this finding would require additional imaging.
Minimal synovitis of the flexor digitorum longus and flexor hallucis longus tendon sheaths, consistent with flexor splinting.
Edema of the subcutis adipose space along the medial and lateral aspects of the ankle suggesting altered biomechanics and crural fascial strain.
Mild tendinosis of the tibialis anterior tendon with mild tendon thickening.
Normal plantar fascia and no plantar fasciitis.
Venous engorgement of the plantar veins of the foot which may be acting as entrapping lesions upon the medial and lateral plantar cutaneous nerves.","[doctor] hi there, i understand you've been experiencing ankle pain for the past month. can you tell me a bit more about it?
[patient] yes, the pain is moderate to severe and tends to worsen when i stand or walk on hard surfaces. i also feel tenderness when i touch the plantar aspect of my foot and midfoot region, as well as over the course of the posterior tibialis tendon.
[doctor] okay, we received the results of your mri and it looks like there is tendinosis of the posterior tibialis tendon with tendon thickening, and a possible partial surface tear of the anterior aspect of the tendon immediately distal to the tip of the medial malleolus. the good news is that there are no other significant abnormalities found in the mri. we will need additional imaging for confirmation of this finding, though.
[patient] that's good to know. is there anything else that could be causing my ankle pain?
[doctor] it seems that there is minimal synovitis of the flexor digitorum longus and flexor hallucis longus tendon sheaths, consistent with flexor splinting. there is also edema of the subcutis adipose space along the medial and lateral aspects of the ankle, suggesting altered biomechanics and crural fascial strain. additionally, there is mild tendinosis of the tibialis anterior tendon with mild tendon thickening. however, there is no plantar fasciitis found in the mri.
[patient] okay, so what are my treatment options?
[doctor] we can start with conservative treatments such as physical therapy, rest, and ice to manage the pain and inflammation. we can also prescribe you with orthotics to help with your altered biomechanics. if the symptoms persist despite these treatments, we can consider surgery as an option. in the meantime, i would advise you to avoid activities that aggravate the pain and to wear comfortable shoes with good arch support.

MRI LEFT KNEE WITHOUT CONTRAST,CLINICAL:
This is a 53-year-old female with left knee pain being evaluated for ACL tear.
FINDINGS:
This examination was performed on 10-14-05.
Normal medial meniscus without intrasubstance degeneration, surface fraying or discrete meniscal tear.
There is a discoid lateral meniscus and although there may be minimal superficial fraying along the inner edge of the body, there is no discrete tear (series #6 images #7-12).
There is a near-complete or complete tear of the femoral attachment of the anterior cruciate ligament. The ligament has a balled-up appearance consistent with at least partial retraction of most of the fibers of the ligament. There may be a few fibers still intact (series #4 images #12-14; series #5 images #12-14). The tibial fibers are normal.
Normal posterior cruciate ligament.
There is a sprain of the medial collateral ligament, with mild separation of the deep and superficial fibers at the femoral attachment (series #7 images #6-12). There is no complete tear or discontinuity and there is no meniscocapsular separation.
There is a sprain of the lateral ligament complex without focal tear or discontinuity of any of the intraarticular components.
Normal iliotibial band.
Normal quadriceps and patellar tendons.
There is contusion within the posterolateral corner of the tibia. There is also contusion within the patella at the midline patellar ridge where there is an area of focal chondral flattening (series #8 images #10-13). The medial and lateral patellar facets are otherwise normal as is the femoral trochlea in the there is no patellar subluxation.
There is a mild strain of the vastus medialis oblique muscle extending into the medial patellofemoral ligament and medial patellar retinaculum but there is no complete tear or discontinuity.
Normal lateral patellar retinaculum. There is a joint effusion and plica.
IMPRESSION:
Discoid lateral meniscus without a tear although there may be minimal superficial fraying along the inner edge of the body.  Near-complete if not complete tear of the femoral attachment of the anterior cruciate ligament.  Medial capsule sprain with associated strain of the vastus medialis oblique muscle.  There is focal contusion within the patella at the midline patella ridge. Joint effusion and plica.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm feeling quite worried. i have been experiencing left knee pain and i think it's something serious.
[doctor] don't worry, let's take a look. based on the mri results, you have a partial or complete tear of your anterior cruciate ligament. this is the main stabilizing ligament in your knee, so it's important to address this. you also have a sprain of your medial collateral ligament, and a strain of the vastus medialis oblique muscle.
[patient] what does that mean for my knee?
[doctor] we will have to treat these injuries to minimize further damage and relieve your pain. we need to address the partial or complete tear of your anterior cruciate ligament. we will discuss treatment options with you, which may include surgery or physical therapy, depending on the extent of the tear. the sprain of your medial collateral ligament and strain of the vastus medialis oblique muscle will likely heal with rest, ice, compression, and elevation. we will also address the contusion within your patella and the presence of a joint effusion and plica.

"EXAM:
MRI head without contrast.
REASON FOR EXAM:
Severe headaches.
INTERPRETATION:
Imaging was performed in the axial and sagittal planes using numerous pulse sequences at 1 tesla.  Correlation is made with the head CT of 4/18/05.
On the diffusion sequence, there is no significant bright signal to indicate acute infarction.  There is a large degree of increased signal involving the periventricular white matter extending around to the subcortical regions in symmetrical fashion consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic disease.  There is mild chronic ischemic change involving the pons bilaterally, slightly greater on the right, and when correlating with the recent scan, there is an old tiny lacunar infarct of the right brachium pontis measuring roughly 4 mm in size.  There are prominent perivascular spaces of the lenticulostriate distribution compatible with the overall degree of moderate to moderately advanced atrophy.  There is an old moderate-sized infarct of the mid and lateral aspects of the right cerebellar hemisphere as seen on the recent CT scan.  This involves mostly the superior portion of the hemisphere in the superior cerebellar artery distribution.  No abnormal mass effect is identified.  There are no findings to suggest active hydrocephalus.  No abnormal extra-axial collection is identified.  There is normal flow void demonstrated in the major vascular systems.
The sagittal sequence demonstrates no Chiari malformation.  The region of the pituitary/optic chiasm grossly appears normal.  The mastoids and paranasal sinuses are clear.
IMPRESSION:
1.  No definite acute findings identified involving the brain.
2.  There is prominent chronic cerebral ischemic change as described with mild chronic pontine ischemic changes.  There is an old moderate-sized infarct of the superior portion of the right cerebellar hemisphere.
3.  Moderate to moderately advanced atrophy.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?

[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that. i see here that you had an mri done on your head. i just reviewed the results and it looks like the mri showed some significant changes in your brain.
[patient] what does that mean?
[doctor] well, the mri found no definite acute findings, which is good. however, it did show that you have prominent chronic cerebral ischemic changes, which means that there is a lot of damage to the blood vessels in your brain. this is consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic disease. the mri also found an old moderate-sized infarct of the superior portion of the right cerebellar hemisphere, which means that you had a stroke in that area at some point in the past.
[patient] oh no, what does that mean for me?
[doctor] it means that you are at risk for having more strokes in the future. we will need to keep a close eye on your symptoms and make sure that you are taking steps to reduce your risk of having another stroke. we will also need to do some more tests to see if there are any underlying conditions that may be contributing to your risk of having a stroke.

[doctor] it's possible that you had an episode of multiple sclerosis, but it's difficult to say for sure. your symptoms seem to have resolved, but i would recommend that you come back for a follow-up mri of your c-spine, just to make sure everything is okay.
[patient] okay, i'll do that.
[doctor] thank you. if you experience any further symptoms, don't hesitate to come back and see me.","[doctor] hi there! how are you feeling today?
[patient] hey! um, i'm not feeling too good actually. i woke up with numbness on the left side of my body.
[doctor] oh no! when did this happen?
[patient] um, it started on july 29th, 1993.
[doctor] okay, thanks for letting me know. and have you experienced any weakness, tingling, or visual changes?
[patient] no, i haven't. but a few days ago, i noticed my right hand was stiff and clumsy, and i've been listing to the right when i walk.
[doctor] i see. have you had any recent illnesses or a history of multiple sclerosis?
[patient] no, i haven't. oh, and i don't experience lhermitte's or uhthoff's phenomena, mm-hmm.
[doctor] okay, got it. do you have any past medical history or family history that might be relevant?
[patient] um, i've had bronchitis twice in the past year, but that's about it. my father had hypertension and experienced two strokes at ages 45 and 80, but he's currently 82 years old. my mother has diabetes and is 80 years old.
[doctor] thanks for sharing that with me. let's move on to the physical examination. your blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate are all within normal range. your motor function is strong, but there's some slowing of the fine motor movements in your right hand. your sensory function is decreased below t2 level on the left side and there are some dysesthesias below l1 on the left. there is mild increase in muscle tone in the right upper and lower extremities. coordination is positive for rebound in the right upper extremity.
[patient] sounds good.
[doctor] i'm going to order some tests for you. we'll do an mri of your c-spine to check for any spinal cord abnormalities, and also a lumbar puncture to analyze your cerebrospinal fluid. let's also run some blood tests to check for any abnormalities in your blood.
[patient] alright, sounds good to me.

"EXAM:
MRI CERVICAL SPINE,CLINICAL:
A57-year-old male. Received for outside consultation is an MRI examination performed on 11/28/2005.
FINDINGS:
Normal brainstem-cervical cord junction. Normal cisterna magna with no tonsillar ectopia. Normal clivus with a normal craniovertebral junction. Normal anterior atlantoaxial articulation.
C2-3: Normal intervertebral disc with no spondylosis or uncovertebral joint arthrosis. Normal central canal and intervertebral neural foramina with no cord or radicular impingement.
C3-4: There is disc desiccation with minimal annular bulging. The residual AP diameter of the central canal measures approximately 10mm. CSF remains present surrounding the cord.
C4-5: There is disc desiccation with endplate spondylosis and mild uncovertebral joint arthrosis. The residual AP diameter of the central canal measures approximately 8mm with effacement of the circumferential CSF cleft producing a borderline central canal stenosis but no cord distortion or cord edema. There is minimal uncovertebral joint arthrosis.
C5-6: There is disc desiccation with minimal posterior annular bulging and a right posterolateral preforaminal disc protrusion measuring approximately 2 x 8mm (AP x transverse). The disc protrusion produces minimal rightward ventral thecal sac flattening but no cord impingement.
C6-7: There is disc desiccation with mild loss of disc space height and posterior endplate spondylosis and annular bulging producing central canal stenosis. The residual AP diameter of the central canal measures 8 mm with effacement of the circumferential CSF cleft. There is a left posterolateral disc-osteophyte complex encroaching upon the left intervertebral neural foramen with probable radicular impingement upon the exiting left C7 nerve root.
C7-T1, T1-2: Minimal disc desiccation with no disc displacement or endplate spondylosis.
IMPRESSION:
Multilevel degenerative disc disease as described above.
C4-5 borderline central canal stenosis with mild bilateral foraminal compromise.
C5-6 disc desiccation with a borderline central canal stenosis and a right posterolateral preforaminal disc protrusion producing thecal sac distortion.
C6-7 degenerative disc disease and endplate spondylosis with a left posterolateral disc-osteophyte complex producing probable neural impingement upon the exiting left C7 nerve root with a borderline central canal stenosis.
Normal cervical cord.","[doctor] hi, how are you today?
[patient] i'm alright, just a little worried about the results of my mri.
[doctor] yes, i understand. we received the results of your mri, and it shows that you have some degenerative disc disease in your cervical spine.
[patient] oh no, is it serious?
[doctor] well, it's not uncommon as we age. the report shows that you have disc desiccation, which is just a fancy way of saying that the discs in your spine are drying out.
[patient] okay, and what does that mean for me?
[doctor] it means that you may experience some discomfort or pain in your neck and shoulders. the report also mentions some central canal stenosis, which is a narrowing of the canal that the spinal cord runs through. this can cause some pressure on the cord or the nerves that exit the spine.
[patient] is there anything that can be done to help with the pain?
[doctor] yes, there are some treatments that can help. we can start with some physical therapy or chiropractic treatment to help with alignment and strengthening of the neck muscles. if that doesn't help, we can consider some medications for pain management or even injections to help reduce inflammation.
[patient] okay, that sounds good. is surgery an option?
[doctor] it's not usually the first option we consider, but in some cases where the stenosis is severe or there is significant nerve impingement, surgery may be necessary.
[patient] i see. is there anything i can do on my own to help with the pain?
[doctor] yes, there are some things you can do at home to help. regular exercise and stretching can help keep the muscles and joints in your neck flexible and reduce pain. you can also use heat or ice therapy to help reduce inflammation and pain.
[patient] alright, i'll try that. thank you doctor.
[doctor] you're welcome. we'll work together to come up with a treatment plan that works best for you.","[doctor] hey, how's it going today?

The patients signs and symptoms worsening during and after standing to check orthostatic blood pressures. She was immediately placed in a reverse Trendelenburg position and given IV fluids. Repeat neurologic exam at 5PM on the day of presentation revealed a return to the initial presentation of signs and symptoms. PT/PTT/GS/CBC/ABG were unremarkable. EKG revealed sinus tachycardia with rate dependent junctional changes. CXR unremarkable. MRI Brain was obtained and showed an evolving right thalamic/lentiform nucleus infarction best illustrated by increased signal on the Proton density weighted images. Over the ensuing days of admission she had significant fluctuations of her BP (200mmHG to 140mmHG systolic). Her symptoms worsened with falls in BP. Her BP was initially controlled with esmolol or labetalol. Renal Ultrasound, abdominal/pelvic CT, renal function scan, serum and urine osmolality, urine catecholamines/metanephrine studies were unremarkable. Carotid doppler study revealed 0-15%BICA stenosis and antegrade vertebral artery flow, bilaterally. Transthoracic echocardiogram was unremarkable. Cerebral angiogram was performed to r/o vasculitis.

MRI SPINAL CORD CERVICAL WITHOUT CONTRAST,CLINICAL:
Right arm pain, numbness and tingling.
FINDINGS:
Vertebral alignment and bone marrow signal characteristics are unremarkable. The C2-3 and C3-4 disk levels appear unremarkable.
At C4-5, broad based disk/osteophyte contacts the ventral surface of the spinal cord and may mildly indent the cord contour. A discrete cord signal abnormality is not identified. There may also be some narrowing of the neuroforamina at this level.
At C5-6, central disk-osteophyte contacts and mildly impresses on the ventral cord contour. Distinct neuroforaminal narrowing is not evident.
At C6-7, mild diffuse disk-osteophyte impresses on the ventral thecal sac and contacts the ventral cord surface. Distinct cord compression is not evident. There may be mild narrowing of the neuroforamina at his level.
A specific abnormality is not identified at the C7-T1 level.

"CC:
Weakness.
HX:
This 30 y/o RHM was in good health until 7/93, when he began experiencing RUE weakness and neck pain. He was initially treated by a chiropractor and, after an unspecified length of time, developed atrophy and contractures of his right hand. He then went to a local neurosurgeon and a cervical spine CT scan, 9/25/92, revealed an intramedullary lesion at C2-3 and an extramedullary lesion at C6-7. He underwent a C6-T1 laminectomy with exploration and decompression of the spinal cord. His clinical condition improved over a 3 month post-operative period, and then progressively worsened. He developed left sided paresthesia and upper extremity weakness (right worse than left). He then developed ataxia, nausea, vomiting, and hyperreflexia. On 8/31/93, MRI C-spine showed diffuse enlargement of the cervical and thoracic spine and multiple enhancing nodules in the posterior fossa. On 9/1/93, he underwent suboccipital craniotomy with tumor excision, decompression, and biopsy which was consistent with hemangioblastoma. His symptoms stabilized and he underwent 5040 cGy in 28 fractions to his brain and 3600 cGy in 20 fractions to his cervical and thoracic spinal cord from 9/93 through 1/19/94.
He was evaluated in the NeuroOncology clinic on 10/26/95 for consideration of chemotherapy. He complained of progressive proximal weakness of all four extremities and dysphagia. He had difficulty putting on his shirt and raising his arms, and he had been having increasing difficulty with manual dexterity (e.g. unable to feed himself with utensils). He had difficulty going down stairs, but could climb stairs. He had no bowel or bladder incontinence or retention.

CN: unremarkable exept for 4+/4+ strength of the trapezeii. No retinal hemangioblastoma were seen.
MOTOR: 4-/4- strength in proximal and distal upper extremities. There is diffuse atrophy and claw-hands, bilaterally. He is unable to manipulate hads to any great extent. 4+/4+ strength throughout BLE. There is also diffuse atrophy throughout the lower extremities though not as pronounced as in the upper extremities.
SENSORY: There was a right T3 and left T8 cord levels to PP on the posterior thorax. Decreased LT in throughout the 4 extremities.
COORD: difficult to assess due to weakness.
Station: BUE pronator drift.
Gait: stands without assistance, but can only manage to walk a few steps. Spastic gait.
Reflexes: Hyperreflexic on left (3+) and Hyporeflexic on right (1). Babinski signs were present bilaterally.
Gen exam: unremarkable.
COURSE:
9/8/95, GS normal. By 11/14/95, he required NGT feeding due to dysphagia and aspiration risk confirmed on cookie swallow studies.MRI Brain, 2/19/96, revealed several lesions (hemangioblastoma) in the cerebellum and brain stem. There were postoperative changes and a cyst in the medulla.
On 10/25/96, he presented with a 1.5 week h/o numbness in BLE from the mid- thighs to his toes, and worsening BLE weakness. He developed decubitus ulcers on his buttocks. He also had had intermittent urinary retention for month, chronic SOB and dysphagia. He had been sitting all day long as he could not move well and had no daytime assistance. His exam findings were consistent with his complaints. He had had no episodes of diaphoresis, headache, or elevated blood pressures. An MRI of the C-T spine, 10/26/96, revealed a prominent cervicothoracic syrinx extending down to T10. There was evidence of prior cervical laminectomy of C6-T1 with expansion of the cord in the thecalsac at that region. Multiple intradural extra spinal nodular lesions (hyperintense on T2, isointense on T1, enhanced gadolinium) were seen in the cervical spine and cisterna magna. The largest of which measures 1.1 x 1.0 x 2.0cm. There are also several large ring enhancing lesions in cerebellum. The lesions were felt to be consistent with hemangioblastoma. No surgical or medical intervention was initiated. Visiting nursing was provided. He has since been followed by his local physician","[doctor] hi there, it's nice to meet you. can you tell me what brings you in today?

Gen Exam: Inremarkable. HEENT: unremarkable.
COURSE:
The patient continued Sinemet CR 25/100 1tab TID and was told to monitor orthostatic BP at home. The evaluating Neurologist became concerned that she may have Parkinsonism plus dysautonomia.
She was seen again on 5/28/96 and reported no improvement in her condition. In addition she complained of worsening lightheadedness upon standing and had an episode, 1 week prior to 5/28/96, in which she was at her kitchen table and became unable to move. There were no involuntary movements or alteration in sensorium/mental status. During the episode she recalled wanting to turn, but could not. Two weeks prior to 5/28/96 she had an episode of orthostatic syncope in which she struck her head during a fall. She discontinued Sinemet 5 days prior to 5/28/96 and felt better. She felt she was moving slower and that her micrographia had worsened. She had had recent difficulty rolling over in bed and has occasional falls when turning. She denied hypophonia, dysphagia or diplopia.
On EXAM: BP (supine)153/110 with HR 88. BP (standing)110/80 with HR 96. (+) Myerson's sign and mild hypomimia, but no hypophonia. There was normal blinking and EOM. Motor strength was full throughout. No resting tremor, but mild postural tremor present. No rigidity noted. Mild decrement on finger tapping noted. Reflexes were symmetric. No Babinski signs and no clonus. Gait was short stepped with mild anteroflexed posture. She was unable to turn on point. 3-4 step Retropulsion noted. The Parkinsonism had been unresponsive to Sinemet and she had autonomic dysfunction suggestive of Shy-Drager syndrome. It was recommended that she liberalize dietary salt use and lie with head of the bed elevate at 20-30 degrees at night. Indomethacin was suggested to improve BP in future.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm not doing well, doctor. i keep falling and i'm experiencing lightheadedness.
[doctor] i see. can you tell me more about your symptoms?
[patient] well, i was diagnosed with parkinson's disease a few years ago. i've been experiencing staggering gait, falls, and episodes of lightheadedness. i also noticed that i was slowly losing my voice and my handwriting was becoming smaller. i've been taking sinemet but it hasn't been helping.
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that. have you noticed any improvement in your condition since you started taking sinemet?
[patient] no, not really. if anything, my condition has worsened. i've been feeling weak in the morning and worse as the day progresses.
[doctor] i understand. can you tell me more about the falls you've been experiencing?
[patient] i fell in my kitchen last week and couldn't move. i also had an episode of orthostatic syncope and fell two weeks ago. i discontinued my sinemet five days ago and i've been feeling a bit better.
[doctor] i see. during the episodes, did you experience any involuntary movements or alteration in your mental status?
[patient] no, i didn't. i just couldn't move.
[doctor] okay. can you please let me check your blood pressure and heart rate?
[patient] sure.
[doctor] your blood pressure and heart rate are a bit high. i'm going to recommend that you monitor your orthostatic blood pressure at home. i'm also concerned that you may have parkinsonism plus dysautonomia. i suggest we continue with your sinemet and monitor your symptoms closely. additionally, i recommend that you increase your dietary salt intake and elevate the head of your bed at night. we can also consider using indomethacin to improve your blood pressure in the future.
[patient] okay, thank you for the recommendations.
[doctor] no problem. let's continue to monitor your condition and see how it progresses.","[doctor] hey there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] um, not good, doc. i keep falling and feeling lightheaded.
[doctor] got it. can you tell me more about those symptoms? 
[patient] yeah, so i've had parkinson's for a few years now and i've been experiencing a lot of staggering, falling, and lightheadedness. i'm also losing my voice and my handwriting is getting smaller. i've been taking sinemet but it's not really helping. 
[doctor] i see. has the sinemet helped at all?
[patient] mm-hmm, not really. if anything, i think it's making things worse. i feel weaker in the morning and it gets worse as the day goes on.
[doctor] got it. tell me more about the falls you've been having. 
[patient] well, i fell in my kitchen last week and couldn't move. i also had an episode of orthostatic syncope and fell two weeks ago. i stopped taking sinemet five days ago and i'm feeling a little better.
[doctor] i see. did you have any involuntary movements or change in your mental state during those episodes? 
[patient] no, just couldn't move. 
[doctor] okay, let me check your blood pressure and heart rate real quick. 
[patient] sure thing. 
[doctor] your blood pressure and heart rate are a bit high. i recommend that you monitor your orthostatic blood pressure at home. i'm also worried that you may have parkinsonism plus dysautonomia. let's continue with your sinemet and monitor your symptoms closely. i also suggest increasing your salt intake and elevating the head of your bed at night. we can also consider using indomethacin to help with your blood pressure in the future. 
[patient] okay, thanks for the advice. 
[doctor] no worries. let's keep an eye on things and see how you progress.",2
"CC:
Difficulty with word finding.
HX:
This 27y/o RHF experienced sudden onset word finding difficulty and slurred speech on the evening of 2/19/96. She denied any associated dysphagia, diplopia, numbness or weakness of her extremities. She went to sleep with her symptoms on 2/19/96, and awoke with them on 2/20/96. She also awoke with a headache (HA) and mild neck stiffness. She took a shower and her HA and neck stiffness resolved. Throughout the day she continued to have difficulty with word finding and had worsening of her slurred speech. That evening, she began to experience numbness and weakness in the lower right face. She felt like there was a ""rubber-band"" wrapped around her tongue.
For 3 weeks prior to presentation, she experienced transient episodes of a ""boomerang"" shaped field cut in the left eye. The episodes were not associated with any other symptoms. One week prior to presentation, she went to a local ER for menorrhagia. She had just resumed taking oral birth control pills one week prior to the ER visit after having stopped their use for several months. Local evaluation included an unremarkable carotid duplex scan. However, a HCT with and without contrast reportedly revealed a left frontal gyriform enhancing lesion. An MRI brain scan on 2/20/96 revealed nonspecific white matter changes in the right periventricular region. EEG reportedly showed diffuse slowing. CRP was reportedly ""too high"" to calibrate.
MEDS:
Ortho-Novum 7-7-7 (started 2/3/96), and ASA (started 2/20/96).
PMH:
1)ventral hernia repair 10 years ago, 2)mild ""concussion"" suffered during a MVA; without loss of consciousness, 5/93, 3) Anxiety disorder, 4) One childbirth.
FHX:
She did not know her father and was not in contact with her mother.
SHX:
Lives with boyfriend. Smokes one pack of cigarettes every three days and has done so for 10 years. Consumes 6 bottles of beers, one day a week. Unemployed and formerly worked at an herbicide plant.
EXAM:
BP150/79, HR77, RR22, 37.4C.
MS: A&O to person, place and time. Speech was dysarthric with mild decreased fluency marked by occasional phonemic paraphasic errors. Comprehension, naming and reading were intact. She was able to repeat, though her repetition was occasionally marked by phonemic paraphasic errors. She had no difficulty with calculation.
CN: VFFTC, Pupils 5/5 decreasing to 3/3. EOM intact. No papilledema or hemorrhages seen on fundoscopy. No RAPD or INO. There was right lower facial weakness. Facial sensation was intact, bilaterally. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable.
MOTOR: 5/5 strength throughout with normal muscle bulk and tone.
Sensory: No deficits.
Coord/Station/Gait: unremarkable.
Reflexes 2/2 throughout. Plantar responses were flexor, bilaterally.
Gen Exam: unremarkable.
COURSE:
CRP 1.2 (elevated), ESR 10, RF 20, ANA 1:40, ANCA <1:40, TSH 2.0, FT4 1.73, Anticardiolipin antibody IgM 10.8GPL units (normal <10.9), Anticardiolipin antibody IgG 14.8GPL (normal<22.9), SSA and SSB were normal. Urine beta-hCG pregnancy and drug screen were negative. EKG, CXR and UA were negative.
MRI brain, 2/21/96 revealed increased signal on T2 imaging in the periventricular white matter region of the right hemisphere. In addition, there were subtle T2 signal changes in the right frontal, right parietal, and left parietal regions as seen previously on her local MRI can. In addition, special FLAIR imaging showed increased signal in the right frontal region consistent with ischemia.
She underwent Cerebral Angiography on 2/22/96. This revealed decreased flow and vessel narrowing the candelabra branches of the RMCA supplying the right frontal lobe. These changes corresponded to the areas of ischemic changes seen on MRI. There was also segmental narrowing of the caliber of the vessels in the circle of Willis. There was a small aneurysm at the origin of the LPCA. There was narrowing in the supraclinoid portion of the RICA and the proximal M1 and A1 segments. The study was highly suggestive of vasculitis.
2/23/96, Neuro-ophthalmology evaluation revealed no evidence of retinal vasculitic change. Neuropsychologic testing the same day revealed slight impairment of complex attention only. She was started on Prednisone 60mg qd and Tagamet 400mg qhs.
On 2/26/96, she underwent a right frontal brain biopsy. Pathologic evaluation revealed evidence of focal necrosis (stroke/infarct), but no evidence of vasculitis. Immediately following the brain biopsy, while still in the recovery room, she experienced sudden onset right hemiparesis and transcortical motor type aphasia. Initial HCT was unremarkable. An EEG was consistent with a focal lesion in the left hemisphere. However, a 2/28/96 MRI brain scan revealed new increased signal on T2 weighted images in a gyriform pattern from the left precentral gyrus to the superior frontal gyrus. This was felt consistent with vasculitis.
She began q2month cycles of Cytoxan (1,575mg IV on 2/29/96. She became pregnant after her 4th cycle of Cytoxan, despite warnings to the contrary. After extensive discussions with OB/GYN it was recommended she abort the pregnancy. She underwent neuropsychologic testing which revealed no significant cognitive deficits. She later agreed to the abortion. She has undergone 9 cycles of Cytoxan ( one cycle every 2 months) as of 4/97. She had complained of one episode of paresthesias of the LUE in 1/97. MRI then showed no new signs ischemia.","[doctor] hi there! can you tell me why you're here today?

CN: Visual acuity has declined from 20/40 to 20/400, OD; 20/30, OS. No RAPD. EOM was full and smooth and without nystagmus. Goldmann visual fields revealed a central scotoma and enlarged blind spot OD and OS (OD worse) with a normal periphery. Intraocular pressures were 15/14 (OD/OS). There was moderate pallor of the disc, OD. Facial sensation was decreased on the right side (V1 distribution).
Motor/Sensory/Coord/Station/Gait: were all unremarkable.
Reflexes: 2/2 and symmetric throughout. Plantars were flexor, bilaterally.
Gen Exam: unremarkable.
COURSE:
MRI Brain, 10/7/92, revealed: a large 6x5x6cm slightly heterogeneous, mostly isointense lesion on both T1 and T2 weighted images arising from the planum sphenoidale and olfactory groove. The mass extends approximately 3.6cm superior to the planum into both frontal regions with edema in both frontal lobes. The mass extends 2.5cm inferiorly involving the ethmoid sinuses with resultant obstruction of the sphenoid and frontal sinuses.
It also extends into the superomedial aspect of the right maxillary sinus. There is probable partial encasement of both internal carotid arteries just above the siphon. The optic nerves are difficult to visualize but there is also probable encasement of these structures as well. The mass enhances significantly with gadolinium contrast. These finds are consistent with Meningioma.
The patient underwent excision of this tumor by simultaneous bifrontal craniotomy and lateral rhinotomy following an intrasinus biopsy which confirmed the meningioma. Postoperatively, he lost visual acuity, OS, but this gradually returned to baseline. His 9/6/96 neuro-ophthalmology evaluation revealed visual acuity of 20/25-3 (OD) and 20/80-2 (OS). His visual fields continued to abnormal, but improved and stable when compared to 10/92. His anosmia never resolved.","[doctor]: hi, how are you feeling?

At peak hyperemic effect, 24.9 mCi of Myoview were injected for the stress imaging and earlier 8.2 mCi were injected for the resting and the usual SPECT and gated SPECT protocol was followed and the data was analyzed using Cedars-Sinai software.  The patient did not walk because of prior history of inability to exercise long enough on treadmill.
The resting heart rate was 57 with the resting blood pressure 143/94.  Maximum heart rate achieved was 90 with a maximum blood pressure unchanged.
EKG at rest showed sinus rhythm with no significant ST-T wave changes of reversible ischemia or injury.  Subtle nonspecific in III and aVF were seen.  Maximum stress test EKG showed inverted T wave from V4 to V6.  Normal response to Lexiscan.
CONCLUSION:
Maximal Lexiscan perfusion with subtle abnormalities non-conclusive.  Please refer to the Myoview interpretation.
MYOVIEW INTERPRETATION:
The left ventricle appeared to be normal in size on both stress and rest with no change between the stress and rest with left ventricular end-diastolic volume of 115 and end-systolic of 51.  EF estimated and calculated at 56%.
Cardiac perfusion reviewed, showed no reversible defect indicative of myocardium risk and no fixed defect indicative of myocardial scarring.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Normal stress/rest cardiac perfusion with no indication of ischemia.
2.  Normal LV function and low likelihood of significant epicardial coronary narrowing.
","[doctor] hi, it's good to see you today. i understand that you've been experiencing chest discomfort?
[patient] yes, that's correct.
[doctor] okay, well we did a lexiscan myoview stress study to see what might be causing that. during the test, you were given a total of 0.4mg of lexiscan iv injection and 24.9 mci of myoview were injected for stress imaging. we followed the usual protocol for spect and gated spect and the data was analyzed using cedars-sinai software. based on the results, we found that there is no indication of ischemia or any significant epicardial coronary narrowing. additionally, your left ventricle appeared normal in size and functioned well. so, overall, the test came back normal and there seems to be no serious issues.

2.  Lack of radiographic evidence of malignancy should not delay a biopsy if a clinically suspicious mass is present.
3.  These images were obtained with FDA-approved digital mammography equipment, and iCAD Second Look Software Version 7.2 was utilized.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm okay, thanks for asking.
[doctor] that's great to hear. i see here that you had a screening mammogram done. can you tell me a bit more about that?
[patient] yes, it was just a routine screening. i don't have any complaints right now.
[doctor] okay, and i also see that you had a breast cancer diagnosis in your right breast in 1984, is that correct?
[patient] yes, that's right.
[doctor] and you had radiation therapy afterwards, is that also correct?
[patient] yes, i did.
[doctor] okay. and is there any family history of breast cancer?
[patient] yes, my sister was diagnosed with breast cancer when she was 59.
[doctor] i see. well, i have the results of your mammogram here. there are no significant changes compared to your previous mammogram, and there is no evidence of malignancy.
[patient] that's a relief to hear.
[doctor] yes, it is. however, i do recommend that you come back for annual screening mammography or sooner if you have any clinical symptoms that concern you. do you have any questions about the results or anything else related to your health?
[patient] no, i think i understand everything. thank you for your help.
[doctor] you're welcome. and just to remind you, although mammography is a very effective screening tool, it does not detect all cases of breast cancer. if you notice any unusual changes in your breasts, such as a lump or skin changes, please let us know.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?

"CC:
Memory loss.
HX:
This 77 y/o RHF presented with a one year history of progressive memory loss. Two weeks prior to her evaluation at UIHC she agreed to have her sister pick her up for church at 8:15AM, Sunday morning. That Sunday she went to pick up her sister at her sister's home and when her sister was not there (because the sister had gone to pick up the patient) the patient left. She later called the sister and asked her if she (sister) had overslept. During her UIHC evaluation she denied she knew anything about the incident. No other complaints were brought forth by the patients family.

"REASON FOR EXAMINATION:
Cardiac arrhythmia.
INTERPRETATION:
No significant pericardial effusion was identified.
The aortic root dimensions are within normal limits.  The four cardiac chambers dimensions are within normal limits.  No discrete regional wall motion abnormalities are identified.  The left ventricular systolic function is preserved with an estimated ejection fraction of 60%.  The left ventricular wall thickness is within normal limits.
The aortic valve is trileaflet with adequate excursion of the leaflets.  The mitral valve and tricuspid valve motion is unremarkable.  The pulmonic valve is not well visualized.
Color flow and conventional Doppler interrogation of cardiac valvular structures revealed mild mitral regurgitation and mild tricuspid regurgitation with an RV systolic pressure calculated to be 28 mmHg.  Doppler interrogation of the mitral in-flow pattern is within normal limits for age.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Preserved left ventricular systolic function.
2.  Mild mitral regurgitation.
3.  Mild tricuspid regurgitation.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm feeling good, thank you.
[doctor] that's great to hear. so, i reviewed your test results and i see that you have a preserved left ventricular systolic function. this means that your heart's ability to pump blood is normal.
[patient] that's good news.
[doctor] yes, it is. however, we did find mild mitral regurgitation and mild tricuspid regurgitation. this means that there is backward blood flow through the mitral and tricuspid valves.
[patient] is this something to be concerned about?
[doctor] at this time, it's not a major concern. we will continue to monitor it over time to make sure it doesn't worsen. we will also calculate the rv systolic pressure which is currently at 28 mmhg. we will keep an eye on it to make sure it does not increase. in the meantime, it is important to maintain a healthy lifestyle, eat a balanced diet and exercise regularly.
[patient] okay, i understand. is there anything else i need to do?
[doctor] no, just continue to take your medications as prescribed and come back to see me in a few months for a follow-up.","[doctor] hi there! how are you feeling today?

29 y/o male with cerebral palsy, non-shunted hydrocephalus, spastic quadriplegia, mental retardation, bilateral sensory neural hearing loss, severe neurogenic scoliosis and multiple contractures of the 4 extremities, neurogenic bowel and bladder incontinence, and a history of seizures.
He was seen for evaluation of seizures which first began at age 27 years, two years before presentation. His typical episodes consist of facial twitching (side not specified), unresponsive pupils, and moaning. The episodes last approximately 1-2 minutes in duration and are followed by post-ictal fatigue. He was placed on DPH, but there was no record of an EEG prior to presentation. He had had no seizure events in over 1 year prior to presentation while on DPH 100mg--O--200mg. He also complained of headaches for the past 10 years.
BIRTH HX:
Spontaneous Vaginal delivery at 36weeks gestation to a G2P1 mother. Birth weight 7#10oz. No instrumentation required. Labor = 11hours. ""Light gas anesthesia"" given. Apgars unknown. Mother reportedly had the ""flu"" in the 7th or 8th month of gestation.
Patient discharged 5 days post-partum.
Development: spoke first words between 1 and 2 years of age. Rolled side to side at age 2, but did not walk. Fed self with hands at age 2 years. Never toilet trained.
PMH:
1)Hydrocephalus manifested by macrocephaly by age 2-3 months. Head circumference 50.5cm at 4 months of age (wide sutures and bulging fontanels). Underwent ventriculogram, age 4 months, which illustrated massive enlargement of the lateral ventricles and normal sized aqueduct and 4th ventricle. The cortex of the cerebral hemisphere was less than 1cm. in thickness; especially in the occipital regions where only a thin rim of tissue was left. Neurosurgical intervention was not attempted and the patient deemed inoperable at the time. By 31 months of age the patients head circumference was 68cm, at which point the head size arrested. Other problems mentioned above.
SHX:
institutionalized at age 18 years.
FHX:
unremarkable.
EXAM:
Vitals unknown.
MS: awake with occasional use of intelligible but inappropriately used words.

Dysphagia with possible aspiration.
FINDINGS:
A cookie deglutition study was performed.  The patient was examined in the direct lateral position.

Persistently demonstrable is the presence of penetration with thin liquids.  This is not evident with thick liquids, semisolids or solids.
There is weakness in the oral phase of deglutition.  Subglottic region appears normal.  There is no evidence of aspiration demonstrated.

[doctor] i see. well, we did do a cookie deglutition study on you which showed that you have penetration with thin liquids. do you know what that means?
[patient] no, i don't.
[doctor] so, during the study, we saw that when you swallowed thin liquids, they went down your throat and entered your airway a little bit, but not enough to cause aspiration. we didn't see this happen with thick liquids or solids.
[patient] i see.
[doctor] we also found weakness in the oral phase of deglutition, which means that the muscles in your mouth that help you swallow may not be as strong as they should be.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] the good news is that we didn't see any evidence of aspiration, which means that the thin liquids didn't go all the way down into your lungs. however, we still need to address the penetration and the weakness in your swallowing muscles. we'll need to work together to come up with a plan to help you with your dysphagia.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling?

[patient] my name is [patient name] and the month is [current month].
[doctor] good. can you spell ""world"" backwards for me?
[patient] d-l-o-w.
[doctor] okay. your motor skills seem to be intact. however, there is some neglect in your left visual field. i am going to order some tests to see if there is any underlying condition causing your confusion.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] your lab results show that your mean corpuscular volume is high and you have 20+wbc in your urinalysis. you have a uti and i am going to treat it with antibiotics.
[patient] alright.
[doctor] your vitamin b12 level is also reduced, and i am going to give you vitamin b12 shots for 7 days followed by monthly doses. you also have elevated esr and crp levels, so i am putting you on thiamine, folate, and asa as well.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] your eeg showed some slowing and focal slowing in the right temporal area, and hct revealed a new infarct in the left parietal lobe and an old infarct in the right parietal lobe. the confusion is likely due to the uti in the face of old and new strokes and vitamin b12 deficiency.
[patient] i see.
[doctor] you were referred to vascular surgery for a carotid endarterectomy, but you were lost to follow-up. i strongly recommend that you follow up with your appointments and take your medications as prescribed.
[patient] okay, thank you.
[doctor] you're welcome. let's schedule a follow-up appointment to monitor your progress.","[doctor] hey there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] um, not great. i'm pretty confused.
[doctor] aw, sorry to hear that. can you tell me more about what's going on?
[patient] yeah, i feel kinda disoriented and i can't remember where i am or what day it is.
[doctor] mm-hmm, i hear you. have you had any trouble speaking or moving around?
[patient] yeah, i had some left-side weakness and trouble talking but it went away after a few hours.
[doctor] okay, got it. have you had any medical issues in the past that might be related to your confusion?
[patient] yeah, i've had a couple of strokes before. one in '90 and one in '91, and i had a right parietal stroke in '87 that left me with some weakness on my left side.
[doctor] ah, i see. are you taking any medications right now?
[patient] nope, i'm not on anything.
[doctor] alright, do you have a family history of stroke or alzheimer's disease?
[patient] yeah, actually my dad's side of the family has a history of both.
[doctor] okay, thanks for letting me know. have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
[patient] i've been kinda picky about what i eat, but my weight hasn't really changed.
[doctor] got it. now i'm going to do a physical exam. can you please tell me your name and what month it is?
[patient] sure, i'm [patient name] and it's [current month].
[doctor] great, can you spell ""world"" backwards for me?
[patient] w-o-r-l-d.
[doctor] okay, your motor skills seem to be fine. but i did notice some neglect in your left visual field. i'm going to order some tests to see if we can figure out what's causing your confusion.
[patient] alright, sounds good.
[doctor] your lab results show that you have a urinary tract infection (uti), which is probably contributing to your symptoms. i'm going to give you some antibiotics to treat it.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] your vitamin b12 levels are also low, so i'm going to start you on some b12 shots for a week followed by monthly doses. you also have some elevated markers of inflammation, so i'm going to put you on thiamine, folate, and aspirin as well.
[patient] got it.
[doctor] your eeg showed some slowing and focal slowing in the right temporal area, and the ct scan showed a new infarct in the left parietal lobe and an old infarct in the right parietal lobe. it's likely that your confusion is due to the uti along with the strokes and b12 deficiency.
[patient] okay, i understand.
[doctor] you were supposed to see a vascular surgeon for a carotid endarterectomy, but you didn't show up for the appointment. i really think it's important that you keep up with your appointments and take your meds as directed.
[patient] alright, thank you.
[doctor] no problem. let's schedule a follow-up appointment to see how you're doing.",2
"EXAM:
CT stone protocol.
REASON FOR EXAM:
History of stones, rule out stones.
TECHNIQUE:
Noncontrast CT abdomen and pelvis per renal stone protocol.
FINDINGS:
Correlation is made with a prior examination dated 01/20/09.
Again identified are small intrarenal stones bilaterally.  These are unchanged.  There is no hydronephrosis or significant ureteral dilatation.  There is no stone along the expected course of the ureters or within the bladder.  There is a calcification in the low left pelvis not in line with ureter, this finding is stable and is compatible with a phlebolith.  There is no asymmetric renal enlargement or perinephric stranding.
The appendix is normal.  There is no evidence of a pericolonic inflammatory process or small bowel obstruction.
Scans through the pelvis disclose no free fluid or adenopathy.
Lung bases aside from very mild dependent atelectasis appear clear.
Given the lack of contrast, liver, spleen, adrenal glands, and the pancreas are grossly unremarkable.  The gallbladder is present.  There is no abdominal free fluid or pathologic adenopathy.
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral intrarenal stones, no obstruction.
2. Normal appendix.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i am doing fine, thank you.
[doctor] alright. so, we received the results of your ct scan. it looks like the small intrarenal stones in both kidneys from your previous exam are still present, but they haven't caused any obstruction.

[doctor] great, but you may still feel sore due to the accident. so just take it easy for a few days and take any pain meds you were prescribed. if anything feels off, let us know.",2
"EXAM:
CT head without contrast, CT facial bones without contrast, and CT cervical spine without contrast.
REASON FOR EXAM:
A 68-year-old status post fall with multifocal pain.
COMPARISONS:
None.
TECHNIQUE:
Sequential axial CT images were obtained from the vertex to the thoracic inlet without contrast.  Additional high-resolution sagittal and/or coronal reconstructed images were obtained through the facial bones and cervical spine for better visualization of the osseous structures.
INTERPRETATIONS:
HEAD:
There is mild generalized atrophy.  Scattered patchy foci of decreased attenuation is seen in the subcortical and periventricular white matter consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic changes.  There are subtle areas of increased attenuation seen within the frontal lobes bilaterally.  Given the patient's clinical presentation, these likely represent small hemorrhagic contusions.  Other differential considerations include cortical calcifications, which are less likely.  The brain parenchyma is otherwise normal in attenuation without evidence of mass, midline shift, hydrocephalus, extra-axial fluid, or acute infarction.  The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.  The bony calvarium and skull base are unremarkable.
FACIAL BONES:
The osseous structures about the face are grossly intact without acute fracture or dislocation.  The orbits and extra-ocular muscles are within normal limits.  There is diffuse mucosal thickening in the ethmoid and right maxillary sinuses.  The remaining visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.  Diffuse soft tissue swelling is noted about the right orbit and right facial bones without underlying fracture.
CERVICAL SPINE:
There is mild generalized osteopenia.  There are diffuse multilevel degenerative changes identified extending from C4-C7 with disk space narrowing, sclerosis, and marginal osteophyte formation.  The remaining cervical vertebral body heights are maintained without acute fracture, dislocation, or spondylolisthesis.  The central canal is grossly patent.  The pedicles and posterior elements appear intact with multifocal facet degenerative changes.  There is no prevertebral or paravertebral soft tissue masses identified.  The atlanto-dens interval and dens are maintained.
IMPRESSION:
1.Subtle areas of increased attenuation identified within the frontal lobes bilaterally suggesting small hemorrhagic contusions.  There is no associated shift or mass effect at this time.  Less likely, this finding could be secondary to cortical calcifications.  The patient may benefit from a repeat CT scan of the head or MRI for additional evaluation if clinically indicated.
2.Atrophy and chronic small vessel ischemic changes in the brain.
3.Ethmoid and right maxillary sinus congestion and diffuse soft tissue swelling over the right side of the face without underlying fracture.
4.Osteopenia and multilevel degenerative changes in the cervical spine as described above.
5.Findings were discussed with Dr. X from the emergency department at the time of interpretation.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling?
[patient] i'm not feeling too great, doctor. i fell recently and i'm in a lot of pain.
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that. we ordered some ct scans to see what's going on inside your body. after reviewing the scans, i can see that there are some areas of increased attenuation within the frontal lobes bilaterally. it's likely that you have small hemorrhagic contusions, but it's also possible that you have cortical calcifications. we may need to do a repeat ct scan or an mri to get a better look. 
[patient] what does that mean for me?
[doctor] it means that we need to monitor you closely and make sure that these areas don't get worse. we also found that you have some atrophy and chronic small vessel ischemic changes in your brain. in addition, we noticed some congestion and swelling in your ethmoid and right maxillary sinuses as well as diffuse soft tissue swelling over the right side of your face. 
[patient] what about my spine? 
[doctor] we also noticed some degenerative changes in your cervical spine, but nothing too severe. we'll need to monitor that as well.

[patient] mm-hmm, what does that mean for me exactly?
[doctor] well, it means that we need to monitor you closely to make sure that these areas don't get worse. we also found some atrophy and chronic small vessel ischemic changes in your brain. additionally, we noticed some congestion and swelling in your ethmoid and right maxillary sinuses, as well as diffuse soft tissue swelling over the right side of your face.

"REASON FOR CT SCAN:
The patient is a 79-year-old man with adult hydrocephalus who was found to have large bilateral effusions on a CT scan performed on January 16, 2008.  I changed the shunt setting from 1.5 to 2.0 on February 12, 2008 and his family obtained this repeat CT scan to determine whether his subdural effusions were improving.
CT scan from 03/11/2008 demonstrates frontal horn span at the level of foramen of Munro of 2.6 cm.  The 3rd ventricular contour which is flat with a 3rd ventricular span of 10 mm.  There is a single shunt, which enters on the right occipital side and ends in the left lateral ventricle.  He has symmetric bilateral subdurals that are less than 1 cm in breadth each, which is a reduction from the report from January 16, 2008, which states that he had a subdural hygroma, maximum size 1.3 cm on the right and 1.1 cm on the left.
ASSESSMENT:
The patient's subdural effusions are still noticeable, but they are improving at the setting of 2.0.
PLAN:
I would like to see the patient with a new head CT in about three months, at which time we can decide whether 2.0 is the appropriate setting for him to remain at or whether we can consider changing the shunt setting.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i am doing okay, just a bit tired.
[doctor] i see. i wanted to talk to you about the results of your ct scan from 03/11/2008. the scan showed that your subdural effusions have improved since your previous scan on january 16, 2008.
[patient] oh, that's good news.
[doctor] yes, it is. however, the effusions are still noticeable, but they are getting better with the shunt setting of 2.0.
[patient] i see. what does this mean for my treatment?
[doctor] i would like to see you again in about three months for a new head ct scan. at that time, we can determine whether 2.0 is still the appropriate setting for your shunt, or whether we need to consider changing it.
[patient] all right. is there anything else i should be doing in the meantime?
[doctor] just continue with your current treatment plan and keep an eye out for any changes in your symptoms. if you experience any concerning symptoms, be sure to let us know right away.
[patient] okay, i will. thank you for explaining everything to me.
[doctor] you're welcome. we'll see you in three months for your next ct scan.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?

"REASON FOR EXAM:
Left arm and hand numbness.
TECHNIQUE:
Noncontrast axial CT images of the head were obtained with 5 mm slice thickness.
FINDINGS:
There is an approximately 5-mm shift of the midline towards the right side.  Significant low attenuation is seen throughout the white matter of the right frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes.  There is loss of the cortical sulci on the right side.  These findings are compatible with edema.  Within the right parietal lobe, a 1.8 cm, rounded, hyperintense mass is seen.
No hydrocephalus is evident.
The calvarium is intact.  The visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.
IMPRESSION:
A 5 mm midline shift to the left side secondary to severe edema of the white matter of the right frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes.  A 1.8 cm high attenuation mass in the right parietal lobe is concerning for hemorrhage given its high density.  A postcontrast MRI is required for further characterization of this mass.  Gradient echo imaging should be obtained.","[doctor] hi there, can you tell me what brought you in today?
[patient] hi, yes. i've been experiencing numbness in my left arm and hand.
[doctor] i see. have you experienced any other symptoms or changes in your body recently?
[patient] no, just the numbness.
[doctor] okay. i ordered a ct scan and the results show that there is some concerning findings. there is severe swelling in the white matter of the right frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, which has caused a shift of the midline towards the left. additionally, there is a mass in the right parietal lobe that is concerning for hemorrhage. we will need to conduct a post-contrast mri for further evaluation.
[patient] what does that mean? should i be worried?
[doctor] i want to be honest with you. the findings are concerning and we need to conduct further testing to determine the best course of action. we will need to schedule the mri as soon as possible to get a better understanding of what is happening. we will also need to consider a referral to a neurosurgeon for their expert opinion.
[patient] okay, thank you for being honest with me. what are the next steps we need to take?
[doctor] i will submit a referral for the mri and we will also schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and possible treatment options. in the meantime, please monitor any other symptoms you may be experiencing and take care of yourself.","[doctor] hey there, what brings you in today?

"EXAM:
CT KUB.
REASON FOR EXAM:
Flank pain.
TECHNIQUE:
Noncontrast CT abdomen and pelvis per renal stone protocol.
Correlation is made with the prior examination dated 01/16/09.
FINDINGS:
There is no intrarenal stone or obstruction bilaterally.  There is no hydronephrosis, ureteral dilatation.  There are calcifications about the pelvis including one in the left upper pelvis, but these are stable from the prior study and there is no upstream ureteral dilatation, the findings therefore are favored to represent phleboliths.  The bladder is nearly completely decompressed.  There is no asymmetric renal enlargement or perinephric stranding as secondary evidence of obstruction.
The appendix is normal.  There is no evidence for a pericolonic inflammatory process or small bowel obstruction.
Dedicated scan to the pelvis disclosed the aforementioned presumed phleboliths.  There is no pelvic free fluid or adenopathy.
Lung bases appear clear.  Given the lack of contrast, liver, spleen, adrenal glands, and the pancreas appear grossly unremarkable.  The gallbladder has been resected.  There is no abdominal free fluid or pathologic adenopathy.
IMPRESSION:
1. No renal stone or evidence of obstruction.  Stable appearing pelvic calcifications likely indicate phleboliths.
2. Normal appendix.","[doctor] hello, what brings you in today?

HX:
This 51y/o RHF fell four times on 1/3/93, because her ""legs suddenly gave out."" She subsequently noticed weakness involving the right leg, and often required the assistance of her arms to move it. During some of these episodes she appeared mildly pale and felt generally weak; her husband would give her 3 teaspoons of sugar and she would appear to improve, thought not completely. During one episode she held her RUE in an ""odd fisted posture."" She denied any other focal weakness, sensory change, dysarthria, diplopia, dysphagia or alteration of consciousness. She did not seek medical attention despite her weakness. Then, last night, 1/4/93, she fell again
and because her weakness did not subsequently improve she came to UIHC for evaluation on 1/5/93.

COURSE:
CBC, GS (including glucose), PT/PTT, EKG, CXR on admission, 1/5/93, were unremarkable. HCT, 1/5/93, revealed a hypodensity in the left caudate consistent with ischemic change. Carotid Duplex: 0-15%RICA, 16-49%LICA; antegrade vertebral artery flow, bilaterally. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed borderline LV hypertrophy and normal LV function. No valvular abnormalities or thrombus were seen.
The patient's history and exam findings of right facial and RLE weakness with sparing of the RUE would invoke a RACA territory stroke with recurrent artery of Heubner involvement causing the facial weakness.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm not feeling too good, doctor.
[doctor] can you tell me what happened?
[patient] i fell several times in the past few days because my legs suddenly gave out. after the first fall, i noticed weakness in my right leg and sometimes needed to use my arms to move it.
[doctor] did you experience any other symptoms during these episodes?
[patient] sometimes i felt weak and pale, and my husband would give me sugar which seemed to help a little. during one episode, i held my right arm in an odd fisted posture.
[doctor] did you notice any changes in your vision, speech, or difficulty swallowing?
[patient] no, i did not experience any of those symptoms.
[doctor] did you seek medical attention after the falls and weakness?
[patient] no, i did not until last night when i fell again, and the weakness did not improve afterward.
[doctor] i see. can you tell me about your medical history and medications?
[patient] i have type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and degenerative joint disease. i had a vitrectomy and retinal traction for retinal detachment, cholecystectomy, and a cataract implant. i take micronase and hctz but stopped taking aspirin six months ago.
[doctor] have you ever had any similar medical issues before, or any family medical history?
[patient] my mother died of a heart attack at age 63, and my grandaunt had a stroke. my father had cancer, and my sisters have hypertension. i do not have any other family history of diabetes.
[doctor] thank you for the information. i'm going to perform a physical exam on you now. can you follow my finger with your eyes? how about your arms and legs, can you move them for me?
[patient] yes, i can move them.
[doctor] during the exam, i noticed weakness in your right lower facial muscles and right leg, but the rest of your exam was normal. i want to order some tests to determine the cause of your weakness, including a ct scan and a carotid duplex. the ct scan showed some ischemic changes in your left caudate, which could be the cause of your symptoms. we also did an echocardiogram that showed borderline left ventricular hypertrophy but no abnormalities. based on your exam findings, it seems like you had a stroke in the right anterior cerebral artery territory, and we will need to monitor your recovery closely.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] um, not too good, doctor.
[doctor] oh no, what happened?
[patient] well, i fell a few times in the past few days because my legs suddenly gave out. after the first fall, i noticed weakness in my right leg and sometimes needed to use my arms to move it.
[doctor] uh-huh. did anything else happen during these episodes?
[patient] sometimes i felt weak and pale, and my husband would give me sugar which seemed to help a little. during one episode, i held my right arm in an odd fisted posture.
[doctor] i see. did you notice any changes in your vision or difficulty swallowing or speaking?
[patient] no, i didn't have any of those symptoms, thankfully.
[doctor] did you go to the hospital or see a doctor after the falls and weakness?
[patient] no, i didn't until last night when i fell again, and the weakness did not improve afterward.
[doctor] okay. can you tell me about your medical history and medications?
[patient] sure. i have type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and degenerative joint disease. i had a vitrectomy and retinal traction for retinal detachment, cholecystectomy, and a cataract implant. i take micronase and hctz but stopped taking aspirin six months ago.

"EXAM:
CT chest with contrast.
REASON FOR EXAM:
Pneumonia, chest pain, short of breath, and coughing up blood.
TECHNIQUE:
Postcontrast CT chest 100 mL of Isovue-300 contrast.
FINDINGS:
This study demonstrates a small region of coalescent infiltrates/consolidation in the anterior right upper lobe.  There are linear fibrotic or atelectatic changes associated with this.  Recommend followup to ensure resolution.  There is left apical scarring.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is lingular and right middle lobe mild atelectasis or fibrosis.
Examination of the mediastinal windows disclosed normal inferior thyroid.  Cardiac and aortic contours are unremarkable aside from mild atherosclerosis.  The heart is not enlarged.  There is no pathologic adenopathy identified in the chest including the bilateral axillary and hilar regions.
Very limited assessment of the upper abdomen demonstrates no definite abnormalities.
There are mild degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION:
1.Anterior small right upper lobe infiltrate/consolidation.  Recommend followup to ensure resolution given its consolidated appearance.
2.Bilateral atelectasis versus fibrosis.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, i'm not feeling well. i have chest pain, shortness of breath, and i'm coughing up blood.
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that. we ordered a ct scan of your chest to see what's going on. the scan showed that you have an area of infection in the front of your right upper lung. we also saw some scarring on the upper left part of your lung, and some mild atelectasis or fibrosis in the middle and lower parts of your right lung. there was no fluid around your lungs or any air leaks from your lungs. we need to follow up to make sure that the infection is resolving. 
[patient] do i need to be admitted to the hospital? 
[doctor] not at this time. we can treat the infection with antibiotics and see how you respond. i want you to come back in a week for a follow-up visit and we will do another scan to see if the infection is improving. 
[patient] okay, what about the scarring and atelectasis or fibrosis? is that something i need to be worried about? 
[doctor] the scarring is from a previous infection, and the atelectasis or fibrosis is likely from previous infections or inflammation. it's not something that we need to worry about right now, but we will continue to monitor it. 
[patient] okay, thank you for explaining that to me. 
[doctor] of course. we will start you on antibiotics for the infection and give you something for the pain. if you have any trouble breathing or your symptoms get worse, come back to the hospital right away.

Difficulty with speech.
HX:
This 84 y/o RHF presented with sudden onset word finding and word phonation difficulties. She had an episode of transient aphasia in 2/92 during which she had difficulty with writing, written and verbal comprehension, and exhibited numerous semantic and phonemic paraphasic errors of speech. These problems resolved within 24 hours of onset and she had no subsequent speech problems prior to this presentation. Workup at that time revealed a right to left shunt on trans-thoracic echocardiogram. Carotid doppler studies showed 0-15% BICA stenosis and a LICA aneurysm (mentioned above). Brain CT was unremarkable. She was placed on ASA after the 2/92 event.
In 5/92 she was involved in a motor vehicle accident and suffered a fractured left humerus and left occipital scalp laceration. HCT at that time showed a small area of slightly increased attenuation at the posterior right claustrum only. This was not felt to be a contusion; nevertheless, she was placed on Dilantin seizure prophylaxis. Her left arm was casted and she returned home.
5 hours prior to presentation today, the patient began having difficulty finding words and putting them into speech. She was able to comprehend speech. This continued for an hour; then partially resolved for one hour; then returned; then waxed and waned. There was no reported weakness, numbness, incontinence, seizure-like activity, incoordination, HA, nausea, vomiting, or lightheadedness,MEDS:

Gen Exam: 2/6 Systolic ejection murmur in aortic area.
COURSE:
No family history of Huntington's disease could be elicited from relatives. Brain CT, 1/18/93: bilateral calcification of the globus pallidi and a high attenuation focus in the right occipital lobe thought to represent artifact. Carotid duplex, 1/18/93: RICA 0-15%, LICA 16-49% stenosis and normal vertebral artery flow bilaterally. Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE),1/18/93: revealed severe aortic fibrosis or valvular calcification with ""severe"" aortic stenosis in the face of ""normal"" LV function. Cardiology felt the patient the patient had asymptomatic aortic stenosis. EEG, 1/20/93, showed low voltage Delta over the left posterior quadrant and intermittent background slowing over the same region consistent with focal dysfunction in this quadrant. MRI Brain, 1/22/93: multiple focal and more confluent areas of increased T2 signal in the periventricular white matter, more prominent on the left; in addition, there were irregular shaped areas of increased T2 signal and decreased T1 signal in both cerebellar hemispheres; and age related atrophy; incidentally, there is a cavum septum pellucidum et vergae and mucosal thickening of the maxillary sinuses. Impression: diffuse bilateral age related ischemic change, age related atrophy and maxillary sinus disease. There were no masses or areas of abnormal enhancement. TSH, FT4, Vit B12, VDRL, Urine drug and heavy metal screens were unremarkable. CSF,1/19/93: glucose 102 (serum glucose 162mg/dL), Protein 45mg/dL, RBC O, WBC O, Cultures negative. SPEP negative. However serum and CSF beta2 microglobulin levels were elevated at 2.5 and 3.1mg/L, respectively. Hematology felt these may have been false positives. CBC, 1/17/93: Hgb 10.4g/dL (low), HCT 31% (low), RBC 3/34mil/mm3 (low), WBC 5.8K/mm3, Plt 201K/mm3. Retic 30/1K/mm3 (normal). Serum Iron 35mcg/dL (low), TIBC 201mcg/dL (low), FeSat 17% (low), CRP 0.1mg/dL (normal), ESR 83mm/hr (high). Bone Marrow Bx: normal with adequate iron stores. Hematology felt the finding were compatible with anemia of chronic disease. Neuropsychologic evaluation on 1/17/93 revealed significant impairments in multiple realms of cognitive function (visuospatial reasoning, verbal and visual memory, visual confrontational naming, impaired arrhythmatic, dysfluent speech marked by use of phrases no longer than 5 words, frequent word finding difficulty and semantic paraphasic errors) most severe for expressive language, attention and memory. The pattern of findings reveals an atypical aphasia suggestive of left temporo-parietal dysfunction. The patient was discharged1/22/93 on ASA 325mg qd. He was given a diagnosis of senile chorea and dementia (unspecified type). 6/18/93 repeat Neuropsychological evaluation revealed moderate decline in all areas tested reflecting severe dementia.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?

COURSE:
CT Brain showed large, enhancing 4 x 4 x 3 cm suprasellar-sellar mass without surrounding edema. Differential dx: included craniopharyngioma, pituitary adenoma, and aneurysm. MRI Brain findings were consistent with an aneurysm. The patient underwent 3 vessel cerebral angiogram on 12/29/92. This clearly revealed a supraclinoid giant aneurysm of the left internal carotid artery. Ten minutes following contrast injection the patient became aphasic and developed a right hemiparesis. Emergent HCT showed no evidence of hemorrhage or sign of infarct. Emergent carotid duplex showed no significant stenosis or clot. The patient was left with an expressive aphasia and right hemiparesis. SPECT scans were obtained on 1/7/93 and 2/24/93. They revealed hypoperfusion in the distribution of the left MCA and decreased left basal-ganglia perfusion which may represent in part a mass effect from the LICA aneurysm. She was discharged home and returned and underwent placement of a Selverstone Clamp on 3/9/93. The clamp was gradually and finally closed by 3/14/93. She did well, and returned home. On 3/20/93 she developed sudden confusion associated with worsening of her right hemiparesis and right expressive aphasia. A HCT then showed SAH around her aneurysm, which had thrombosed.

"EXAM:
CT examination of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast.
INDICATIONS:
Abdominal pain.
TECHNIQUE:
CT examination of the abdomen and pelvis was performed after 100 mL of intravenous Isovue-300 contrast administration.  Oral contrast was not administered.  There was no comparison of studies.
FINDINGS,CT PELVIS:
Within the pelvis, the uterus demonstrates a thickened-appearing endometrium.  There is also a 4.4 x 2.5 x 3.4 cm hypodense mass in the cervix and lower uterine segment of uncertain etiology.  There is also a 2.5 cm intramural hypodense mass involving the dorsal uterine fundus likely representing a fibroid.  Several smaller fibroids were also suspected.
The ovaries are unremarkable in appearance.  There is no free pelvic fluid or adenopathy.
CT ABDOMEN:
The appendix has normal appearance in the right lower quadrant.  There are few scattered diverticula in the sigmoid colon without evidence of diverticulitis.  The small and large bowels are otherwise unremarkable.  The stomach is grossly unremarkable.  There is no abdominal or retroperitoneal adenopathy.  There are no adrenal masses.  The kidneys, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas are in unremarkable appearance.  The spleen contains several small calcified granulomas, but no evidence of masses.  It is normal in size.  The lung bases are clear bilaterally.  The osseous structures are unremarkable other than mild facet degenerative changes at L4-L5 and L5-S1.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Hypoattenuating mass in the lower uterine segment and cervix of uncertain etiology measuring approximately 4.4 x 2.5 x 3.4 cm.
2.  Multiple uterine fibroids.
3.  Prominent endometrium.
4.  Followup pelvic ultrasound is recommended.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?

[doctor] okay, let's take a look at the results. it looks like you have a hypodense mass in the lower uterine segment and cervix, measuring approximately 4.4 x 2.5 x 3.4 cm. there are also multiple uterine fibroids and a prominent endometrium. we recommend a follow-up pelvic ultrasound to further evaluate the mass.
[patient] what does that mean? do i have cancer?
[doctor] we can't say for sure without further testing. the mass is of uncertain etiology, meaning we're not sure what's causing it. it could be benign or malignant, but we won't know until we do more tests. however, it's important to note that not all masses are cancerous. we need to do more testing to determine what it is.
[patient] okay, what should i do next?
[doctor] we recommend that you schedule a follow-up pelvic ultrasound for further evaluation. depending on the results of that test, we may need to do a biopsy to determine the nature of the mass.

[doctor] i am sorry to hear that. we performed a ct scan of your abdomen and pelvis and the result shows that you have acute appendicitis. it means your appendix is inflamed and needs to be removed.
[patient] do i need surgery?
[doctor] yes, we need to remove the inflamed appendix through surgery. if we don't remove it, it can rupture and cause a serious infection in your body. but don't worry, it's a routine surgery and you will be under anesthesia the whole time.
[patient] how long will it take me to recover?
[doctor] recovery time varies from person to person, but most people can go home the next day and resume normal activities within one to two weeks. you will need to take it easy for a few days after the surgery and avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activities.
[patient] okay, when can we schedule the surgery?
[doctor] we can schedule it as soon as possible. i will consult with a surgeon and we will let you know the date and time. in the meantime, i will prescribe some antibiotics and painkillers to manage your symptoms. don't hesitate to call us if you have any questions or concerns.","[doctor] hey! how are you feeling today?

"CC:
Left-sided weakness.
HX:
This 28y/o RHM was admitted to a local hospital on 6/30/95 for a 7 day history of fevers, chills, diaphoresis, anorexia, urinary frequency, myalgias and generalized weakness. He denied foreign travel, IV drug abuse, homosexuality, recent dental work, or open wound. Blood and urine cultures were positive for Staphylococcus Aureus, oxacillin sensitive. He was place on appropriate antibiotic therapy according to sensitivity.. A 7/3/95 transthoracic echocardiogram revealed normal left ventricular function and a damaged mitral valve with regurgitation. Later that day he developed left-sided weakness and severe dysarthria and aphasia. HCT, on 7/3/95 revealed mild attenuated signal in the right hemisphere. On 7/4/95 he developed first degree AV block, and was transferred to UIHC.

COURSE:
7/6/95, HCT showed a large RMCA stroke with mass shift. His neurologic exam worsened and he was intubated, hyperventilated, and given IV Mannitol. He then underwent emergent left craniectomy and duraplasty. He tolerated the procedure well and his brain was allowed to swell. He then underwent mitral valve replacement on 7/11/95 with a St. Judes valve. His post-operative recovery was complicated by pneumonia, pericardial effusion and dysphagia. He required temporary PEG placement for feeding. The 7/27/95, 8/6/95 and 10/18/96 HCT scans show the chronologic neuroradiologic documentation of a large RMCA stroke. His 10/18/96 Neurosurgery Clinic visit noted that he can ambulate without assistance with the use of a leg brace to prevent left foot drop. His proximal LLE strength was rated at a 4. His LUE was plegic. He had a seizure 6 days prior to his 10/18/96 evaluation. This began as a Jacksonian march of shaking in the LUE; then involved the LLE. There was no LOC or tongue-biting. He did have urinary incontinence. He was placed on DPH. His speech was dysarthric but fluent. He appeared bright, alert and oriented in all spheres.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?

"CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST AND CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST,REASON FOR EXAM:
Generalized abdominal pain with swelling at the site of the ileostomy.
TECHNIQUE:
Axial CT images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained utilizing 100 mL of Isovue-300.
CT ABDOMEN:
The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable.  Punctate calcifications in the gallbladder lumen likely represent a gallstone.
CT PELVIS:
Postsurgical changes of a left lower quadrant ileostomy are again seen.  There is no evidence for an obstruction.  A partial colectomy and diverting ileostomy is seen within the right lower quadrant.  The previously seen 3.4 cm subcutaneous fluid collection has resolved.  Within the left lower quadrant, a 3.4 cm x 2.5 cm loculated fluid collection has not significantly changed.  This is adjacent to the anastomosis site and a pelvic abscess cannot be excluded.  No obstruction is seen.  The appendix is not clearly visualized.  The urinary bladder is unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Resolution of the previously seen subcutaneous fluid collection.
2.  Left pelvic 3.4 cm fluid collection has not significantly changed in size or appearance.  These findings may be due to a pelvic abscess.
3.  Right lower quadrant ileostomy has not significantly changed.
4.  Cholelithiasis.","[doctor]: hello! so we received your ct scan results, how are you feeling?
[patient]: hi, i'm in pain and worried about the results.
[doctor]: i understand, let me explain what we saw. your liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys all look normal, which is great news. we did find that you have gallstones, which is called cholelithiasis, but that may not be causing your current pain. 
[patient]: okay, what about the swelling at the site of the ileostomy?
[doctor]: we did see postsurgical changes of a left lower quadrant ileostomy and no evidence of obstruction. the right lower quadrant ileostomy is unchanged. however, we did find a 3.4 cm x 2.5 cm fluid collection in the left pelvic area near the anastomosis site. this could be a pelvic abscess, so we need to further investigate that.
[patient]: does that mean i'll need surgery again?
[doctor]: not necessarily, we may be able to treat the abscess with antibiotics. but we will discuss the best course of action once we know more. the good news is that the previously seen subcutaneous fluid collection has resolved.

Evaluation of the bladder is limited due to the presence of a Foley catheter, the bladder is nondistended.  The large and small bowels are normal in course and caliber.  There is no obstruction.
Bibasilar pleural effusions are noted.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence for retroperitoneal bleed.
2. There are two left-sided cystic lesions within the kidney, correlation with a postcontrast study versus further characterization with an ultrasound is advised as the cystic lesions appear slightly larger as compared to the prior exam.
3. The kidneys are small in size bilaterally.
4. Bibasilar pleural effusions.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?

"EXAM:
CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast, stone protocol, reconstruction.
REASON FOR EXAM:
Flank pain.
TECHNIQUE:
Noncontrast CT abdomen and pelvis with coronal reconstructions.
FINDINGS:
There is no intrarenal stone bilaterally.  However, there is very mild left renal pelvis and proximal ureteral dilatation with a small amount of left perinephric stranding asymmetric to the right.  The right renal pelvis is not dilated.  There is no stone along the course of the ureter.  I cannot exclude the possibility of recent stone passage, although the findings are ultimately technically indeterminate and clinical correlation is advised.  There is no obvious solid-appearing mass given the lack of contrast.
Scans of the pelvis disclose no evidence of stone within the decompressed bladder.  No pelvic free fluid or adenopathy.
There are few scattered diverticula.  There is a moderate amount of stool throughout the colon.  There are scattered diverticula, but no CT evidence of acute diverticulitis.  The appendix is normal.
There are mild bibasilar atelectatic changes.
Given the lack of contrast, visualized portions of the liver, spleen, adrenal glands, and the pancreas are grossly unremarkable.  The gallbladder is present.  There is no abdominal free fluid or pathologic adenopathy.
There are degenerative changes of the lumbar spine.
IMPRESSION:
1.Very mild left renal pelvic dilatation and proximal ureteral dilatation with mild left perinephric stranding.  There is no stone identified along the course of the left ureter or in the bladder.  Could this patient be status post recent stone passage?  Clinical correlation is advised.
2.Diverticulosis.

"EXAM:
CT pelvis with contrast and ct abdomen with and without contrast.
INDICATIONS:
Abnormal liver enzymes and diarrhea.
TECHNIQUE:
CT examination of the abdomen and pelvis was performed after 100 mL of intravenous contrast administration and oral contrast administration.  Pre-contrast images through the abdomen were also obtained.
COMPARISON:
There were no comparison studies.
FINDINGS:
The lung bases are clear.
The liver demonstrates mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.  These findings may be secondary to the patient's post cholecystectomy state.  The pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable.
There is a 13 mm peripheral-enhancing fluid collection in the anterior pararenal space of uncertain etiology.  There are numerous nonspecific retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes.  These may be reactive; however, an early neoplastic process would be difficult to totally exclude.
There is a right inguinal hernia containing a loop of small bowel.  This may produce a partial obstruction as there is mild fluid distention of several small bowel loops, particularly in the right lower quadrant.  The large bowel demonstrates significant diverticulosis coli of the sigmoid and distal descending colon without evidence of diverticulitis.
There is diffuse osteopenia along with significant degenerative changes in the lower lumbar spine.
The urinary bladder is unremarkable.  The uterus is not visualized.

[patient]: what does that mean?
[doctor]: the lymph nodes may be reactive, meaning your body is fighting off an infection, but we need to make sure there isn't an early neoplastic process. we also found a 13mm fluid collection in the anterior pararenal space of uncertain cause. you have diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis, and mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation due to your past cholecystectomy. lastly, you have osteopenia and degenerative changes in your spine and pelvis.

"EXAM:
CT of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast.
HISTORY:
Lower abdominal pain.
FINDINGS:
Limited views of the lung bases demonstrate linear density most likely representing dependent atelectasis.  There is a 1.6 cm nodular density at the left posterior sulcus.
Noncontrast technique limits evaluation of the solid abdominal organs.  Cardiomegaly and atherosclerotic calcifications are seen.
Hepatomegaly is observed.  There is calcification within the right lobe of the liver likely related to granulomatous changes.  Subtle irregularity of the liver contour is noted, suggestive of cirrhosis.  There is splenomegaly seen.  There are two low-attenuation lesions seen in the posterior aspect of the spleen, which are incompletely characterized that may represent splenic cyst.  The pancreas appears atrophic.  There is a left renal nodule seen, which measures 1.9 cm with a Hounsfield unit density of approximately 29, which is indeterminate.
There is mild bilateral perinephric stranding.  There is an 8-mm fat density lesion in the anterior inner polar region of the left kidney, compatible in appearance with angiomyolipoma.  There is a 1-cm low-attenuation lesion in the upper pole of the right kidney, likely representing a cyst, but incompletely characterized on this examination.  Bilateral ureters appear normal in caliber along their visualized course.  The bladder is partially distended with urine, but otherwise unremarkable.
Postsurgical changes of hysterectomy are noted.  There are pelvic phlebolith seen.  There is a calcified soft tissue density lesion in the right pelvis, which may represent an ovary with calcification, as it appears continuous with the right gonadal vein.
Scattered colonic diverticula are observed.  The appendix is within normal limits.  The small bowel is unremarkable.  There is an anterior abdominal wall hernia noted containing herniated mesenteric fat.  The hernia neck measures approximately 2.7 cm.  There is stranding of the fat within the hernia sac.
There are extensive degenerative changes of the right hip noted with changes suggestive of avascular necrosis.  Degenerative changes of the spine are observed.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Anterior abdominal wall hernia with mesenteric fat-containing stranding, suggestive of incarcerated fat.
2.  Nodule in the left lower lobe, recommend follow up in 3 months.
3.  Indeterminate left adrenal nodule, could be further assessed with dedicated adrenal protocol CT or MRI.

[patient] hi, i've been having some lower abdominal pain.
[doctor] i see. we received the results of your recent ct scan and i would like to go over them with you. the scan showed a few things that we need to take a closer look at. 
[patient] okay, what did you find?
[doctor] we observed an anterior abdominal wall hernia with mesenteric fat-containing stranding, suggestive of incarcerated fat. there is also a nodule in the left lower lobe of your lung that we would like to follow up on in 3 months. we also found an indeterminate left adrenal nodule that could be further assessed with a dedicated adrenal protocol ct or mri. additionally, the scan showed that you have hepatomegaly with changes suggestive of cirrhosis, splenomegaly, and low-attenuation lesions in the spleen that may represent cysts. we also observed a fat density lesion in your left kidney that is likely an angiomyolipoma and a fat density soft tissue lesion in the region of the right adnexa that contains calcifications and may represent an ovary or possibly a dermoid cyst.
[patient] oh, wow, that's a lot. what do we do next?
[doctor] we will need to schedule some follow-up tests to take a closer look at the nodules and lesions that were found. for the hernia, we may need to consider surgical intervention to prevent the possibility of future complications. for the liver and spleen abnormalities, we may need to perform additional imaging studies to determine the extent of the damage or any underlying conditions. the kidney angiomyolipoma and the adnexa lesion will also need to be followed up on with further tests.

"EXAM:
CT Abdomen & Pelvis W&WO Contrast,
REASON FOR EXAM:
Status post aortobiiliac graft repair.

TECHNIQUE:
5 mm spiral thick spiral CT scanning was performed through the entire abdomen and pelvis utilizing intravenous dynamic bolus contrast enhancement.  No oral or rectal contrast was utilized.  Comparison is made with the prior CT abdomen and pelvis dated 10/20/05.  There has been no significant change in size of the abdominal aortic aneurysm centered roughly at the renal artery origin level which has dimensions of 3.7 cm transversely x 3.4 AP.  Just below this level is the top of the endoluminal graft repair with numerous surrounding surgical clips.  The size of the native aneurysm component at this level is stable at 5.5 cm in diameter with mural thrombus surrounding the enhancing endolumen.  There is no abnormal entrance of contrast agent into the mural thrombus to indicate an endoluminal leak.  Further distally, there is extension of the graft into both proximal common iliac arteries without evidence for endoluminal leak at this level either.  No exoluminal leakage is identified at any level.  There is no retroperitoneal hematoma present.  The findings are unchanged from the prior exam.
The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenals and right kidney are unremarkable with moderate diffuse atrophy of the pancreas present.  There is advanced atrophy of the left kidney.  No hydronephrosis is present.  No acute findings are identified elsewhere in the abdomen.
The lung bases are clear.
Concerning the remainder of the pelvis, no acute pathology is identified.  There is prominent streak artifact from the left total hip replacement.  There is diffuse moderate sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence for diverticulitis.  The bladder grossly appears normal.  A hysterectomy has been performed.
IMPRESSION:
1.  No complications identified regarding endoluminal aortoiliac graft repair as described.  The findings are stable compared to the study of 10/20/04.
2.  Stable mild aneurysm of aortic aneurysm, centered roughly at renal artery level.
3.  No other acute findings noted.
4.  Advanced left renal atrophy.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm feeling fine, thank you.
[doctor] that's good to hear. i just wanted to go over the results of your recent ct scan. it looks like there were no complications identified regarding your endoluminal aortoiliac graft repair, and the findings are stable compared to the previous study in 2004.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] there is a stable mild aneurysm of the abdominal aortic aneurysm, centered roughly at the renal artery level. there is also advanced atrophy of the left kidney, but no other acute findings were noted. do you have any questions about the results?
[patient] no, i don't think so.","[doctor] alright then, um, i just want to make sure that you are aware of the results. it's great to hear that everything is stable and no acute findings were noted. do you need any more information about your kidney atrophy or the mild aneurysm?

"CARDIAC CT INCLUDING CORONARY CT ANGIOGRAPHY,PROCEDURE:
Breath hold cardiac CT was performed using a 64-channel CT scanner with a 0.5-second rotation time.  Contrast injection was timed using a 10 mL bolus of Ultravist 370 IV.  Then the patient received 75 mL of Ultravist 370 at a rate of 5 mL/sec.
Retrospective ECG gating was performed.  The patient received 0.4 milligrams of sublingual nitroglycerin prior to the to the scan.  The average heart rate was 62 beats/min.
The patient had no adverse reaction to the contrast.  Multiphase retrospective reconstructions were performed.  Small field of view cardiac and coronary images were analyzed on a 3D work station.  Multiplanar reformatted images and 3D volume rendering was performed by the attending physician for the purpose of defining coronary anatomy and determining the extent of coronary artery disease.
CORONARY CTA:
1.  The technical quality of the scan is adequate.
2.  The coronary ostia are in their normal position.  The coronary anatomy is right dominant.
3.  LEFT MAIN:  The left main coronary artery is patent without angiographic stenosis.
4.  LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY:  The proximal aspect of the left anterior descending artery demonstrates a mixed plaque consisting of both calcified and noncalcified lesion which is less than 30% in stenosis severity.  Diagonal 1 and diagonal 2 branches of the left anterior descending artery demonstrate mild irregularities.
5.  The ramus intermedius is a small vessel with minor irregularities.
6.  LEFT CIRCUMFLEX:  The left circumflex and obtuse marginal 1 and obtuse marginal 2 branches of the vessel are patent without significant stenosis.
7.  RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY:  The right coronary artery is a large and dominant vessel.  It demonstrates within its mid-segment calcified atherosclerosis, less than 50% stenosis severity.  Left ventricular ejection fraction is calculated to be 69%.  There are no wall motion abnormalities.
8.  Coronary calcium score was calculated to be 79, indicating at least mild atherosclerosis within the coronary vessels.
ANCILLARY FINDINGS:
None.
FINAL IMPRESSION:
1.  Mild coronary artery disease with a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction of 69%.
2.  Recommendation is aggressive medical management consisting of aggressive lifestyle modifications and statin therapy.

2.  Rest of visualized exam nonacute/stable.
3.  Left central line appropriately situated and stable.
4.  Preliminary report was issued at time of dictation.  Dr. X was called for results.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, i'm here because i have been experiencing shortness of breath.
[doctor] okay, let me take a look at your chest x-ray here. hmm, it looks like there has been a development of a moderate left-sided pneumothorax with almost complete collapse of the left upper lobe.
[patient] what does that mean?
[doctor] it means that there is air leaking into the space between your lung and chest wall, causing your left lung to partially collapse. we need to keep an eye on this and make sure it doesn't get worse. the rest of the exam shows no acute issues, and your left central line is properly placed and stable.
[patient] is there anything that can be done about this?
[doctor] we will need to monitor the pneumothorax closely to see if it resolves on its own or if we need to intervene. in the meantime, i recommend resting and avoiding any strenuous activity. we will follow up with another chest x-ray to see if there are any changes.

Intermittent binocular horizontal, vertical, and torsional diplopia.
HX:
70y/o RHM referred by Neuro-ophthalmology for evaluation of neuromuscular disease. In 7/91, he began experiencing intermittent binocular horizontal, vertical and torsional diplopia which was worse and frequent at the end of the day, and was eliminated when closing one either eye. An MRI Brain scan at that time was unremarkable. He was seen at UIHC Strabismus Clinic in 5/93 for these symptoms. On exam, he was found to have intermittent right hypertropia in primary gaze, and consistent diplopia in downward and rightward gaze. This was felt to possibly represent Grave's disease. Thyroid function studies were unremarkable, but orbital echography suggested Graves orbitopathy. The patient was then seen in the Neuro-ophthalmology clinic on 12/23/92. His exam remained unchanged. He underwent Tensilon testing which was unremarkable. On 1/13/93, he was seen again in Neuro-ophthalmology. His exam remained relatively unchanged and repeat Tensilon testing was unremarkable. He then underwent a partial superior rectus resection, OD, with only mild improvement of his diplopia. During his 8/27/96 Neuro-ophthalmology clinic visit he was noted to have hypertropia OD with left pseudogaze palsy and a right ptosis. The ptosis improved upon administration of Tensilon and he was placed on Mestinon 30mg tid. His diplopia subsequently improved, but did not resolve. The dosage was increased to 60mg tid and his diplopia worsened and the dose decreased back to 30mg tid. At present he denied any fatigue on repetitive movement. He denied dysphagia, SOB, dysarthria, facial weakness, fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss or muscle atrophy.

MS: Unremarkable. Normal speech with no dysarthria.
CN: Right hypertropia (worse on rightward gaze and less on leftward gaze). Minimal to no ptosis, OD. No ptosis, OS. VFFTC. No complaint of diplopia. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable.
MOTOR: 5/5 strength throughout with normal muscle bulk and tone.
SENSORY: No deficits appreciated on PP/VIB/LT/PROP/TEMP testing.
Coordination/Station/Gait: Unremarkable.
Reflexes: 2/2 throughout. Plantar responses were flexor on the right and withdrawal on the left.
HEENT and GEN EXAM: Unremarkable.
COURSE:
EMG/NCV, 9/26/96: Repetitive stimulation studies of the median, facial, and spinal accessory nerves showed no evidence of decrement at baseline, and at intervals up to 3 minutes following exercise. The patient had been off Mestinon for 8 hours prior to testing. Chest CT with contrast, 9/26/96, revealed a 4x2.5x4cm centrally calcified soft tissue anterior mediastinal mass adjacent to the aortic arch. This was highly suggestive of a thymoma. There were diffuse emphysematous disease with scarring in the lung bases. A few nodules suggestive of granulomas and few calcified perihilar lymph nodes. He underwent thoracotomy and resection of the mass. Pathologic analysis was consistent with a thymoma, lymphocyte predominant type, with capsular and pleural invasion, and extension to the phrenic nerve resection margin. Acetylcholine Receptor-binding antibody titer 12.8nmol/L (normal<0.7), Acetylcholine receptor blocking antibody <10% (normal), Acetylcholine receptor modulating antibody 42% (normal<19), Striated muscle antibody 1:320 (normal<1:10). Striated muscle antibody titers tend to be elevated in myasthenia gravis associated with thymoma.

[patient] yeah, i was seen at uihc strabismus clinic and neuro-ophthalmology clinic.
[doctor] okay, what did they say?
[patient] they found that i had consistent diplopia in downward and rightward gaze and intermittent right hypertropia in primary gaze. they suspected it might be graves' disease, but my thyroid function studies were unremarkable.
[doctor] okay, got it. did you undergo any testing?
[patient] yeah, i underwent tensilon testing which was unremarkable.
[doctor] alright, did you receive any treatment?
[patient] i underwent a partial superior rectus resection, od, but it only mildly improved my diplopia. i was then placed on mestinon, and my diplopia improved, but did not resolve.
[doctor] i see. did you experience any other symptoms?
[patient] no, i denied any fatigue on repetitive movement, dysphagia, sob, dysarthria, facial weakness, fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss, or muscle atrophy.

"EXAM:
CTA chest pulmonary angio.
REASON FOR EXAM:
Evaluate for pulmonary embolism.
TECHNIQUE:
Postcontrast CT chest pulmonary embolism protocol, 100 mL of Isovue-300 contrast is utilized.
FINDINGS:
There are no filling defects in the main or main right or left pulmonary arteries.  No central embolism.  The proximal subsegmental pulmonary arteries are free of embolus, but the distal subsegmental and segmental arteries especially on the right are limited by extensive pulmonary parenchymal, findings would be discussed in more detail below.  There is no evidence of a central embolism.
As seen on the prior examination, there is a very large heterogeneous right chest wall mass, which measures at least 10 x 12 cm based on axial image #35.  Just superior to the mass is a second heterogeneous focus of neoplasm measuring about 5 x 3.3 cm.  Given the short interval time course from the prior exam, dated 01/23/09, this finding has not significantly changed.  However, there is considerable change in the appearance of the lung fields.  There are now bilateral pleural effusions, small on the right and moderate on the left with associated atelectasis.  There are also extensive right lung consolidations, all new or increased significantly from the prior examination.  Again identified is a somewhat spiculated region of increased density at the right lung apex, which may indicate fibrosis or scarring, but the possibility of primary or metastatic disease cannot be excluded.  There is no pneumothorax in the interval.
On the mediastinal windows, there is presumed subcarinal adenopathy, with one lymph node measuring roughly 12 mm suggestive of metastatic disease here.  There is aortic root and arch and descending thoracic aortic calcification.  There are scattered regions of soft plaque intermixed with this.  The heart is not enlarged.  The left axilla is intact in regards to adenopathy.  The inferior thyroid appears unremarkable.
Limited assessment of the upper abdomen discloses a region of lower density within the right hepatic lobe, this finding is indeterminate, and if there is need for additional imaging in regards to hepatic metastatic disease, follow up ultrasound.  Spleen, adrenal glands, and upper kidneys appear unremarkable.  Visualized portions of the pancreas are unremarkable.
There is extensive rib destruction in the region of the chest wall mass.  There are changes suggesting prior trauma to the right clavicle.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Again demonstrated is a large right chest wall mass.
2.  No central embolus, distal subsegmental and segmental pulmonary artery branches are in part obscured by the pulmonary parenchymal findings, are not well assessed.
3.  New bilateral pleural effusions and extensive increasing consolidations and infiltrates in the right lung.
4.  See above regarding other findings.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling?
[patient] i'm okay, just a little tired.
[doctor] i understand that. i just want to go over the results of your ct scan. we didn't find any blood clots in your main pulmonary arteries, but there are some issues we need to discuss.
[patient] okay, what's going on?
[doctor] there's a large mass in your right chest wall that we saw on the previous exam, and it appears to be unchanged in size. we also found some new bilateral pleural effusions, which are pockets of fluid around your lungs, and extensive lung consolidations and infiltrates on your right lung. there is also some damage to your ribs in the area of the chest wall mass.
[patient] that doesn't sound good.
[doctor] we also found some lymph nodes in your subcarinal area that are suggestive of metastatic disease. we'll need to do further testing to confirm that. we did see some calcification in your aorta and some regions of soft plaque, which we'll want to monitor. we also found a region of lower density in your right hepatic lobe, but we'll need to do additional imaging to determine if it's metastatic disease.
[patient] what does this all mean?
[doctor] we need to do some more tests to determine the cause of your lung issues and confirm if there is any metastatic disease. we'll also want to monitor the calcification in your aorta and the region of lower density in your liver. i'll refer you to a specialist who can help us determine the best course of action moving forward.
[patient] okay, what can i expect in terms of treatment?
[doctor] once we determine the cause of your lung issues, we can discuss treatment options. it may involve surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy, depending on what we find. we'll work with you to come up with the best plan for your specific situation.

"EXAM:
Carotid and cerebral arteriograms.
INDICATION:
Abnormal carotid duplex studies demonstrating occlusion of the left internal carotid artery.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Complete occlusion of the left common carotid artery approximately 3 cm distal to its origin.
2.  Mild stenosis of the right internal carotid artery measured at 20%.
3.  Patent bilateral vertebral arteries.
4.  No significant disease was identified of the anterior cerebral vessels.
DISCUSSION:
Carotid and cerebral arteriograms were performed on Month DD, YYYY, previous studies are not available for comparison.
The right groin was sterilely cleansed and draped.  Lidocaine 1% buffered with sodium bicarbonate was used as local anesthetic.  A 19-French needle was then advanced into the common femoral artery and a wire was advanced.  Over the wire, a sheath was placed.  A wire was then advanced into the abdominal aorta and over the wire and the flushed catheter was then advanced to the arch of the aorta over a wire.  Flushed arteriogram was performed.  Arteriogram demonstrated no significant disease of the great vessels at their origins.  There is demonstration of complete occlusion of the left common carotid artery approximately 3 cm distal to its origin.  The vertebral arteries were widely patent.  Following this, the flushed catheter was exchanged for ***** catheter and selective catheterization of the common carotid artery on the right was performed.  Carotid and cerebral arteriograms were performed.  The carotid arteriograms on the right demonstrated the carotid bulb to be unremarkable.  The external carotid artery on the right is quite tortuous in its appearance.  The internal carotid artery demonstrates a mild plaque creating stenosis, which is measured approximately 20%.  Cerebral arteriogram on the right demonstrated the A1 and M1 segments bilaterally to be normal.  No significant stenosis identified.  There is complete cross-filling into the left brain via the right.  No significant stenosis was appreciated.
Following this, the catheter was parked at the origin of the left common carotid artery and ejection demonstrated complete occlusion.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  No complications occurred during or immediately after the procedure.  Stasis was achieved of the puncture site using a VasoSeal.  The patient will be observed for at least 2-1/2 hours prior to being discharged to home.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?

"CARDIOLITE TREADMILL EXERCISE STRESS TEST,CLINICAL DATA:
This is a 72-year-old female with history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and right bundle branch block.
PROCEDURE:
The patient was exercised on the treadmill to maximum tolerance achieving after 5 minutes a peak heart rate of 137 beats per minute with a workload of 2.3 METS.  There was a normal blood pressure response.  The patient did not complain of any symptoms during the test and other than the right bundle branch block that was present at rest, no other significant electrographic abnormalities were observed.
Myocardial perfusion imaging was performed at rest following the injection of 10 mCi Tc-99 Cardiolite.  At peak pharmacological effect, the patient was injected with 30 mCi Tc-99 Cardiolite.
Gating poststress tomographic imaging was performed 30 minutes after the stress.
FINDINGS:
1.  The overall quality of the study is fair.
2.  The left ventricular cavity appears to be normal on the rest and stress studies.
3.  SPECT images demonstrate fairly homogeneous tracer distribution throughout the myocardium with no overt evidences of fixed and/or reperfusion defect.
4.  The left ventricular ejection fraction was normal and estimated to be 78%.
IMPRESSION:
Myocardial perfusion imaging is normal.  Result of this test suggests low probability for significant coronary artery disease.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i am good, thank you.
[doctor] i wanted to talk to you about the results of your recent cardiolite treadmill exercise stress test.
[patient] oh, sure.
[doctor] the test shows normal myocardial perfusion imaging, which is great news. it suggests a low probability for significant coronary artery disease.
[patient] that's a relief to hear.
[doctor] yes, it is. during the test, you exercised on the treadmill to maximum tolerance and achieved a peak heart rate of 137 beats per minute with a workload of 2.3 mets. your blood pressure response was normal, and you did not complain of any symptoms during the test. other than the right bundle branch block that was present at rest, no other significant electrographic abnormalities were observed.
[patient] i see.
[doctor] we also performed myocardial perfusion imaging at rest and at peak pharmacological effect. the spect images demonstrate fairly homogeneous tracer distribution throughout the myocardium with no overt evidences of fixed and/or reperfusion defect. the left ventricular ejection fraction was normal and estimated to be 78%.
[patient] okay.

[patient] um, i'm good, thank you.
[doctor] uh, i wanted to talk to you about the results of your recent cardiolite treadmill exercise stress test.
[patient] oh, sure. mm-hmm
[doctor] the test shows normal myocardial perfusion imaging, which is great news. um, it suggests a low probability for significant coronary artery disease.
[patient] oh, that's a relief to hear. mm-hmm
[doctor] yes, it is. um, during the test, you exercised on the treadmill to maximum tolerance and achieved a peak heart rate of 137 beats per minute with a workload of 2.3 mets. um, your blood pressure response was normal, and you did not complain of any symptoms during the test. other than the right bundle branch block that was present at rest, no other significant electrographic abnormalities were observed.
[patient] oh, i see. mm-hmm
[doctor] we also performed myocardial perfusion imaging at rest and at peak pharmacological effect. the spect images demonstrate fairly homogeneous tracer distribution throughout the myocardium with no overt evidences of fixed and/or reperfusion defect. the left ventricular ejection fraction was normal and estimated to be 78%.

"EXAM:
Bilateral carotid ultrasound.
REASON FOR EXAM:
Headache.
TECHNIQUE:
Color grayscale and Doppler analysis is employed.
FINDINGS:
On the grayscale images, the right common carotid artery demonstrates patency with mild intimal thickening only.  At the level of the carotid bifurcation, there is heterogeneous hard plaque present, but without grayscale evidence of greater than 50% stenosis.  Right common carotid waveform is normal with a peak systolic velocity of 0.474 m/second and an end-diastolic velocity of 0.131 m/second.  The right ECA is patent as well with the velocity measurement 0.910 m/second.
The right internal carotid artery at the bifurcation demonstrates plaque formation, but no evidence of greater than 50% stenosis.  Proximal peak systolic velocity in the internal carotid artery is 0.463 m/second with proximal end-diastolic velocity of 0.170.  The mid internal carotid peak systolic velocity is 0.564 m/second, and mid ICA end-diastolic velocity is 0.199 m/second.  Right ICA distal PSV 0.580 m/second, right ICA distal EDV 0.204 m/second.  Vertebral flow is antegrade on the right at 0.469 m/second.
On the left, the common carotid artery demonstrates intimal thickening, but is otherwise patent.  At the level of the bifurcation, however, there is more pronounced plaque formation with approximately 50% stenosis by the grayscale analysis.  See the velocity measurements below:
Left carotid ECA measurement 0.938 m/second.  Left common carotid PSV 0.686 m/second, and left common carotid end-diastolic velocity 0.137 m/second.
Left internal carotid artery again demonstrates prominent focus of hard plaque with up to at least 50% stenosis.  This should be further assessed with CTA for more precise measurement.  The left proximal ICA/PSV 0.955 m/second, left proximal ICA/EDV 0.287 m/second.  There is spectral broadening in the proximal aspect of the carotid waveform.  The left carotid ICA mid PSV 0.895, left carotid ICA mid EDV 0.278 with also spectral broadening present.
The left distal ICA/PSV 0.561, left distal ICA/EDV 0.206, again the spectral broadening present.  Vertebral flow is antegrade at 0.468 m/second.
IMPRESSION:
The study demonstrates bilateral hard plaque at the bifurcation, left greater than right.  There is at least 50% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery at its bifurcation and a followup CTA is recommended for further assessment.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?
[patient] i'm not doing well, doctor. i have been experiencing headaches and i'm worried that it could be something serious.
[doctor] i understand. i ordered a bilateral carotid ultrasound for you to investigate the cause of your headaches. the results show that there is bilateral hard plaque at the bifurcation, which is more pronounced on the left side. there is at least 50% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery at its bifurcation, and i recommend a follow-up cta for more precise measurements.
[patient] what does that mean, doctor?
[doctor] essentially, there are blockages in the carotid arteries in your neck, which could be the cause of your headaches. the blockage on the left side is more significant than the right. we need to investigate further to determine the severity of the blockage and plan for further treatment if necessary.
[patient] what kind of treatment?
[doctor] depending on the severity, we may need to consider a surgical procedure to remove the blockage or stent placement to widen the artery. however, we won't know for sure until we get the results of the follow-up cta.
[patient] okay, thank you, doctor.
[doctor] of course. in the meantime, i can prescribe some medication to help with your headaches.
[patient] that would be great, thank you.

"PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
1.  Selective ascending aortic arch angiogram.
2.  Selective left common carotid artery angiogram.
3.  Selective right common carotid artery angiogram.
4.  Selective left subclavian artery angiogram.
5.  Right iliac angio with runoff.
6.  Bilateral cerebral angiograms were performed as well via right and left common carotid artery injections.
INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:
TIA, aortic stenosis, postoperative procedure.  Moderate carotid artery stenosis.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
400 ml.
SPECIMENS REMOVED:
Not applicable.
TECHNIQUE OF PROCEDURE:
After obtaining informed consent, the patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization suite in postabsorptive and nonsedated state.  The right groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Lidocaine 2% was used for infiltration anesthesia.  Using modified Seldinger technique, a 6-French sheath was placed into the right common femoral artery and vein without complication.  Using injection through the side port of the sheath, a right iliac angiogram with runoff was performed.  Following this, straight pigtail catheter was used to advance the aortic arch and aortic arch angiogram under digital subtraction was performed.  Following this, selective engagement in left common carotid artery, right common carotid artery, and left subclavian artery angiograms were performed with a V-Tech catheter over an 0.035-inch wire.
ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:
1.  Type 2 aortic arch.
2.  Left subclavian artery was patent.
3 Left vertebral artery was patent.
4.  Left internal carotid artery had a 40% to 50% lesion with ulceration, not treated and there was no cerebral cross over.
5.  Right common carotid artery had a 60% to 70% lesion which was heavily calcified and was not treated with the summed left-to-right cross over flow.
6.  Closure was with a 6-French Angio-Seal of the artery, and the venous sheath was sutured in.
PLAN:
Continue aspirin, Plavix, and Coumadin to an INR of 2 with a carotid duplex followup.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] i'm feeling okay, just a little sore at the groin area.
[doctor] that's normal. so we performed a selective ascending aortic arch angiogram, selective left and right common carotid artery angiogram, selective left subclavian artery angiogram, and right iliac angio with runoff. we also did bilateral cerebral angiograms via right and left common carotid artery injections. 
[patient] okay, and what did you find?
[doctor] we found that you have a type 2 aortic arch, which is a common variation. your left subclavian artery and left vertebral artery are patent, which is good. however, you have a moderate stenosis in the left internal carotid artery with ulceration, and a heavily calcified 60-70% stenosis in the right common carotid artery. we did not treat these with summed left-to-right cross over flow. 
[patient] what does that mean?
[doctor] it means that we did not perform any interventions to treat the stenosis during the procedure. we will continue with your current medications, aspirin, plavix, and coumadin to maintain an inr of 2. we will also schedule a carotid duplex follow-up to monitor the progression of the stenosis.
[patient] okay, i understand. 
[doctor] good. is there anything else you would like to know?

"EXAM:
Bilateral diagnostic mammogram, left breast ultrasound and biopsy.
HISTORY:
30-year-old female presents for digital bilateral mammography secondary to a soft tissue lump palpated by the patient in the upper right shoulder.  The patient has a family history of breast cancer within her mother at age 58.  Patient denies personal history of breast cancer.
TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS:
Craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique projections of bilateral breasts were obtained on mm/dd/yy.  An additional lateromedial projection of the right breast was obtained.  The breasts demonstrate heterogeneously-dense fibroglandular tissue.  Within the upper outer aspect of the left breast, there is evidence of a circumscribed density measuring approximately 1 cm x 0.7 cm in diameter.  No additional dominant mass, areas of architectural distortion, or malignant-type calcifications are seen.  Multiple additional benign-appearing calcifications are visualized bilaterally.  Skin overlying both breasts is unremarkable.
Bilateral breast ultrasound was subsequently performed, which demonstrated an ovoid mass measuring approximately 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm in diameter located within the anteromedial aspect of the left shoulder.  This mass demonstrates isoechoic echotexture to the adjacent muscle, with no evidence of internal color flow.  This may represent benign fibrous tissue or a lipoma.
Additional ultrasonographic imaging of the left breast demonstrates a complex circumscribed solid and cystic lesion with hypervascular properties at the 2 o'clock position, measuring 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.8 cm in diameter.  At this time, the lesion was determined to be amenable by ultrasound-guided core biopsy.
The risks and complications of the procedure were discussed with the patient for biopsy of the solid and cystic lesion of the 2 o'clock position of the left breast.  Informed consent was obtained.  The lesion was re-localized under ultrasound guidance.  The left breast was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  2% lidocaine was administered locally for anesthesia.  Additional lidocaine with epinephrine was administered around the distal aspect of the lesion.  A small skin nick was made.  Color Doppler surrounding the lesion demonstrates multiple vessels surrounding the lesion at all sides.  The lateral to medial approach was performed with an 11-gauge Mammotome device.  The device was advanced under ultrasound guidance, with the superior aspect of the lesion placed within the aperture.  Two core biopsies were obtained.  The third core biopsy demonstrated evidence of an expanding hypoechoic area surrounding the lesion, consistent with a rapidly-expanding hematoma.  Arterial blood was visualized exiting the access site.  A biopsy clip was attempted to be placed, however could not be performed secondary to the active hemorrhage.  Therefore, the Mammotome was removed, and direct pressure over the access site and biopsy location was applied for approximately 20 minutes until hemostasis was achieved.  Postprocedural imaging of the 2 o'clock position of the left breast demonstrates evidence of a hematoma measuring approximately 1.9 x 4.4 x 1.3 cm in diameter.  The left breast was re-cleansed with a ChloraPrep, and a pressure bandage and ice packing were applied to the left breast.  The patient was observed in the ultrasound department for the following 30 minutes without complaints.  The patient was subsequently discharged with information and instructions on utilizing the ice bandage.  The obtained specimens were sent to pathology for further analysis.
IMPRESSION:
1.  A mixed solid and cystic lesion at the 2 o'clock position of the left breast was accessed under ultrasound guidance utilizing a Mammotome core biopsy instrument, and multiple core biopsies were obtained.  Transient arterial hemorrhage was noted at the biopsy site, resulting in a localized 4 cm hematoma.  Pressure was applied until hemostasis was achieved.  The patient was monitored for approximately 30 minutes after the procedure, and was ultimately discharged in good condition.  The core biopsies were submitted to pathology for further analysis.
2.  Small isoechoic ovoid mass within the anteromedial aspect of the left shoulder does not demonstrate color flow, and likely represents fibrotic changes or a lipoma.
3.  Suspicious mammographic findings.  The circumscribed density measuring approximately 8 mm at the 2 o'clock position of the left breast was subsequently biopsied.  Further pathologic analysis is pending.
BIRADS Classification 4 - Suspicious findings.
MAMMOGRAPHY INFORMATION:
1.  A certain percentage of cancers, probably 10% to 15%, will not be identified by mammography.
2.  Lack of radiographic evidence of malignancy should not delay a biopsy if a clinically suspicious mass is present.
3.  These images were obtained with FDA-approved digital mammography equipment, and iCAD SecondLook Software Version 7.2 was utilized.","[doctor] hello, how are you doing today?
[patient] i am doing well. thank you.
[doctor] good to hear. let's talk about your test results. the mammogram and ultrasound shows that there is a mixed solid and cystic lesion at the 2 o'clock position of your left breast, which we biopsied. the core biopsies were sent to the laboratory for analysis. meanwhile, we also found a small ovoid mass in the left shoulder that could be a fibrotic change or a lipoma. did you feel any discomfort during the procedure?
[patient] no, i did not feel anything.
[doctor] that's great. there was some bleeding during the biopsy and resulted in a localized hematoma, but we were able to manage it with pressure and ice packing. you were monitored for about 30 minutes after the biopsy, and we discharged you in good condition. we will wait for the pathology report to come back before deciding on the next steps. we classified the mammogram findings as birads 4, which means suspicious findings. we need to keep a close eye on this and may require further testing. do you have any questions or concerns?
[patient] no, not at the moment.","[doctor] alright. um, just to make sure, you understand all of this information, right?

"CC:
Orthostatic lightheadedness.
HX:
This 76 y/o male complained of several months of generalized weakness and malaise, and a two week history of progressively worsening orthostatic dizziness. The dizziness worsened when moving into upright positions. In addition, he complained of intermittent throbbing holocranial headaches, which did not worsen with positional change, for the past several weeks. He had lost 40 pounds over the past year and denied any recent fever, SOB, cough, vomiting, diarrhea, hemoptysis, melena, hematochezia, bright red blood per rectum, polyuria, night sweats, visual changes, or syncopal episodes.
He had a 100+ pack-year history of tobacco use and continued to smoke 1 to 2 packs per day. He has a history of sinusitis.

The patient was initially hydrated with IV normal saline and his orthostatic hypotension resolved, but returned within 24-48hrs. Further laboratory studies revealed: Aldosterone (serum)<2ng/DL (low), 30 minute Cortrosyn Stimulation test: pre 6.9ug/DL (borderline low), post 18.5ug/DL (normal stimulation rise), Prolactin 15.5ng/ML (no baseline given), FSH and LH were within normal limits for males. Testosterone 33ng/DL (wnl). Sinus XR series (done for history of headache) showed an abnormal sellar region with enlarged sella tursica and destruction of the posterior clinoids. There was also an abnormal calcification seen in the middle of the sellar region. A left maxillary sinus opacity with air-fluid level was seen. Goldman visual field testing was unremarkable. Brain CT and MRI revealed suprasellar mass most consistent with pituitary adenoma. He was treated with Fludrocortisone 0.05 mg BID and within 24hrs, despite discontinuation of IV fluids, remained hemodynamically stable and free of symptoms of orthostatic hypotension. His presumed pituitary adenoma continues to be managed with Fludrocortisone as of this writing (1/1997), though he has developed dementia felt secondary to cerebrovascular disease (stroke/TIA).","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?

Memory difficulty.
HX:
This 64 y/o RHM had had difficulty remembering names, phone numbers and events for 12 months prior to presentation, on 2/28/95. This had been called to his attention by the clerical staff at his parish--he was a Catholic priest. He had had no professional or social faux pas or mishaps due to his memory. He could not tell whether his problem was becoming worse, so he brought himself to the Neurology clinic on his own referral.
MEDS:
None.

1)appendectomy, 2)tonsillectomy, 3)childhood pneumonia, 4)allergy to sulfa drugs.
FHX:
Both parents experienced memory problems in their ninth decades, but not earlier. 5 siblings have had no memory trouble. There are no neurological illnesses in his family.
SHX:
Catholic priest. Denied Tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use.
EXAM:
BP131/74, HR78, RR12, 36.9C, Wt. 77kg, Ht. 178cm.
MS: A&O to person, place and time. 29/30 on MMSE; 2/3 recall at 5 minutes. 2/10 word recall at 10 minutes. Unable to remember the name of the President (Clinton). 23words/60 sec on Category fluency testing (normal). Mild visual constructive deficit.
The rest of the neurologic exam was unremarkable and there were no extrapyramidal signs or primitive reflexes noted.
COURSE:
TSH 5.1, T4 7.9, RPR non-reactive. Neuropsychological evaluation, 3/6/95, revealed: 1)well preserved intellectual functioning and orientation, 2) significant deficits in verbal and visual memory, proper naming, category fluency and working memory, 3)performances which were below expectations on tests of speed of reading, visual scanning, visual construction and clock drawing, 4)limited insight into the scope and magnitude of cognitive dysfunction. The findings indicated multiple areas of cerebral dysfunction. With the exception of the patient's report of minimal occupational dysfunction ( which may reflect poor insight), the clinical picture is consistent with a progressive dementia syndrome such as Alzheimer's disease. MRI brain, 3/6/95, showed mild generalized atrophy, more severe in the occipital-parietal regions.
In 4/96, his performance on repeat neuropsychological evaluation was relatively stable. His verbal learning and delayed recognition were within normal limits, whereas delayed recall was ""moderately severely"" impaired. Immediate and delayed visual memory were slightly below expectations. Temporal orientation and expressive language skills were below expectation, especially in word retrieval. These findings were suggestive of particular, but not exclusive, involvement of the temporal lobes.
On 9/30/96, he was evaluated for a 5 minute spell of visual loss, OU. The episode occurred on Friday, 9/27/96, in the morning while sitting at his desk doing paperwork. He suddenly felt that his gaze was pulled toward a pile of letters; then a ""curtain"" came down over both visual fields, like ""everything was in the shade."" During the episode he felt fully alert and aware of his surroundings. He concurrently heard a ""grating sound"" in his head. After the episode, he made several phone calls, during which he reportedly sounded confused, and perseverated about opening a bank account. He then drove to visit his sister in Muscatine, Iowa, without accident. He was reportedly ""normal"" when he reached her house. He was able to perform Mass over the weekend without any difficulty. Neurologic examination, 9/30/96, was notable for: 1)category fluency score of 18items/60 sec. 2)VFFTC and EOM were intact. There was no RAPD, INO, loss of visual acuity. Glucose 178 (elevated), ESR
Lipid profile, GS, CBC with differential, Carotid duplex scan, EKG, and EEG were all normal. MRI brain, 9/30/96, was unchanged from previous, 3/6/95.
On 1/3/97, he had a 30 second spell of lightheadedness without vertigo, but with balance difficulty, after picking up a box of books. The episode was felt due to orthostatic changes.
1/8/97 neuropsychological evaluation was stable and his MMSE score was 25/30 (with deficits in visual construction, orientation, and 2/3 recall at 1 minute). Category fluency score 23 items/60 sec. Neurologic exam was notable for graphesthesia in the left hand.
In 2/97, he had episodes of anxiety, marked fluctuations in job performance and resigned his pastoral position. His neurologic exam was unchanged. An FDG-PET scan on 2/14/97 revealed decreased uptake in the right posterior temporal-parietal and lateral occipital regions.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm not doing so well. i've been having difficulty remembering things lately.

[patient] no, i don't take any medications and my medical history only includes an appendectomy, tonsillectomy, childhood pneumonia, and an allergy to sulfa drugs.
[doctor] okay, let's do a physical exam. your vital signs look good. on your neurological exam, you scored 29 out of 30 on the mmse and had mild visual constructive deficit. we'll need to do some more testing to figure out what's going on. your mri shows mild generalized atrophy with more severe atrophy in the occipital-parietal regions, which is consistent with a progressive dementia syndrome like alzheimer's disease. we'll also need to do some neuropsychological evaluations to get a better idea of your cognitive function.
[patient] okay, i understand.
[doctor] unfortunately, your neuropsychological evaluation revealed significant deficits in verbal and visual memory, proper naming, category fluency, and working memory. you also had performances that were below expectations on tests of speed of reading, visual scanning, visual construction, and clock drawing. your limited insight into the scope and magnitude of cognitive dysfunction suggests multiple areas of cerebral dysfunction.

"CC:
Seizures.
HX:
The patient was initially evaluated at UIHC at 7 years of age. He had been well until 7 months prior to evaluation when he started having spells which were described as ""dizzy spells"" lasting from several seconds to one minute in duration. They occurred quite infrequently and he was able to resume activity immediately following the episodes. The spell became more frequent and prolonged, and by the time of initial evaluation were occurring 2-3 times per day and lasting 2-3 minutes in duration. In addition, in the 3 months prior to evaluation, the right upper extremity would become tonic and flexed during the episodes, and he began to experience post ictal fatigue.
BIRTH HX:
32 weeks gestation to a G4 mother and weighed 4#11oz. He was placed in an incubator for 3 weeks. He was jaundiced, but there was no report that he required treatment.
PMH:
Single febrile convulsion lasting ""3 hours"" at age 2 years.
MEDS:
none.
EXAM:
Appears healthy and in no acute distress. Unremarkable general and neurologic exam.
Impression: Psychomotor seizures.
Studies: Skull X-Rays were unremarkable.
EEG showed ""minimal spike activity during hyperventilation, as well as random sharp delta activity over the left temporal area, in drowsiness and sleep. This record also showed moderate amplitude asymmetry ( left greater than right) over the frontal central and temporal areas, which is a peculiar finding."",COURSE:
The patient was initially treated with Phenobarbital; then Dilantin was added (early 1970's); then Depakene was added ( early 1980's) due to poor seizure control. An EEG on 8/22/66 showed ""Left mid-temporal spike focus with surrounding slow abnormality, especially posterior to the anterior temporal areas (sparing the parasagittal region). In addition, the right lateral anterior hemisphere voltage is relatively depressed. ...this suggests two separate areas of cerebral pathology."" He underwent his first HCT scan in Sioux City in 1981, and this revealed an right temporal arachnoid cyst. The patient had behavioral problems throughout elementary/junior high/high school. He underwent several neurosurgical evaluations at UIHC and Mayo Clinic and was told that surgery was unwarranted. He was placed on numerous antiepileptic medication combinations including Tegretol, Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Depakote, Acetazolamide, and Mysoline. Despite this he averaged 2-3 spells a month. He was last seen, 6/19/95, and was taking Dilantin and Tegretol. His typical spells were described as sudden in onset and without aura. He frequently becomes tonic or undergoes tonic-clonic movement and falls with associated loss of consciousness. He usually has rapid recovery and can return to work in 20 minutes. He works at a Turkey packing plant. Serial HCT scans showed growth in the arachnoid cyst until 1991, when growth arrest appeared to have occurred.","[doctor] hello, how can i help you today?

Episodic confusion.
HX:
This 65 y/o RHM reportedly suffered a stroke on 1/17/92. He presented locally at that time with complaint of episodic confusion and memory loss lasting several minutes per episode. The ""stroke"" was reportedly verified on MRI scan dated 1/17/92. He was subsequently placed on ASA and DPH. He admitted that there had been short periods (1-2 days duration) since then, during which he had forgotten to take his DPH. However, even when he had been taking his DPH regularly, he continued to experience the spells mentioned above. He denied any associated tonic/clonic movement, incontinence, tongue-biting, HA, visual change, SOB, palpitation, weakness or numbness. The episodes of confusion and memory loss last 1-2 minutes in duration, and have been occurring 2-3 times per week.

"REFERRAL QUESTIONS:
Mr. Abcd was referred for psychological assessment by his primary medical provider, to help clarify his diagnosis, especially with respect to Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, a depression, or a Bipolar Spectrum Disorder.  The information will be used for treatment planning.
BACKGROUND INFORMATION:
Mr. Abcd is a 33-year-old married man who lives with his wife and three children.  He has been married since 1995 and lost a son to SIDS over seven years ago.  He served in the army for two years, and did attend some college at UAA.  He still wants to get a degree in engineering.  Mr. Abcd indicated that he did use THC at the time of his initial intake with me in January 2006, but there are no other substance abuse issues as an adult so far as I am aware.  He has had multiple stressors, including a bankruptcy in 2000, as well as his wife's significant health problems.  He also reported having herniated discs incurred in an injury over a year ago.  He has received counseling in the past, and did try both Lexapro and Wellbutrin, which he stopped taking in October 2005.  He indicated these medications tended to decrease libido and flatten all of his emotions.  He indicated that he thought he might have Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, but that this had not been formally evaluated or treated.  There is no reported bipolar illness in his immediate family, but there is some depression.  A recent stressor involved OCS involvement, apparently because his infant child tested positive for THC.  So far as I am aware, this case is closed at this time.
BEHAVIORAL OBSERVATIONS:
Mr. Abcd arrived on time for his testing session dressed casually and with good hygiene and grooming.  Mood is reported to be generally okay, though with some stress.  Affect was bright and appropriate to the situation.  Speech was a little pressured, but was of normal content and was at all times coherent and goal directed.  He was a very pleasant and cooperative testing subject, who appeared to give a good effort on the tasks requested of him.  The results appear to provide a useful sample of his current attitudes, opinions, and functional levels in the areas assessed.
ASSESSMENT RESULTS:
Mr. Abcd's responses to a brief self-report instrument given to him by Dr. Starks was suggestive of symptoms that could be consistent with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.  I therefore had him complete the Conners CPT-II, which showed good performance and no indications of attention problems.  The Confidence Index associated with ADHD was over 58 percent that no clinical attention problems are present.  While a diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder should not unequivocally be ruled out based on the results of this test, there is nothing in the CPT-II measures indicating attention problems, and that diagnosis appears to be unlikely.  The MMPI-2 profile is a technically valid and interpretable one.  The Modified Welsh Code is as follows:  49+86-231/570:  F'+-/:LK#.  The high F scale may reflect some moodiness, restlessness, dissatisfaction, and changeableness in his typical behavior.  The Basic Clinical Profile is similar to persons who tend to get into trouble for violating social norms and rules.  Such persons are more likely to experience conflicts with authority.  They also are prone to impulsivity, self-indulgence, problems with delay of gratification, exercise problematic judgment, and often have low frustration tolerance.  Those with similar scores tend to be moody, irritable, extraverted, and often do not trust others very much.  Mr. Abcd may tend to keep others at a distance, yet feel rather insecure and dependent.  A bipolar diagnosis is a possibility, and an antisocial personality disorder cannot be entirely ruled out either, though I am less confident that that is correct.  The MMPI-2 Content Scale scores indicate some mild depression and family stressors, and the Supplementary Scales has a single clinical elevation on Addiction Admission, which is entirely consistent with his interview data.  Posttraumatic stress scales are not elevated at a clear clinical level on the MMPI-2.
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS:
","[doctor] hi there, mr. abcd. how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, i'm doing okay.
[doctor] i wanted to go over the results of your psychological assessment with you. based on your responses to the self-report instrument, it's possible that you may have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. however, when we did the conners cpt-ii, there were no indications of attention problems, so it's unlikely that you have adhd.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] your mmpi-2 profile is technically valid and interpretable. the modified welsh code suggests that you may be moody, irritable, and have difficulty trusting others. you may tend to keep others at a distance, but still feel insecure and dependent. a bipolar diagnosis is a possibility, and there's a chance that you may have an antisocial personality disorder, although i'm less confident in that diagnosis. your mmpi-2 content scale scores indicate some mild depression and family stressors, and there's a single clinical elevation on addiction admission, which is consistent with what you told me during your interview.
[patient] okay, what does all of that mean?
[doctor] it means that we need to take a closer look at your symptoms and figure out the best way to treat them. i'd like to refer you to a psychiatrist who can evaluate you for bipolar disorder and other mood disorders. we can also refer you to a therapist who can help you work through any depression or family stressors that you're experiencing. additionally, we can explore other treatment options besides medication, such as cognitive behavioral therapy.
[patient] okay, that sounds like a good plan.

"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. ABC is a 60-year-old gentleman who had a markedly abnormal stress test earlier today in my office with severe chest pain after 5 minutes of exercise on the standard Bruce with horizontal ST depressions and moderate apical ischemia on stress imaging only.  He required 3 sublingual nitroglycerin in total (please see also admission history and physical for full details).
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization with myself today which showed mild-to-moderate left main distal disease of 30%, moderate proximal LAD with a severe mid-LAD lesion of 99%, and a mid-left circumflex lesion of 80% with normal LV function and some mild luminal irregularities in the right coronary artery with some moderate stenosis seen in the mid to distal right PDA.
I discussed these results with the patient, and he had been relating to me that he was having rest anginal symptoms, as well as nocturnal anginal symptoms, and especially given the severity of the mid left anterior descending lesion, with a markedly abnormal stress test, I felt he was best suited for transfer for PCI.  I discussed the case with Dr. X at Medical Center who has kindly accepted the patient in transfer.
CONDITION ON TRANSFER:
Stable but guarded.  The patient is pain-free at this time.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg once a day.
2.  Metoprolol 50 mg once a day, but we have had to hold it because of relative bradycardia which he apparently has a history of.
3.  Nexium 40 mg once a day.
4.  Zocor 40 mg once a day, and there is a fasting lipid profile pending at the time of this dictation.  I see that his LDL was 136 on May 3, 2002.
5.  Plavix 600 mg p.o. x1 which I am giving him tonight.
Other medical history is inclusive for obstructive sleep apnea for which he is unable to tolerate positive pressure ventilation, GERD, arthritis,DISPOSITION:
The patient and his wife have requested and are agreeable with transfer to Medical Center, and we are enclosing the CD ROM of his images.","[doctor] hi mr. abc, i'm dr. x from medical center. how are you feeling today?
[patient] hi, dr. x. i'm feeling okay, a little guarded, but no pain at the moment.
[doctor] i understand that you had a markedly abnormal stress test earlier today with severe chest pain after just 5 minutes of exercise. is that correct?
[patient] yes, that's right.
[doctor] after undergoing cardiac catheterization, it was discovered that you have mild-to-moderate left main distal disease of 30%, moderate proximal lad with a severe mid-lad lesion of 99%, and a mid-left circumflex lesion of 80%. given the severity of your mid-left anterior descending lesion and the abnormal stress test, we think it would be best for you to undergo pci. do you have any questions about the procedure?
[patient] no, i don't think so. i trust your judgement.
[doctor] great. before we proceed, i just want to confirm your current medications. you're taking aspirin, nexium, and zocor, correct?

GC and chlamydia cultures as well as a repeat Pap smear were done.
Colposcopy is then performed without and with acetic acid.  This shows an entirely normal transformation zone, so no biopsies are taken.  An endocervical curettage is then performed with Cytobrush and curette and sent to pathology.  Colposcopy of the vulva is then performed again with acetic acid.

"She started her periods at age 13.  She is complaining of a three-month history of lower abdominal pain for which she has been to the emergency room twice.  She describes the pain as bilateral, intermittent, and non-radiating.  It decreases slightly when she eats and increases with activity.  She states the pain when it comes can last for half-a-day.  It is not associated with movement, but occasionally the pain was so bad that it was associated with vomiting.  She has tried LactAid, which initially helped, but then the pain returned.  She has tried changing her diet and Pepcid AC.  She was seen at XYZ where blood work was done.  At that time, she had a normal white count and a normal H&H.  She was given muscle relaxants, which did not work.
Approximately two weeks ago, she was seen in the emergency room at XYZ where a pelvic ultrasound was done.  This showed a 1.9 x 1.4-cm cyst on the right with no free fluid.  The left ovary and uterus appeared normal.  Two days later, the pain resolved and she has not had a recurrence.  She denies constipation and diarrhea.  She has had some hot flashes, but has not taken her temperature.
In addition, she states that her periods have been very irregular coming between four and six weeks.  They are associated with cramping which she is not happy about.
She has never had a pelvic exam.  She states she is not sexually active and declined having her mother leave the room, so she was not questioned regarding this without her mother present.  She is very interested in not having pain with her periods and if this was a cyst that caused her pain, she is interested in starting birth control pills to prevent this from happening again.

A/P:
Abdominal pain, unclear etiology.  I expressed my doubt that her pain was secondary to this 1.9-cm ovarian cyst given the fact that there was no free fluid surrounding this.  However, given that she has irregular periods and they are painful for her, I think it is reasonable to start her on a low-dose birth control pill.  She has no personal or familial contraindications to start this.  She was given a prescription for Lo/Ovral, dispensed 30 with refill x 4.  She will come back in six weeks for blood pressure check as well as in six months to followup on her pain and her bleeding patterns.
If she should have the recurrence of her pain, I have advised her to call.","[doctor]: hello, how are you feeling today?

"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is the case of a 31-year-old white female admitted to the hospital with pelvic pain and vaginal bleeding.  The patient had a positive hCG with a negative sonogram and hCG titer of about 18,000.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was admitted to the hospital with the diagnosis of a possible incomplete abortion, to rule out ectopic pregnancy or rupture of corpus luteal cyst.  The patient was kept in observation for 24 hours.  The sonogram stated there was no gestational sac, but there was a small mass within the uterus that could represent a gestational sac.  The patient was admitted to the hospital.  A repeat hCG titer done on the same day came back as 15,000, but then the following day, it came back as 18,000.  The diagnosis of a possible ruptured ectopic pregnancy was established.  The patient was taken to surgery and a laparotomy was performed with findings of a right ruptured ectopic pregnancy.  The right salpingectomy was performed with no complications.  The patient received 2 units of red packed cells.  On admission, her hemoglobin was 12.9, then in the afternoon it dropped to 8.1, and the following morning, it was 7.9.  Again, based on these findings, the severe abdominal pain, we made the diagnosis of ectopic and it was proved or confirmed at surgery.  The hospital course was uneventful.  There was no fever reported.  The abdomen was soft.  She had a normal bowel movement.  The patient was dismissed on 09/09/2007 to be followed in my office in 4 days.
FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Right ruptured ectopic pregnancy with hemoperitoneum.
2.  Anemia secondary to blood loss.
PLAN:
The patient will be dismissed on pain medication and iron therapy.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?

"CC:
RLE weakness.
HX:
This 42y/o RHM was found 2/27/95 slumped over the steering wheel of the Fed Ex truck he was driving. He was cyanotic and pulseless according to witnesses. EMT evaluation revealed him to be in ventricular fibrillation and he was given epinephrine, lidocaine, bretylium and electrically defibrillated and intubated in the field. Upon arrival at a local ER his cardiac rhythm deteriorated and he required more than 9 counter shocks (defibrillation) at 360 joules per shock, epinephrine and lidocaine. This had no effect. He was then given intracardiac epinephrine and a subsequent electrical defibrillation placed him in atrial fibrillation. He was then taken emergently to cardiac catherization and was found to have normal coronary arteries. He was then admitted to an intensive care unit and required intraortic balloon pump pressure support via the right gorin. His blood pressure gradually improved and his balloon pump was discontinued on 5/5/95. Recovery was complicated by acute renal failure and liver failure. Initail CK=13,780, the CKMB fraction was normal at 0.8.

MRI Pelvis, 3/28/95, revealed increased T1 weighted signal within the right iliopsoas suggestive of hematoma. An intra-osseous lipoma was incidentally notice in the right sacrum. Neuropsychologic assessment showed moderately compromised anterograde verbal memory, and temporal orientation and retrograde recall were below expectations. These findings were consistent with mesial temporal dysfunction secondary to anoxic injury and were mild in lieu of his history. He underwent implantation of a Medtronic internal cardiac difibrillator. His cardiac electrophysiology study found no inducible ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. He suffered mild to moderate permanent RLE weakness, especially involving the quadriceps. His femoral nerve compression had been present to long to warrant decompression. EMG/NCV studies revealed severe axonal degeneration.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] not too good, doctor. i have been experiencing weakness in my right leg.
[doctor] i understand. let me go through your medical history and see if there is anything that might be related. so, i see here that you had a cardiac event back in 1995 and were given a variety of medications, am i correct?
[patient] yes, that's correct.
[doctor] alright, and have you been taking all of your medications as prescribed?

Tumor extension is also suggested in the anterior limb of the interanl capsule on the right. There is midline mass shift to the left with effacement of the anterior horn of the right lateral ventricle. The MRI findings are most consistent with glioblastoma.
The patient underwent right frontal lobectomy. The pathological diagnosis was xanthomatous astrocytoma. The literature at the time was not clear as to optimal treatment protocol. People have survived as long as 25 years after diagnosis with this type of tumor. XRT was deferred until 11/91 when an MRI and PET Scan suggested extension of the tumor. She then received 5580 cGy of XRT in divided segments. She developed olfactory auras shortly after lobectomy at was treated with PB with subsequent improvement. She was treated with BCNU chemotherapy protocol in 1992.","[doctor]: hi there, how can i help you today?

This 73 y/o RHF presented on 1/12/95, with progressive memory and cognitive decline since 11/94.
Her difficulties were first noted by family the week prior to Thanksgiving, when they were taking her to Vail, Colorado to play ""Murder She Wrote"" at family gathering. Unbeknownst to the patient was the fact that she had been chosen to be the ""assassin."" Prior to boarding the airplane her children hid a toy gun in her carry-on luggage. As the patient walked through security the alarm went off and within seconds she was surrounded, searched and interrogated. She and her family eventually made their flight, but she seemed unusually flustered and disoriented by the event. In prior times they would have expected her to have brushed off the incident with a ""chuckle."",While in Colorado her mentation seemed slow and she had difficulty reading the lines to her part while playing ""Murder She Wrote."" She needed assistance to complete the game. The family noted no slurring of speech, difficulty with vision, or focal weakness at the time.
She returned to work at a local florist shop the Monday following Thanksgiving, and by her own report, had difficulty carrying out her usual tasks of flower arranging and operating the cash register. She quit working the next day and never went back.
Her mental status appeared to remain relatively stable throughout the month of November and December and during that time she was evaluated by a local neurologist. Serum VDRL, TFTs, GS, B12, Folate, CBC, CXR, and MRI of the Brain were all reportedly unremarkable. The working diagnosis was ""Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type."",One to two weeks prior to her 1/12/95 presentation, she became repeatedly lost in her own home. In addition, she, and especially her family, noticed increased difficulty with word finding, attention, and calculation. Furthermore, she began expressing emotional lability unusual for her. She also tended to veer toward the right when walking and often did not recognize the location of people talking to her.
MEDS:
None.
PMH:
Unremarkable.
FHX:
Father and mother died in their 80's of ""old age."" There was no history of dementing illness, stroke, HTN, DM, or other neurological disease in her family. She has 5 children who were alive and well.
SHX:
She attained a High School education and had been widowed for over 30 years. She lived alone for 15 years until to 12/94, when her daughters began sharing the task of caring for her. She had no history of tobacco, alcohol or illicit drug use.
EXAM:
Vitals signs were within normal limits.
MS: A&O to person place and time. At times she seemed in absence. She scored 20/30 on MMSE and had difficulty with concentration, calculation, visuospatial construction. Her penmanship was not normal, and appeared ""child-like"" according to her daughters. She had difficulty writing a sentence and spoke in a halting fashion; she appeared to have difficulty finding words. In addition, while attempting to write, she had difficulty finding the right margin of the page.
CN: Right homonymous inferior quadrantanopsia bordering on a right homonymous hemianopsia. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable.
Motor: 5/5 strength throughout with normal muscle tone and bulk.
Sensory: extinguishing of RUE sensation on double simultaneous stimulation, and at times she appeared to show sign of RUE neglect. There were no unusual spontaneous movements noted.
Coord: unremarkable except for difficulty finding the target on FNF exercise when the target was moved into the right side visual field.
Station: No sign of Romberg or pronator drift. There was no truncal ataxia.
Gait: decreased RUE swing and a tendency to veer and circumambulate to the right when asked to walk toward a target.
Reflexes: 2/2 and symmetric throughout all four extremities. Plantar responses were equivocal, bilaterally.
COURSE:
CBC, GS, PT, PTT, ESR, UA, CRP, TSH, FT4, and EKG were unremarkable. CSF analysis revealed: 38 RBC, 0 WBC, Protein 36, glucose 76. The outside MRI was reviewed and was found to show increased signal on T2 weighted images in the gyri of the left parietal-occipital regions. Repeat MRI, at UIHC, revealed the same plus increased signal on T2 weighted images in the left frontal region as well. CXR, transthoracic echocardiogram and 4 vessel cerebral angiogram were unremarkable. A 1/23/95, left frontal brain biopsy revealed spongiform changes without sign of focal necrosis, vasculitis or inflammatory changes. The working diagnosis became Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (Heidenhaim variant). The patient died on 2/15/95. Brain tissue was sent to the University of California at San Francisco. Analysis there revealed diffuse vacuolization throughout most of the cingulate gyrus, frontal cortex, hypothalamus, globus pallidus, putamen, insula, amygdala, hippocampus, cerebellum and medulla. This vacuolization was most severe in the entorhinal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus. Hydrolytic autoclaving technique was used with PrP-specific antibodies to identify the presence of protease resistant PrP (CJD). The patient's brain tissue was strongly positive for PrP (CJD).","[doctor] hello, can you tell me your name?

"ADMITTING DIAGNOSES:
1.  Leiomyosarcoma.
2.  History of pulmonary embolism.
3.  History of subdural hematoma.
4.  Pancytopenia.
5.  History of pneumonia.
PROCEDURES DURING HOSPITALIZATION:
1.  Cycle six of CIVI-CAD (Cytoxan, Adriamycin, and DTIC) from 07/22/2008 to 07/29/2008.
2.  CTA, chest PE study showing no evidence for pulmonary embolism.
3.  Head CT showing no evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
4.  Sinus CT, normal mini-CT of the paranasal sinuses.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Ms. ABC is a pleasant 66-year-old Caucasian female who first palpated a mass in the left posterior arm in spring of 2007.  The mass increased in size and she was seen by her primary care physician and referred to orthopedic surgeon.  MRI showed inflammation and was thought to be secondary to rheumatoid arthritis.  The mass increased in size.  She eventually underwent a partial resection found to have pathologic grade 2 leiomyosarcoma, margins were impossible to assess, but were likely positive.  She was evaluated by Dr. X and Dr. Y and a decision was made to proceed with preoperative chemotherapy.  She began treatment with CIVI-CAD in December 2007.  Her course was complicated by pulmonary embolus, pneumonia, and subdural hematoma while on anticoagulation.  She eventually underwent surgical resection on May 1, 2008 with small area of residual disease, but otherwise clear margins.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Leiomyosarcoma, the patient was admitted to Hem/Onco B Service under attending Dr. XYZ for cycle six of continuous IV infusion Cytoxan, Adriamycin, and DTIC, which she tolerated well.
2.  History of pulmonary embolism.  Upon admission, the patient reported an approximate two-week history of dyspnea on exertion and some mild chest pain.  She underwent a CTA, which showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism and the patient was started on prophylactic doses of Lovenox at 40 mg a day.  She had no further complaints throughout the hospitalization with any shortness of breath or chest pain.
3.  History of subdural hematoma, also on admission the patient noted some mild intermittent headaches that were fleeting in nature, several a day that would resolve on their own.  Her headaches were not responding to pain medication and so on 07/24/2008, we obtained a head CT that showed no evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.  The patient also had a history of sinusitis and so a sinus CT scan was obtained, which was normal.
4.  Pancytopenia.  On admission, the patient's white blood count was 3.4, hemoglobin 11.3, platelet count 82, and ANC of 2400.  The patient's counts were followed throughout admission.  She did not require transfusion of red blood cells or platelets; however, on 07/26/2008 her ANC did dip to 900 and she was placed on neutropenic diet.  At discharge her ANC is back up to 1100 and she is taken off neutropenic diet.  Her white blood cell count at discharge was 1.4 and her hemoglobin was 11.2 with a platelet count of 140.
5.  History of pneumonia.  During admission, the patient did not exhibit any signs or symptoms of pneumonia.
DISPOSITION:
Home in stable condition.
DIET:
Regular and less neutropenic.
ACTIVITY:
Resume same activity.
FOLLOWUP:

"REASON FOR ADMISSION:
Fever of unknown origin.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 39-year-old woman with polymyositis/dermatomyositis on methotrexate once a week.  The patient has also been on high-dose prednisone for an urticarial rash.  The patient was admitted because of persistent high fevers without a clear-cut source of infection.  She had been having temperatures of up to 103 for 8-10 days.  She had been seen at Alta View Emergency Department a week prior to admission.  A workup there including chest x-ray, blood cultures, and a transthoracic echocardiogram had all remained nondiagnostic, and were normal.  Her chest x-ray on that occasion was normal.  After the patient was seen in the office on August 10, she persisted with high fevers and was admitted on August 11 to Cottonwood Hospital.  Studies done at Cottonwood:  CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  Results:  CT chest showed mild bibasilar pleural-based interstitial changes.  These were localized to mid and lower lung zones.  The process was not diffuse.  There was no ground glass change.  CT abdomen and pelvis was normal.  Infectious disease consultation was obtained.  Dr. XYZ saw the patient.  He ordered serologies for CMV including a CMV blood PCR.  Next serologies for EBV, Legionella, Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, Coccidioides, and cryptococcal antigen, and a PPD.  The CMV serology came back positive for IgM.  The IgG was negative.  The CMV blood PCR was positive, as well.  Other serologies and her PPD stayed negative.  Blood cultures stayed negative.
In view of the positive CMV, PCR, and the changes in her CAT scan, the patient was taken for a bronchoscopy.  BAL and transbronchial biopsies were performed.  The transbronchial biopsies did not show any evidence of pneumocystis, fungal infection, AFB.  There was some nonspecific interstitial fibrosis, which was minimal.  I spoke with the pathologist, Dr. XYZ and immunopathology was done to look for CMV.  The patient had 3 nucleoli on the biopsy specimens that stained positive and were consistent with CMV infection.  The patient was started on ganciclovir once her CMV serologies had come back positive.  No other antibiotic therapy was prescribed.  Next, the patient's methotrexate was held.
A chest x-ray prior to discharge showed some bibasilar disease, showing interstitial infiltrates.  The patient was given ibuprofen and acetaminophen during her hospitalization, and her fever resolved with these measures.
On the BAL fluid cell count, the patient only had 5 WBCs and 5 RBCs on the differential.  It showed 43% neutrophils, 45% lymphocytes.
Discussions were held with Dr. XYZ, Dr. XYZ, her rheumatologist, and with pathology.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Disseminated CMV infection with possible CMV pneumonitis.
2.  Polymyositis on immunosuppressive therapy (methotrexate and prednisone).
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  The patient is going to go on ganciclovir 275 mg IV q.12 h. for approximately 3 weeks.

1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure.
2. Chronic atrial fibrillation with prior ablation done on Coumadin treatment.
3. Mitral stenosis.
4. Remote history of lung cancer with prior resection of the left upper lobe.
5. Anxiety and depression.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Details are present in the dictated report.
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient is a 71-year-old lady who came in with increased shortness of breath of one day duration. She denied history of chest pain or fevers or cough with purulent sputum at that time. She was empirically treated with a course of antibiotics of Avelox for ten days. She also received steroids, prednisolone 60 mg, and breathing treatments with albuterol, Ipratropium and her bronchodilator therapy was also optimized with theophylline. She continued to receive Coumadin for her chronic atrial fibrillation. Her heart rate was controlled and was maintained in the 60s-70s. On the third day of admission she developed worsening respiratory failure with fatigue, and hence was required to be intubated and ventilated. She was put on mechanical ventilation from 1/29 to 2/6/06. She was extubated on 2/6 and put on BI-PAP. The pressures were gradually increased from 10 and 5 to 15 of BI-PAP and 5 of E-PAP with FIO2 of 35% at the time of transfer to Kindred. Her bronchospasm also responded to the aggressive bronchodilation and steroid therapy.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Prednisolone 60 mg orally once daily, albuterol 2.5 mg nebulized every 4 hours, Atrovent Respules to be nebulized every 6 hours, Pulmicort 500 micrograms nebulized twice every 8 hours, Coumadin 5 mg orally once daily, magnesium oxide 200 mg orally once daily.
TRANSFER INSTRUCTIONS:
The patient is to be strictly kept on bi-level PAP of 15 I-PAP/E-PAP of 5 cm and FIO2 of 35% for most of the times during the day. She may be put on nasal cannula 2 to 3 liters per minute with an O2 saturation of 90-92% at meal times only, and that is to be limited to 1-2 hours every meal. On admission her potassium had risen slightly to 5.5, and hence her ACE inhibitor had to be discontinued. We may restart it again at a later date once her blood pressure control is better if required.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i am feeling better, thank you.
[doctor] that's great. so, i wanted to go over your discharge diagnoses with you. you have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, chronic atrial fibrillation with prior ablation done on coumadin treatment, mitral stenosis, remote history of lung cancer with prior resection of the left upper lobe, and anxiety and depression. do you have any questions about these diagnoses?
[patient] no, i think i understand them.
[doctor] okay, great. during your hospital stay, we treated you with antibiotics, steroids, and breathing treatments to help with your shortness of breath. we also optimized your bronchodilator therapy and continued your coumadin for your atrial fibrillation. unfortunately, on the third day of your admission, you developed worsening respiratory failure and had to be intubated and ventilated. however, you responded well to the aggressive bronchodilation and steroid therapy, and you were extubated on february 6th and put on bi-level positive airway pressure (bi-pap). 
[patient] yes, i remember that.
[doctor] good. you will need to continue using the bi-pap machine at home with a pressure of 15 i-pap/e-pap of 5 cm and fio2 of 35% for most of the day. you can use a nasal cannula with 2 to 3 liters of oxygen per minute for 1-2 hours during meal times only to maintain an oxygen saturation of 90-92%. we also need to limit your ace inhibitor for now due to your slightly elevated potassium level, but we may restart it at a later date if needed.

"FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Gastroenteritis.
2.  Autism.
DIET ON DISCHARGE:
Regular for age.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
Adderall and clonidine for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
ACTIVITY ON DISCHARGE:
As tolerated.
DISPOSITION ON DISCHARGE:
Follow up with Dr. X in ABC Office in 1 to 2 weeks.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This 10-and-4/12-year-old Caucasian female has autism and is enrolled at ABC School, and she takes Adderall and clonidine for her hyperactivity.  She developed constipation one week prior to admission and mother gave her MiraLax and her constipation improved.  She developed vomiting 3 days prior to admission, but did not have diarrhea.  She voided on the day of admission.  When she presented to the office, her weight was 124 pounds, which was approximately 10 pounds below previous weights and even had a weight of 151.5 pounds, 05/30/2007 and weight of 137.5 pounds, 09/11/2007 with mother giving no good explanation as to why she had lost all this weight.  She was admitted because of the persistent vomiting, but there was concern about the weight loss.
Physical examination on admission was unremarkable except for the obvious signs autistic spectrum disorder.
LABORATORY DATA:
Laboratory data included sedimentation rate of 12, magnesium level of 2.2, TSH of 2.63 with normal being 0.34 to 5.60, free T4 of 1.68 with normal being 0.58 to 1.64.  Chest x-ray and abdominal films were unremarkable.  Hemoglobin 14.5, hematocrit 43.5, platelet count 400,000, white blood count 11,800.  Urinalysis was negative for ketones.  Specific gravity 1.023, and negative for protein.  Sodium 137, potassium 3.4, chloride 103, CO2 20, BUN 21, creatinine 0.9, and anion gap 14, glucose 90, total protein 8.1, albumin 4.5, calcium 8.8, bilirubin 1.5, AST 26, ALT 16, alkaline phosphatase 118.  Thyroid peroxidase antibody studies are pending.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The child was observed on IV fluids and advanced to clear liquids and then regular diet as tolerated.  On the second hospital day, mother was comfortable taking her to home.  Mother did not have a good explanation for the weight loss.  In the hospital, her weight was 124 pounds, her height 58 inches, temperature 98.0 degree F.
pulse 123, respirations 18, blood pressure 148/94.  Follow up blood pressure were some of them were in the 125 to 70 range making us think her hypertension as labile and perhaps related to the excitement of the admission.
She seem quite happy and in no distress at the time of discharge.  We will follow up in the office and try to further evaluate her for the unexplained weight loss.  She has been taking the Adderall for at least a year, and the mother does not think the Adderall is the cause of the weight loss.  The free T4 is borderline high and probably bears repeating along with further studies for Graves disease as an outpatient.","[doctor] hi there. how are you feeling? 
[patient] i feel better now. 
[doctor] that's good to hear. the test results show that you had gastroenteritis. it's an infection in your stomach and intestines that caused your vomiting.

"ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:
Symptomatic cholelithiasis.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Symptomatic cholelithiasis.
SERVICE:
Surgery.
CONSULTS:
None.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Ms. ABC is a 27-year-old woman who apparently presented with complaint of symptomatic cholelithiasis.  She was afebrile.  She was taken by Dr. X to the operating room.
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient underwent a procedure.  She tolerated without difficulty.  She had her pain controlled with p.o. pain medicine.  She was afebrile.  She is tolerating liquid diet.  It was felt that the patient is stable for discharge.  She did complain of bladder spasms when she urinated and she did say that she has a history of chronic UTIs.  We will check a UA and urine culture prior to discharge.  I will give her prescription for ciprofloxacin that she can take for 3 days presumptively and I have discharged her home with omeprazole and Colace to take over-the-counter for constipation and we will send her home with Percocet for pain.  Her labs were within normal limits.  She did have an elevated white blood cell count, but I believe this is just leukemoid reaction, but she is afebrile, and if she does have UTI, may also be related.  Her labs in terms of her bilirubin were within normal limits.  Her LFTs were slightly elevated, I do believe this is related to the cautery used on the liver bed.  They were 51 and 83 for the AST and ALT respectively.  I feel that she looks good for discharge.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
Clear liquid diet x48 hours and she can return to her Medifast, she may shower.  She needs to keep her wound clean and dry.  She is not to engage in any heavy lifting greater than 10 pounds x2 weeks.  No driving for 1 to 2 weeks.  She must be able to stop in an emergency and be off narcotic meds, no strenuous activity, but she needs to maintain mobility.  She can resume her medications per med rec sheets.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
As previously mentioned.
FOLLOWUP:
We will follow up on both urinalysis and cultures.  She is instructed to follow up with Dr. X in 2 weeks.  She needs to call for any shortness of breath, temperature greater than 101.5, chest pain, intractable nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, any redness, swelling or foul smelling drainage from her wounds.","[doctor] hi ms. abc, how are you feeling today?

"HISTORY:
The patient is a 71-year-old female, who was referred for an outpatient modified barium swallow study to objectively evaluate her swallowing function and safety.  The patient complained of globus sensation high in her throat particularly with solid foods and with pills.  She denied history of coughing and chocking with meals.  The patient's complete medical history is unknown to me at this time.  The patient was cooperative and compliant throughout this evaluation.
STUDY:
Modified barium swallow study was performed in the Radiology Suite in cooperation with Dr. X. The patient was seated upright at a 90-degree angle in a video imaging chair.  To evaluate her swallowing function and safety, she was administered graduated amounts of food and liquid mixed with barium in the form of thin liquids (teaspoon x3. cup sip x4); thickened liquid (cup sip x3); puree consistency (teaspoon x3); and solid consistency (1/4 cracker x1).  The patient was given 2 additional cup sips of thin liquid following the puree and solid food presentation.
ORAL STAGE:
The patient had no difficulty with bolus control and transport.  No spillage out lips.  The patient appears to have pocketing __________ particularly with puree and solid food between her right faucial pillars.  The patient did state that she had her tonsil taken out as a child and appears to be a diverticulum located in this state.  Further evaluation by an ENT is highly recommended based on the residual and pooling that occurred during this evaluation.  We were not able to clear out the residual with alternating cup sips and thin liquid.
PHARYNGEAL STAGE:
No aspiration or penetration occurred during this evaluation.  The patient's hyolaryngeal elevation and anterior movements are within the functional limits.  Epiglottic inversion is within functional limits.  She had no residual or pooling in the pharynx after the swallow.
CERVICAL ESOPHAGEAL STAGE:
The patient's upper esophageal sphincter opening is well coordinated with swallow and readily accepted the bolus.
DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:
The patient had no aspiration or penetration occurred during this evaluation.  She does appear to have a diverticulum in the area between her right faucial pillars.  Additional evaluation is needed by an ENT physician.
PLAN:
Based on this evaluation, the following is recommended:
1.  The patient's diet should consist regular consistency food with thin liquids.  She needs to take small bites and small sips to help decrease her risk of aspiration and penetration as well as reflux.
2.  The patient should be referred to an otolaryngologist for further evaluation of her oral cavity particularly the area between her faucial pillars.
The above recommendations and results of the evaluation were discussed with the patient as well as her daughter and both responded appropriately.
Thank you for the opportunity to be required the patient's medical care.  She is not in need of skilled speech therapy and is discharged from my services.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?

[doctor] i see from your medical records that you were referred for a modified barium swallow study. can you tell me a little bit about why you were referred to this test?
[patient] yes, i was having a sensation of something stuck in my throat, especially when i eat solid foods and pills.
[doctor] i see. did you have any coughing or choking with meals?
[patient] no, i did not.
[doctor] alright, let me go over the results of your test. you had no difficulty with bolus control and transport, which is good. however, you do appear to have a diverticulum located in the area between your right faucial pillars. we were not able to clear out the residual with alternating cup sips and thin liquid. based on these results, i would like to refer you to an otolaryngologist for further evaluation of your oral cavity.

"HISTORY:
The patient is a 76-year-old male, with previous history of dysphagia, status post stroke.  The patient stated that he was at Hospital, secondary to his stroke, where he had his initial modified barium swallow study.  The patient stated that the results of that modified revealed aspiration with thin liquids only.  He is currently eating and drinking without difficulty and he feels that he can return to a regular diet with thin liquids.  A modified barium swallow study was ordered to objectively evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety and to rule out aspiration.
STUDY:
Modified barium swallow study was performed in the radiology suite in cooperation with Dr. X. The patient was seated upright and in a video-imaging chair throughout this assessment.
To evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety, he was administered graduated amounts of liquid and food mixed with barium in the form of thin liquids (teaspoon x3, cup sip x3); nectar-thick liquid (teaspoon x2, cup sip x3); pureed consistency (teaspoon x3); solid consistency (1/4 cracker x1).
FINDINGS,ORAL STAGE:
The patient had no spillage out lips.  Oral residual after swallow with increased viscosity requiring multiple swallows to clear oral cavity.
The patient has reduced lingual retraction contributing to vallecula pooling after the swallow.  Trace premature spillage was noted with thin liquids during this assessment.
PHARYNGEAL STAGE:
Aspiration noted on cup sips of thin liquid.  Trace-to-mild penetration with teaspoon amounts of thin liquid during and after the swallow.  The penetration after the swallow occurred secondary to spillage on the piriform sinuses into the laryngeal vestibule.  The patient has incomplete laryngeal closure, which allowed the aspiration and penetration with thin liquids.  The patient had no aspiration or penetration occur with nectar-thick liquid, puree, and solid food.  The patient has a mildly reduced hyolaryngeal elevation and anterior movement that leads to incomplete epiglottic inversion that contributes to vallecula pooling.  Mild-to-moderate pooling in the vallecula after the swallow with liquids and puree, this residual did decrease with the solid feed presentation.  The patient has mild residual of pooling in the piriform sinuses after a swallow that did clear with sequential swallows.
CERVICAL ESOPHAGEAL STAGE:
The patient's upper esophageal sphincter opening is well coordinated with swallow and readily accepted the bolus.
DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:
Mild aspiration with cup sips of thin liquid, penetration during and after the swallow with teaspoon amounts of thin liquid.  No aspiration or penetration occurred with thick liquid, pureed, or solid food during this assessment.
PROGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:
With a modified diet, the patient's potential for swallowing safety is good.
PLAN:
Based on this evaluation, the following is recommended:
1.  The patient should be on a regular diet with nectar-thick liquids to help prevent aspiration and penetration.
2.  The patient should have unthickened water in between meals to help decrease his risk of dehydration.
3.  The patient should complete good oral care two times a day to decrease bacterial growth in mouth.
4.  The patient should be seated at a 90-degree angle when eating and drinking, as well as take small bites and small sips to help decrease risk of aspiration and penetration and reflux.
Thank you for the opportunity to evaluate the patient.  I look forward to working with him in the outpatient setting to improve his swallowing function and safety.  Outpatient skilled speech therapy is recommended for a trial of neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy for muscle re-education, as well as to train patient to use swallowing techniques and maneuvers that should improve his swallowing function and safety.","[doctor] hello, mr. x, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm doing okay, thank you.
[doctor] i reviewed your modified barium swallow study and it looks like you have mild aspiration and penetration with thin liquids, but you can tolerate nectar-thick liquids, pureed and solid food without any problems. to prevent aspiration, i recommend that you stick to a regular diet with nectar-thick liquids. also, please drink unthickened water in between meals to decrease the risk of dehydration. you should also take good oral care two times a day to decrease bacterial growth in your mouth.

[doctor] mm-hmm, i see. well, the tests done show that most of the clinical tests were completed with difficulty and poor cooperation. the otoscopy showed bilateral intact tympanic membranes with central weber test and bilateral positive rinne. the romberg test showed that you maintained postural stability with difficulty. the frenzel glasses examination did not show any spontaneous, end gaze nystagmus. the dix-hallpike test did not show any positional nystagmus, which excludes benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. the head shaking and vestibuloocular reflex (halmagyi test) were done with difficulty, but a short corrective saccade may give the possibility of having a decompensated vestibular hypofunction.
[patient] oh, i see. um, that sounds complicated.
[doctor] i know it can be overwhelming, but based on the impression from the tests, it looks like you have decompensated vestibular hypofunction. we will book you for an electronystagmography and advise you to continue with your vestibular rehabilitation exercises. in addition, we will prescribe some supportive medical treatment in the form of betahistine 24mg twice a day. this should help with your symptoms.
[patient] okay, um, thank you for explaining everything to me.
[doctor] no problem at all. just make sure to follow up with your appointments and continue doing your exercises. um, let us know if your symptoms worsen or if you have any questions.",2
"SUBJECTIVE:
This is a 54-year-old female who comes for dietary consultation for weight reduction secondary to diabetes.  She did attend diabetes education classes at Abc Clinic.  She comes however, wanting to really work at weight reduction.  She indicates that she has been on the Atkins' diet for about two years and lost about ten pounds.  She is now following a veggie diet which she learned about in Poland originally.  She has been on it for three weeks and intends to follow it for another three weeks.  This does not allow any fruits or grains or starchy vegetables or meats.  She does eat nuts for protein.  She is wanting to know if she is at risk of having a severe low blood sugar reaction in this form of diet.  She also wants to know that if she gets skinny enough, if the diabetes will go away.  Her problem time, blood sugar wise, is in the morning.  She states that if she eats too much in the evening that her blood sugars are always higher the next morning.
OBJECTIVE:
Weight:  189 pounds.  Reported height:  5 feet 5 inches.  BMI is approximately 31-1/2.  Diabetes medications include metformin 500 mg daily.  Lab from 5/12/04:  Hemoglobin A1C was 6.4%.
A diet history was obtained.  I instructed the patient on dietary guidelines for weight reduction.  A 1200-calorie meal plan was recommended.
ASSESSMENT:
Patient's diet history reflects that she is highly restricting carbohydrates in her food intake.  She does not have blood sugar records with her for me to review, but we discussed strategies for improving blood sugar control in the morning.  This primarily included a recommendation of including some solid protein with her bedtime snack which could be done in the form of nuts.  She is doing some physical activity two to three times a week.  This includes aerobic walking with weights on her arms and her ankles.  She is likely going to need to increase frequency in this area to help support weight reduction.  Her basal metabolic rate was estimated at 1415 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirements for weight maintenance are estimated at 1881 calories a day.  A 1200-calorie meal plan should support a weight loss of at least one pound a week.
PLAN:
Recommend patient increase the frequency of her walking to five days a week.  Encouraged a 30-minute duration.  Also recommend patient include some solid protein with her bedtime snack to help address fasting blood sugar elevations.  And lastly, I encouraged caloric intake of just under 1200 calories daily.  Recommend keeping food records and tracking caloric intake.  It is unlikely that her blood sugars would drop significantly low on the current dose of Glucophage.  However, I encouraged her to be careful not to reduce calories below 1000 calories daily.  She may want to consider a multivitamin as well.  This was a one-hour consultation.","[doctor] hi there. i'm glad you came in for a dietary consultation. what can i help you with today?
[patient] hi, yes. i'm looking to lose weight because of my diabetes. i've been following a veggie diet i learned about in poland for the past three weeks and i want to know if i'm at risk of low blood sugar.
[doctor] understood. can you tell me a bit more about your current diet and how it's been affecting your blood sugar levels?
[patient] sure. the veggie diet doesn't allow any fruits, grains, starchy vegetables or meats, but i do eat nuts for protein. my blood sugar tends to be high in the morning if i eat too much the night before.
[doctor] i see. and have you been monitoring your blood sugar levels regularly?
[patient] no, i don't have any records with me right now.
[doctor] okay. well, i'd recommend including some solid protein with your bedtime snack to help address any fasting blood sugar elevations, and increasing the frequency of your physical activity to five days a week, for a duration of 30 minutes. it sounds like you're already doing some aerobic walking, which is great.
[patient] okay, thank you. and will losing weight help my diabetes?
[doctor] losing weight can definitely help improve your blood sugar control, but it's important to remember that diabetes is a chronic condition that requires ongoing management. i would encourage you to continue taking your medication as prescribed and monitoring your blood sugar levels regularly.
[patient] that makes sense. can you give me some dietary guidelines for weight reduction?
[doctor] of course. based on your current bmi, i would recommend a 1200-calorie meal plan to support a weight loss of at least one pound a week. it's important to keep track of your caloric intake and to try not to reduce it below 1000 calories daily. you may also want to consider taking a multivitamin supplement.

"SUBJECTIVE:
This is a followup dietary consultation for polycystic ovarian syndrome and hyperlipidemia.  The patient reports that she has resumed food record keeping which she feels like it has given her greater control.  Her physical activity level has remained high.  Her struggle times are in the mid-afternoon if she has not had enough food to eat, as well as in the evening after dinner.
OBJECTIVE:
Vital Signs:  Weight is 189-1/2 pounds.  Food records were reviewed,ASSESSMENT:
The patient has experienced a weight loss of 1-1/2 pounds in the last month.  She is commended for these efforts.  We have reviewed food records identifying that she has done a nice job keeping a calorie count for the last two or three weeks.  We discussed the value of this and how it was very difficulty to resume it, however, after she suspended the record keeping.  We also discussed its reflection that she is not getting very many fruits and vegetables on a regular basis.  We identified some ways of preventing her from feeling sluggish and having problems with low blood sugar in the middle of the afternoon by routinely planning an afternoon snack that can prevent these symptoms.  This will likely be around 2:30 or 3 p.m. for her.  We also discussed strategies for evening snacking to help put some definition and boundaries to the snacking.
PLAN:
I recommended the patient routinely include an afternoon snack around 2:30 to 3 p.m.  It will be helpful if this snack includes some protein such as nuts or low-fat cheese.  She is also encouraged to continue with her record keeping for food choices and calorie points.  I also recommended she maintain her high level of physical activity.  Will plan to follow the patient in one month for ongoing support.  This was a 30-minute consultation.","[doctor] hi, how are you doing today?

"REASON FOR EXAMINATION:
Abnormal EKG.
FINDINGS:
The patient was exercised according to standard Bruce protocol for 9 minutes achieving maximal heart rate of 146 resulting in 85% of age-predicted maximal heart rate.  Peak blood pressure was 132/60.  The patient did not experience any chest discomfort during stress or recovery.  The test was terminated due to leg fatigue and achieving target heart rate.
Electrocardiogram during stress and recovery did not reveal an additional 1 mm of ST depression compared to the baseline electrocardiogram.  Technetium was injected at 5 minutes into stress.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Good exercise tolerance.
2.  Adequate heart rate and blood pressure response.
3.  This maximal treadmill test did not evoke significant and diagnostic clinical or electrocardiographic evidence for significant occlusive coronary artery disease.

FVC was 59%.  FEV1 was 45%.  FEV1/FVC ratio was 52%. The predicted was 67%.  FEF 25/75% was 22%, improved about 400-cc, which represents 89% improvement with bronchodilator.  SVC was 91%. Inspiratory capacity was 70%.  Residual volume was 225% of its predicted.  Total lung capacity was 128%.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Moderate obstructive lung disease with some improvement with bronchodilator indicating bronchospastic element.
2.  Probably there is some restrictive element because of fibrosis.  The reason for that is that the inspiratory capacity was limited and the total lung capacity did not increase to the same extent as the residual volume and expiratory residual volume.
3.  Diffusion capacity was not measured.  The flow volume loop was consistent with the above.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Morbid obesity.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Morbid obesity.
PROCEDURE:
Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, antecolic, antegastric with 25-mm EEA anastamosis, esophagogastroduodenoscopy.
ANESTHESIA:
General with endotracheal intubation.
INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:
This is a 50-year-old male who has been overweight for many years and has tried multiple different weight loss diets and programs.  The patient has now begun to have comorbidities related to the obesity.  The patient has attended our bariatric seminar and met with our dietician and psychologist.  The patient has read through our comprehensive handout and understands the risks and benefits of bypass surgery as evidenced by the signing of our consent form.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
The risks and benefits were explained to the patient.  Consent was obtained.  The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  General anesthesia was administered with endotracheal intubation.  A Foley catheter was placed for bladder decompression.  All pressure points were carefully padded, and sequential compression devices were placed on the legs.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in standard, sterile, surgical fashion.  Marcaine was injected into the umbilicus.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after your surgery?

"FINAL DIAGNOSES,1.  Morbid obesity, status post laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Obstructive sleep apnea, on CPAP.
OPERATION AND PROCEDURE:
Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY:
This is a 30-year-old male, who presented recently to the Bariatric Center for evaluation and treatment of longstanding morbid obesity and associated comorbidities.  Underwent standard bariatric evaluation, consults, diagnostics, and preop Medifast induced weight loss in anticipation of elective bariatric surgery.
Taken to the OR via same day surgery process for elective gastric bypass, tolerated well, recovered in the PACU, and sent to the floor for routine postoperative care.  There, DVT prophylaxis was continued with subcu heparin, early and frequent mobilization, and SCDs.  PCA was utilized for pain control, efficaciously, he utilized the CPAP, was monitored, and had no new cardiopulmonary complaints.  Postop day #1, labs within normal limits, able to clinically start bariatric clear liquids at 2 ounces per hour, this was tolerated well.  He was ambulatory, had no cardiopulmonary complaints, no unusual fever or concerning symptoms.  By the second postoperative day, was able to advance to four ounces per hour, tolerated this well, and is able to discharge in stable and improved condition today.  He had his drains removed today as well.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
Include re-appointment in the office in the next week, call in the interim if any significant concerning complaints.  Scripts left in the chart for omeprazole and Lortab.  Med rec sheet completed (on no meds).  He will maintain bariatric clear liquids at home, goal 64 ounces per day, maintain activity at home, but no heavy lifting or straining.  Can shower starting tomorrow, drain site care and wound care reviewed.  He will re-appoint in the office in the next week, certainly call in the interim if any significant concerning complaints.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Bladder tumor.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Bladder tumor.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
Transurethral resection of a medium bladder tumor (TURBT), left lateral wall.
ANESTHESIA:
Spinal.
SPECIMEN TO PATHOLOGY:
Bladder tumor and specimen from base of bladder tumor.
DRAINS:
A 22-French 3-way Foley catheter, 30 mL balloon.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
Minimal.
INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:
This is a 74-year-old male who presented with microscopic and an episode of gross hematuria.  He underwent an IVP, which demonstrated enlarged prostate and normal upper tracts.  Cystoscopy in the office demonstrated a 2.5- to 3-cm left lateral wall bladder tumor.  He is brought to the operating room for transurethral resection of that bladder tumor.
DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:
After preoperative counseling of the patient and his wife, the patient was taken to the operating room and administered a spinal anesthetic.  He was placed in lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Using the visual obturator, the resectoscope was then inserted per urethra into the bladder.  The bladder was inspected confirming previous cystoscopic findings of a 2.5- to 3-cm left lateral wall bladder tumor away from the ureteral orifice.  Using the resectoscope loop, the tumor was then resected down to its base in a stepwise fashion.  Following completion of resection down to the base, the bladder was _______ free of tumor specimen.  The resectoscope was then reinserted and the base of the bladder tumor was then resected to get the base of the bladder tumor specimen, this was sent as a separate pathological specimen.  Hemostasis was assured with electrocautery.  The base of the tumor was then fulgurated again and into the periphery out in the normal mucosa surrounding the base of the bladder tumor.  Following completion of the fulguration, there was good hemostasis.  The remainder of the bladder was without evidence of significant abnormality.  Both ureteral orifices were visualized and noted to drain freely of clear urine.  The bladder was filled and the resectoscope was removed.  A 22-French 3-way Foley catheter was inserted per urethra into the bladder.  The balloon was inflated to 30 mL.  The catheter with sterile continuous irrigation and was noted to drain clear irrigant.  The patient was then removed from lithotomy position.  He was in stable condition.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] i'm feeling okay, a little sore though.
[doctor] that's normal. now, the pathology results came back and it confirmed that there was a bladder tumor.
[patient] oh, okay.
[doctor] during the procedure, we were able to resect the tumor down to its base and we also took a specimen from the base of the bladder tumor for further testing.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Benign prostatic hyperplasia.
OPERATION PERFORMED:
Transurethral electrosurgical resection of the prostate.
ANESTHESIA:
General.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
INDICATIONS FOR THE SURGERY:
This is a 77-year-old man with severe benign prostatic hyperplasia.  He has had problem with urinary retention and bladder stones in the past.  He will need to have transurethral resection of prostate to alleviate the above-mentioned problems.  Potential complications include, but are not limited to:
1.  Infection.
2.  Bleeding.
3.  Incontinence.
4.  Impotence.
5.  Formation of urethral strictures.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
The patient was identified, after which he was taken into the operating room.  General LMA anesthesia was then administered.  The patient was given prophylactic antibiotic in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was then positioned, prepped and draped.  Cystoscopy was then performed by using a #26-French continuous flow resectoscopic sheath and a visual obturator.  The prostatic urethra appeared to be moderately hypertrophied due to the lateral lobes and a large median lobe.  The anterior urethra was normal without strictures or lesions.  The bladder was severely trabeculated with multiple bladder diverticula.  There is a very bladder diverticula located in the right posterior bladder wall just proximal to the trigone.  Using the ***** resection apparatus and a right angle resection loop, the prostate was resected initially at the area of the median lobe.  Once the median lobe has completely resected, the left lateral lobe and then the right lateral lobes were taken down.  Once an adequate channel had been achieved, the prostatic specimen was retrieved from the bladder by using an Ellik evacuator.  A 3-mm bar electrode was then introduced into the prostate to achieve perfect hemostasis.  The sheath was then removed under direct vision and a #24-French Foley catheter was then inserted atraumatically with pinkish irrigation fluid obtained.  The patient tolerated the operation well.","[doctor]: hi there, how are you feeling after the transurethral electrosurgical resection of the prostate?
[patient]: i'm feeling okay, a bit sore.
[doctor]: that's normal, but we want to make sure there aren't any complications. have you noticed any bleeding or difficulty urinating?
[patient]: no, not really. it's a bit uncomfortable to urinate, but i think that's to be expected.
[doctor]: yes, that's normal. we want to make sure there aren't any complications such as infection or incontinence. but based on the surgery report, it looks like everything went well and there were no complications.
[patient]: that's good to hear.
[doctor]: now, you had the surgery because of severe benign prostatic hyperplasia. have you noticed any improvement in your urinary retention or bladder stones?
[patient]: yes, i have. i'm not having as much trouble urinating and i haven't noticed any bladder stones since the surgery.
[doctor]: that's great news. the surgery report shows that the resection of the prostate was successful, and we were able to remove the median and lateral lobes. we also discovered that your bladder was severely trabeculated with multiple bladder diverticula, but we were able to address that during the surgery as well.
[patient]: i see.
[doctor]: now, you may experience some impotence or formation of urethral strictures as potential complications of the surgery, but we will monitor you closely to make sure everything heals properly. in the meantime, make sure to follow the post-operative instructions and take any prescribed medications as directed. if you notice any unusual symptoms or have any concerns, don't hesitate to contact us.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Clinical stage Ta Nx Mx transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Clinical stage Ta Nx Mx transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder.
TITLE OF OPERATION:
Cystoscopy, transurethral resection of medium bladder tumor (4.0 cm in diameter), and direct bladder biopsy.
ANESTHESIA:
General laryngeal mask.
INDICATIONS:
This patient is a 59-year-old white male, who had an initial occurrence of a transitional cell carcinoma 5 years back.  He was found to have a new tumor last fall, and cystoscopy in November showed Ta papillary-appearing lesion inside the bladder neck anteriorly.  The patient had coronary artery disease and required revascularization, which occurred at the end of December prior to the tumor resection.  He is fully recovered and cleared by Cardiology and taken to the operating room at this time for TURBT.
FINDINGS:
Cystoscopy of the anterior and posterior urethra was within normal limits.  From 12 o'clock to 4 o'clock inside the bladder neck, there was a papillary tumor with some associated blood clot.  This was completely resected.  There was an abnormal dysplastic area in the left lateral wall that was biopsied, and the remainder of the bladder mucosa appeared normal.  The ureteral orifices were in the orthotopic location.  Prostate was 15 g and benign on rectal examination, and there was no induration of the bladder.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
The patient was brought to the cystoscopy suite, and after adequate general laryngeal mask anesthesia obtained, placed in the dorsal lithotomy position and his perineum and genitalia were sterilely prepped and draped in usual fashion.  He had been given oral ciprofloxacin for prophylaxis.  Rectal bimanual examination was performed with the findings described.  Cystourethroscopy was performed with a #23-French ACMI panendoscope and 70-degree lens with the findings described.  A barbotage urine was obtained for cytology.  The cystoscope was removed and a #24-French continuous flow resectoscope sheath was introduced over visual obturator and cold cup biopsy forceps introduced.  Several biopsies were taken from the tumor and sent to the tumor bank.  I then introduced the Iglesias resectoscope element and resected all the exophytic tumor and the lamina propria.  Because of the Ta appearance, I did not intentionally dissect deeper into the muscle.  Complete hemostasis was obtained.  All the chips were removed with an Ellik evacuator.  Using the cold cup biopsy forceps, biopsy was taken from the dysplastic area in the left bladder and hemostasis achieved.  The irrigant was clear.  At the conclusion of the procedure, the resectoscope was removed and a #24-French Foley catheter was placed for efflux of clear irrigant.  The patient was then returned to the supine position, awakened, extubated, and taken on a stretcher to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the surgery?

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Prostate cancer.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Prostate cancer.
OPERATION PERFORMED:
Radical retropubic nerve-sparing prostatectomy without lymph node dissection.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
450 mL.
REPLACEMENT:
250 mL of Cell Saver and crystalloid.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
INDICATIONS OF SURGERY:
This is a 67-year-old man with needle biopsy proven to be Gleason 6 adenocarcinoma in one solitary place on the right side of the prostate.  Due to him being healthy with no comorbid conditions, he has elected to undergo surgical treatment with radical retropubic prostatectomy.  Potential complications include, but are not limited to:
1.  Infection.
2.  Bleeding.
3.  Incontinence.
4.  Impotence.
5.  Injury to the adjacent viscera.
6.  Deep venous thrombosis.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
Prophylactic antibiotic was given in the preoperative holding area, after which the patient was transferred to the operating room.  Epidural anesthesia and general endotracheal anesthesia were administered by Dr. A without any difficulty.  The patient was shaved, prepped, and draped using the usual sterile technique.  A sterile 16-French Foley catheter was then placed with clear urine drained.  A midline infraumbilical incision was performed by using a #10 scalpel blade.  The rectus fascia and the subcutaneous space were opened by using the Bovie.  Transversalis fascia was opened in the midline and the retropubic space and the paravesical space were developed bluntly.  A Bookwalter retractor was then placed.  The area of the obturator lymph nodes were carefully inspected and no suspicious adenopathy was detected.  Given this patient's low Gleason score and low PSA with a solitary core biopsy positive, the decision was made to not perform bilateral lymphadenectomy.  The endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally by using the Metzenbaum scissors.  Opening was enlarged by using sharp dissection.  Small perforating veins from the prostate into the lateral pelvic wall were controlled by using bipolar coagulation device.  The dorsal aspect of the prostate was bunched up by using 2-0 silk sutures.  The deep dorsal vein complex was bunched up by using Allis also and ligated by using 0 Vicryl suture in a figure-of-eight fashion.  With the prostate retracted cephalad, the deep dorsal vein complex was transected superficially using the Bovie.  Deeper near the urethra, the dorsal vein complex was transected by using Metzenbaum scissors.  The urethra could then be easily identified.  Nearly two-third of the urethra from anteriorly to posteriorly was opened by using Metzenbaum scissors.  This exposed the blue Foley catheter.  Anastomotic sutures were then placed on to the urethral stump using 2-0 Monocryl suture.  Six of these were placed evenly spaced out anteriorly to posteriorly.  The Foley catheter was then removed.  This allowed for better traction of the prostate laterally.  Lateral pelvic fascia was opened bilaterally.  This effectively released the neurovascular bundle from the apex to the base of the prostate.  Continued dissection from the lateral pelvic fascia deeply opened up the plane into the perirectal fat.  The prostate was then dissected from laterally to medially from this opening in the perirectal fat.  The floor of the urethra posteriorly and the rectourethralis muscle was then transected just distal to the prostate.  Maximal length of ureteral stump was preserved.  The prostate was carefully lifted cephalad by using gentle traction with fine forceps.  The prostate was easily dissected off the perirectal fat using sharp dissection only.  Absolutely, no traction to the neurovascular bundle was evident at any point in time.  The dissection was carried out easily until the seminal vesicles could be visualized.  The prostate pedicles were controlled easily by using multiple medium clips in 4 to 5 separate small bundles on each side.  The bladder neck was then dissected out by using a bladder neck dissection method.  Unfortunately, most of the bladder neck fiber could not be preserved due to the patient's anatomy.  Once the prostate had been separated from the bladder in the area with the bladder neck, dissection was carried out posteriorly to develop a plane between the bladder and the seminal vesicles.  This was developed without any difficulty.  Both vas deferens were identified, hemoclipped and transected.  The seminal vesicles on both sides were quite large and a decision was made to not completely dissect the tip off, as it extended quite deeply into the pelvis.  About two-thirds of the seminal vesicles were able to be removed.  The tip was left behind.  Using the bipolar Gyrus coagulation device, the seminal vesicles were clamped at the tip sealed by cautery and then transected.  This was performed on the left side and then the right side.  This completely freed the prostate.  The prostate was sent for permanent section.  The opening in the bladder neck was reduced by using two separate 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  The mucosa of the bladder neck was everted by using 4-0 chromic sutures.  Small amount of bleeding around the area of the posterior bladder wall was controlled by using suture ligature.  The ureteral orifice could be seen easily from the bladder neck opening and was completely away from the everting sutures.  The previously placed anastomotic suture on the urethral stump was then placed on the corresponding position on the bladder neck.  This was performed by using a French ***** needle.  A 20-French Foley catheter was then inserted and the sutures were sequentially tied down.  A 15 mL of sterile water was inflated to balloon.  The bladder anastomosis to the urethra was performed without any difficulty.  A 19-French Blake Drain was placed in the left pelvis exiting the right inguinal region.  All instrument counts, lap counts, and latex were verified twice prior to the closure.  The rectus fascia was closed in running fashion using #1 PDS.  Subcutaneous space was closed by using 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  The skin was reapproximated by using metallic clips.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after your surgery?

1.  Cystourethroscopy.
2.  Right retrograde pyelogram.
3.  Right double-J stent placement 22 x 4.5 mm.
FIRST SECOND ANESTHESIA:
General.
SPECIMEN:
Urine for culture and sensitivity.
DRAINS:
22 x 4.5 mm right double-J ureteral stent.
PROCEDURE:
After consent was obtained, the patient was brought to operating room and placed in the supine position.  She was given general anesthesia and then placed in the dorsal lithotomy position.  A #21 French cystoscope was then passed through the urethra into the bladder.  There was noted to be some tightness of the urethra on passage.  On visualization of the bladder, there were no stones or any other debris within the bladder.  There were no abnormalities seen.  No masses, diverticuli, or other abnormal findings.  Attention was then turned to the right ureteral orifice and attempts to pass to a cone tip catheter, however, the ureteral orifice was noted to be also tight and we were unable to pass the cone tip catheter.  The cone tip catheter was removed and a glidewire was then passed without difficulty up into the renal pelvis.  An open-end ureteral catheter was then passed ________ into the distal right ureter.  Retrograde pyelogram was then performed.
There was noted to be an UPJ calculus with no noted hydronephrosis.  The wire was then passed back through the ureteral catheter.  The catheter was removed and a 22 x 4.5 mm double-J ureteral stent was then passed over the glidewire under fluoroscopic and cystoscopic guidance.  The stent was clear within the kidney as well as within the bladder.  The bladder was drained and the cystoscope was removed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  She will be discharged home.  She is to follow up with Dr. X for ESWL procedure.  She will be given prescription for Darvocet and will be asked to have a KUB x-ray done prior to her followup and to bring them with her to her appointment.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling after the procedure?

The patient was electively taken to the operating room.  In same day surgery, Dr. X applied a magnet to the pacemaker defibrillator that the patient has to change it into a fixed mode and to protect the device from the action of the cautery.  Informed consent was obtained, and the patient was transferred to the operating room where a time-out process was followed and the patient under general endotracheal anesthesia was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Local anesthesia was used as a field block and then an incision was made in the left inguinal area and carried down to the external oblique aponeurosis, which was opened.  The cord was isolated and protected.  It was dissected out.  The lipoma of the cord was removed and the sac was high ligated.  The main hernia was a direct hernia due to weakness of the floor.  A Bassini repair was performed.  We used a number of interrupted sutures of 2-0 Tevdek __________ in the conjoint tendon and the ilioinguinal ligament.
The external oblique muscle was approximated same as the soft tissue with Vicryl and then the skin was closed with subcuticular suture of Monocryl.  The dressing was applied and the patient tolerated the procedure well, estimated blood loss was minimal, was transferred to recovery room in satisfactory condition.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after the surgery?

Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
SURGERY:
Cystopyelogram and laser vaporization of the prostate.
ANESTHESIA:
Spinal.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
Minimal.
FLUIDS:
Crystalloid.
BRIEF HISTORY:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of TURP, presented to us with urgency, frequency, and dribbling.  The patient was started on alpha-blockers with some help, but had nocturia q.1h.  The patient was given anticholinergics with minimal to no help.  The patient had a cystoscopy done, which showed enlargement of the left lateral lobes of the prostate.  At this point, options were discussed such as watchful waiting and laser vaporization to open up the prostate to get a better stream.  Continuation of alpha-blockers and adding another anti-cholinergic at night to prevent bladder overactivity were discussed.  The patient was told that his symptoms may be related to the mild-to-moderate trabeculation in the bladder, which can cause poor compliance.
The patient understood and wanted to proceed with laser vaporization to see if it would help improve his stream, which in turn might help improve emptying of the bladder and might help his overactivity of the bladder.  The patient was told that he may need anticholinergics.  There could be increased risk of incontinence, stricture, erectile dysfunction, other complications and the consent was obtained.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
The patient was brought to the OR and anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was given preoperative antibiotics.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A #23-French scope was inserted inside the urethra into the bladder under direct vision.  Bilateral pyelograms were normal.  The rest of the bladder appeared normal except for some moderate trabeculations throughout the bladder.  There was enlargement of the lateral lobes of the prostate.  The old TUR scar was visualized right at the bladder neck.  Using diode side-firing fiber, the lateral lobes were taken down.  The verumontanum, the external sphincter, and the ureteral openings were all intact at the end of the procedure.  Pictures were taken and were shown to the family.  At the end of the procedure, there was good hemostasis.  A total of about 15 to 20 minutes of lasering time was used.  A #22 3-way catheter was placed.  At the end of the procedure, the patient was brought to recovery in stable condition.  Plan was for removal of the Foley catheter in 48 hours and continuation of use of anticholinergics at night.","[doctor] hi, mr. [patient], how are you feeling after the surgery?
[patient] i'm doing alright, just a little sore.
[doctor] that's normal. we performed a cystopyelogram and laser vaporization of your prostate to alleviate your symptoms of urgency, frequency, and dribbling. the surgery went well and we were able to take down the enlarged lateral lobes of your prostate.

Spinal.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
The patient was taken to the operative suite, placed on the table in the supine position, and given a spinal anesthetic.  The right inguinal region was shaved and prepped and draped in a routine sterile fashion.  The patient received 1 gm of Ancef IV push.
Transverse incision was made in the intraabdominal crease and carried through skin and subcutaneous tissue.  The external oblique fascia was exposed and incised down to and through the external inguinal ring.  The spermatic cord and hernia sac were dissected bluntly off the undersurface of the external oblique fascia exposing the attenuated floor of the inguinal canal.  The cord was surrounded with a Penrose drain.  The hernia sac was separated from the cord structures.  The floor of the inguinal canal, which consisted of attenuated transversalis fascia, was imbricated upon itself with a running locked suture of 2-0 Prolene.  Marlex patch 1 x 4 in dimension was trimmed to an appropriate shape with a defect to accommodate the cord.  It was placed around the cord and sutured to itself with 2-0 Prolene.  The patch was then sutured medially to the pubic tubercle, inferiorly to Cooper's ligament and inguinal ligaments, and superiorly to conjoined tendon using 2-0 Prolene.  The area was irrigated with saline solution, and 0.5% Marcaine with epinephrine was injected to provide prolonged postoperative pain relief.  The cord was returned to its position.  External oblique fascia was closed with a running 2-0 PDS, subcu with 2-0 Vicryl, and skin with running subdermal 4-0 Vicryl and Steri-Strips.  Sponge and needle counts were correct.  Sterile dressing was applied.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?

Spinal with local.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
DISPOSITION,:  The patient tolerated the procedure well, was transferred to recovery in stable condition.
SPECIMEN:
Hernia sac.
BRIEF HISTORY:
The patient is a 60-year-old female that presented to Dr. X's office with complaints of a bulge in the left groin.  The patient states that she noticed there this bulge and pain for approximately six days prior to arrival.  Upon examination in the office, the patient was found to have a left inguinal hernia consistent with tear, which was scheduled as an outpatient surgery.
INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS:
The patient was found to have a left indirect inguinal hernia.
PROCEDURE:
After informed consent was obtained, risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient.  The patient was brought to the operating suite.  After spinal anesthesia and sedation given, the patient was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  In the area of the left inguinal region just superior to the left inguinal ligament tract, the skin was anesthetized with 0.25% Marcaine.  Next, a skin incision was made with a #10 blade scalpel.  Using Bovie electrocautery, dissection was carried down to Scarpa's fascia until the external oblique was noted.  Along the side of the external oblique in the direction of the external ring, incision was made on both sides of the external oblique and then grasped with a hemostat.  Next, the hernia and hernia sac was circumferentially grasped and elevated along with the round ligament.  Attention was next made to ligating the hernia sac at its base for removal.  The hernia sac was opened prior grasping with hemostats.  It was a sliding indirect hernia.  The bowel contents were returned to abdomen using a #0 Vicryl stick tie pursestring suture at its base.  The hernia sac was ligated and then cut above with the Metzenbaum scissors returning it to the abdomen.  This was then sutured at the apex of the repair down to the conjoint tendon.  Next, attention was made to completely removing the round ligament hernia sac which was again ligated at its base with an #0 Vicryl suture and removed as specimen.  Attention was next made to reapproximate it at floor with a modified ______ repair.  Using a #2-0 Ethibond suture in simple interrupted fashion, the conjoint tendon was approximated to the ilioinguinal ligament capturing a little bit of the floor of the transversalis fascia.  Once this was done, the external oblique was closed over, reapproximated again with a #2-0 Ethibond suture catching each hump in between each repair from the prior floor repair.  This was done in simple interrupted fashion as well.  Next Scarpa's fascia was reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl suture.  The skin was closed with running subcuticular #4-0 undyed Vicryl suture.  Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure very well and he was transferred to Recovery in stable condition.  The patient had an abnormal chest x-ray in preop and is going for a CT of the chest in Recovery.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the surgery?
[patient] i'm doing alright. i'm a little sore, but it's manageable.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Right inguinal hernia.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Right inguinal hernia.
ANESTHESIA:
General.
PROCEDURE:
Right inguinal hernia repair.
INDICATIONS:
The patient is a 4-year-old boy with a right inguinal bulge, which comes and goes with Valsalva standing and some increased physical activity.  He had an inguinal hernia on physical exam in the Pediatric Surgery Clinic and is here now for elective repair.  We met with his parents and explained the surgical technique, risks, and talked to them about trying to perform a diagnostic laparoscopic look at the contralateral side to rule out an occult hernia.  All their questions have been answered and they agreed with the plan.
OPERATIVE FINDINGS:
The patient had a well developed, but rather thin walled hernia sac on the right.  The thinness of hernia sac made it difficult to safely cannulate through the sac for the laparoscopy.  Therefore, high ligation was performed, and we aborted the plan for laparoscopic view of the left side.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
The patient came to operating room and had an uneventful induction of general anesthesia.  Surgical time-out was conducted while we were preparing and draping his abdomen with chlorhexidine based prep solution.  During our time-out, we reiterated the patient's name, medical record number, weight, allergies status, and planned operative procedure.  I then infiltrated 0.25% Marcaine with dilute epinephrine in the soft tissues around the inguinal crease in the right lower abdomen chosen for hernia incision.  An additional aliquot of Marcaine was injected deep to the external oblique fascia performing the ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve block.  A curvilinear incision was made with a scalpel and a combination of electrocautery and some blunt dissection and scissor dissection was used to clear the tissue layers through Scarpa fascia and expose the external oblique.  After the oblique layers were opened, the cord structure were identified and elevated.  The hernia sac was carefully separated from the spermatic cord structures and control of the sac was obtained.  Dissection of the hernia sac back to the peritoneal reflection at the level of deep inguinal ring was performed.  I attempted to gently pass a 3-mm trocar through the hernia sac, but it was rather difficult and I became fearful that the sac would be torn in proximal control and mass ligation would be less effective.  I aborted the laparoscopic approach and performed a high ligation using transfixing and a simple mass ligature of 3-0 Vicryl.  The excess sac was trimmed and the spermatic cord structures were replaced.  The external oblique fascia and Scarpa layers were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl and skin was closed with subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips.  The patient tolerated the operation well.  Blood loss was less than 5 mL.  The hernia sac was submitted for specimen, and he was then taken to the recovery room in good condition.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after your surgery?
[patient] hi, doctor. i am feeling a bit sore but i am alright.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
Bladder cancer and left hydrocele.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
Bladder cancer and left hydrocele.
OPERATION:
Left hydrocelectomy, cystopyelogram, bladder biopsy, and fulguration for hemostasis.
ANESTHESIA:
Spinal.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
Minimal.
FLUIDS:
Crystalloid.
BRIEF HISTORY:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with history of smoking and hematuria, had bladder tumor, which was dissected.  He has received BCG.  The patient is doing well.  The patient was supposed to come to the OR for surveillance biopsy and pyelograms.  The patient had a large left hydrocele, which was increasingly getting worse and was making it very difficult for the patient to sit to void or put clothes on, etc.  Options such as watchful waiting, drainage in the office, and hydrocelectomy were discussed.  Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, infection in the scrotum, enlargement of the scrotum, recurrence, and pain were discussed.  The patient understood all the options and wanted to proceed with the procedure.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.
A transverse scrotal incision was made over the hydrocele sac and the hydrocele fluid was withdrawn.  The sac was turned upside down and sutures were placed.  Careful attention was made to ensure that the cord was open.  The testicle was in normal orientation throughout the entire procedure.  The testicle was placed back into the scrotal sac and was pexed with 4-0 Vicryl to the outside dartos to ensure that there was no risk of torsion.  Orchiopexy was done at 3 different locations.  Hemostasis was obtained using electrocautery.  The sac was closed using 4-0 Vicryl.  The sac was turned upside down so that when it heals, the fluid would not recollect.  The dartos was closed using 2-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed using 4-0 Monocryl and Dermabond was applied.  Incision measured about 2 cm in size.  Subsequently using ACMI cystoscope, a cystoscopy was performed.  The urethra appeared normal.  There was some scarring at the bulbar urethra, but the scope went in through that area very easily into the bladder.  There was a short prostatic fossa.  The bladder appeared normal.  There was some moderate trabeculation throughout the bladder, some inflammatory changes in the bag part, but nothing of much significance.  There were no papillary tumors or stones inside the bladder.  Bilateral pyelograms were obtained using 8-French cone-tip catheter, which appeared normal.  A cold cup biopsy of the bladder was done and was fulgurated for hemostasis.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient was brought to recovery at the end of the procedure after emptying the bladder.
The patient was given antibiotics and was told to take it easy.  No heavy lifting, pushing, or pulling.  Plan was to follow up in about 2 months.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] hi, i'm feeling a little sore, but okay overall.

INDICATIONS AND FINDINGS:
This is a 76-year-old female with history of weak stream and history of intermittent catheterization secondary to hypotonic bladder in the past, last cystoscopy approximately two years ago.
FINDINGS AT TIME OF SURGERY:
Cystourethroscopy revealed some mild narrowing of the urethra, which was easily dilated to #23 French.  A midureteral polyp was noted.  Cystoscopy revealed multiple cellules and mild trabeculation of the bladder.  Posterior wall revealed some mild erythema with some distorted architecture of the bladder mucosa.  No obvious raised bladder tumor was noted.  No foreign bodies were noted.  The ureteral orifices were noted on the trigone just proximal to the bladder neck.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
After informed consent was obtained, the patient was moved to the operating room, general anesthesia was induced by the Department of Anesthesia.  The patient was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion and urethral sounds used to dilate the urethra to accommodate #23 French cystoscope.  Cystoscopy was performed in its entirety with the above findings.  The small area of erythema on the posterior wall was biopsied using a flexible biopsy forceps and Bovie cautery was used to cauterize and fulgurate this area.  The bladder was drained, cystoscope was removed, scope was reinserted and bladder was again reexamined.  No evidence of active bleeding noted.  The bladder was drained, cystoscope was removed, and the patient was cleaned and sent to recovery room in stable condition to followup with Dr. X in two weeks.  She is given prescription for Levaquin and Pyridium and given discharge instructions.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the procedure?

ANESTHESIA:
Spinal.
SPECIMEN TO PATHOLOGY:
Urine and saline wash barbotage from right ureter through the ureteral catheter.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
Minimal.
INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:
This is a 70-year-old female who reports progressive intermittent right flank pain associated with significant discomfort and disability.  She presented to the emergency room where she was found to have significant hydronephrosis on the right without evidence of a stone.  She has some ureteral thickening in her distal right ureter.  She has persistent microscopic hematuria and her urine cytology and cytomolecular diagnosis significant for urothelial dysplasia with neoplasia-associated karyotypic profile.  She was brought to the operating room for further evaluation and treatment.
DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:
After preoperative counseling, the patient was taken to the operating room and administered a spinal anesthesia.  She was placed in the lithotomy position, prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The 21-French cystoscope was inserted per urethra into the bladder.  The bladder was inspected and found to be without evidence of intravesical tumors, stones or mucosal abnormalities.  The right ureteral orifice was visualized and cannulated with an open-ended ureteral catheter.  This was gently advanced to the mid ureter.  Urine was collected for cytology.  Retrograde injection of saline through the ureteral catheter was then also used to enhance collection of the specimen.  This too was collected and sent for a pooled urine cytology as specimen from the right renal pelvis and ureter.  An 0.038 guidewire was then passed up through the open-ended ureteral catheter.  The open-ended ureteral catheter and cystoscope were removed, and over the guidewire the flexible ureteroscope was passed up to the level of the renal pelvis.  Using direct vision and fluoroscopy to confirm location, the entire renal pelvis and calyces were inspected.  The renal pelvis demonstrated an extrarenal pelvis, but no evidence of obstruction at the renal UPJ level.  There were no intrapelvic or calyceal stones.  The ureter demonstrated no significant mucosal abnormalities, no visible tumors, and no areas of apparent constriction on multiple passes of the ureteroscope through the ureter to evaluate.  The ureteroscope was then removed.  The cystoscope was reinserted.  Once again, retrograde injection of contrast through an open-ended ureteral catheter was undertaken in the right ureter and collecting system.  No evidence of extravasation or significant change in anatomy was visualized.  The left ureteral orifice was then visualized and cannulated with an open-ended ureteral catheter, and retrograde injection of contrast demonstrated a normal left ureter and collecting system.  The cystoscope was removed.  Foley catheter was inserted.  The patient was placed in the supine position and transferred to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] i'm feeling okay, a bit sore.
[doctor] that's understandable. i just wanted to go over the results of the procedure with you. the cystoscopy and ureterorenoscopy showed that you have right hydronephrosis, which means there is a buildup of urine in your right kidney due to a blockage. however, we did not find any evidence of obstruction or lesions in your ureter or bladder. additionally, your urine cytology came back atypical/dysplastic which means there is some abnormality in the cells in your urinary tract.
[patient] oh, okay. so what's the next step?
[doctor] we collected a specimen from your right ureter through a catheter and sent it to pathology. we'll wait for those results to determine the best course of action. we did not find any stones or intrapelvic tumors, which is good news. we also confirmed that your left ureter and collecting system are normal.
[patient] that's good to hear. what caused the blockage in my right kidney?
[doctor] it's not entirely clear at this point. you have some ureteral thickening in your distal right ureter, which may be contributing to the blockage. we may need to do further testing to determine the cause.
[patient] okay, i understand. thank you for explaining everything to me.

[doctor] mm-hmm, that's understandable. so, i just wanted to go over the results of the procedure with you. the cystoscopy and ureterorenoscopy showed that you have right hydronephrosis, which means there is a buildup of urine in your right kidney due to a blockage. however, we did not find any evidence of obstruction or lesions in your ureter or bladder. additionally, your urine cytology came back atypical/dysplastic which means there is some abnormality in the cells in your urinary tract.
[patient] oh, okay. so, what's the next step?
[doctor] we collected a specimen from your right ureter through a catheter and sent it to pathology. we'll wait for those results to determine the best course of action. we did not find any stones or intrapelvic tumors, which is good news. we also confirmed that your left ureter and collecting system are normal.
[patient] got it. that's good to hear. what caused the blockage in my right kidney?
[doctor] it's not entirely clear at this point. you have some ureteral thickening in your distal right ureter, which may be contributing to the blockage. we may need to do further testing to determine the cause.
[patient] okay, i understand. thank you for explaining everything to me.
[doctor] sure thing! if you have any more questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.",1

1.  Cystourethroscopy.
2.  Right retrograde pyelogram.
3.  Right ureteral pyeloscopy.
4.  Right renal biopsy.
5.  Right double-J 4.5 x 26 mm ureteral stent placement.
ANESTHESIA:
Sedation.
SPECIMEN:
Urine for cytology and culture sensitivity, right renal pelvis urine for cytology, and right upper pole biopsies.
INDICATION:
The patient is a 74-year-old male who was initially seen in the office with hematuria.  He was then brought to the hospital for other medical problems and found to still have hematuria.  He has a CAT scan with abnormal appearing right kidney and it was felt that he will benefit from cystoscope evaluation.
PROCEDURE:
After consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  He was given IV sedation and placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  He was then prepped and draped in the standard fashion.  A #21 French cystoscope was then passed through his ureter on which patient was noted to have a hypospadias and passed through across the ends of the bladder.  The patient was noted to have mildly enlarged prostate, however, it was non-obstructing.
Upon visualization of the bladder, the patient was noted to have some tuberculation to the bladder.  There were no masses or any other abnormalities noted other than the tuberculation.  Attention was then turned to the right ureteral orifice and an open-end of the catheter was then passed into the right ureteral orifice.  A retrograde pyelogram was performed.  Upon visualization, there was no visualization of the upper collecting system on the right side.  At this point, a guidewire was then passed through the open-end of the ureteral catheter and the catheter was removed.  The bladder was drained and the cystoscope was removed.  The rigid ureteroscope was then passed into the bladder and into the right ureteral orifice with the assistance of a second glidewire.  The ureteroscope was taken all the way through the proximal ureter just below the UPJ and there were noted to be no gross abnormalities.  The ureteroscope was removed and an Amplatz wire then passed through the scope up into the collecting system along the side of the previous wire.  The ureteroscope was removed and a ureteral dilating sheath was passed over the Amplatz wire into the right ureter under fluoroscopic guidance.  The Amplatz wire was then removed and the flexible ureteroscope was passed through the sheath into the ureter.  The ureteroscope was passed up to the UPJ at which point there was noted to be difficulty entering the ureter due to UPJ obstruction.  The wire was then again passed through the flexible scope and the flexible scope was removed.  A balloon dilator was then passed over the wire and the UPJ was dilated with balloon dilation.  The dilator was then removed and again the cystoscope was passed back up into the right ureter and was able to enter the collecting system.  Upon visualization of the collecting system of the upper portion, there was noted to be papillary mass within the collecting system.  The ________ biopsy forceps were then passed through the scope and two biopsies were taken of the papillary mass.  Once this was done, the wire was left in place and the ureteroscope was removed.  The cystoscope was then placed back into the bladder and a 26 x 4.5 mm ureteral stent was passed over the wire under fluoroscopic and cystoscopic guidance into the right renal pelvis.  The stent was noted to be clear within the right renal pelvis as well as in the bladder.  The bladder was drained and the cystoscope was removed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He will be transferred to the recovery room and back to his room.  It has been discussed with his primary physician that the patient will likely need a nephrectomy.  He will be scheduled for an echocardiogram tomorrow and then decision will be made where the patient will be stable for possible nephrectomy on Wednesday.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] i feel a bit sore, but overall, i'm doing okay. 
[doctor] that's understandable. i just wanted to go over the results with you. the procedure showed a papillary mass within the collecting system of your right kidney, and two biopsies were taken of the mass. we also found out that you have a right ureteropelvic junction obstruction, which means that the flow of urine from your right kidney to your bladder is blocked. to help with this, we placed a stent in your ureter. 
[patient] okay, i see. what does this mean for me in terms of treatment? 
[doctor] well, based on the biopsy results and the fact that you have a renal mass, it's likely that you will need to have your right kidney removed in a surgery called a nephrectomy. however, we will need to wait for the results of the echocardiogram tomorrow to make sure you are stable enough for surgery. 
[patient] okay, that makes sense. is there anything i need to do to prepare for the surgery?

DISPOSITION:
The patient was transferred to the PACU in stable condition.
INDICATIONS AND FINDINGS:
This is an 84-year-old male with history of BPH and subsequent urinary retention with failure of trial of void, scheduled for elective TURP procedure.
FINDINGS:
At the time of surgery, cystourethroscopy revealed trilobar enlargement of the prostate with prostatic varices of the median lobe.  Cystoscopy showed a few cellules of the bladder with no obvious bladder tumors noted.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
After informed consent was obtained, the patient was moved to operating room and spinal anesthesia was induced by the Department of Anesthesia.  The patient was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion and a #21 French cystoscope inserted into urethra and into the bladder.  Cystoscopy performed with the above findings.  Cystoscope was removed.  A #27 French resectoscope with a #26 cutting loop was inserted into the bladder.  Verumontanum was identified as a landmark and systematic transurethral resection of the prostate tissue was undertaken in an circumferential fashion with good resection of tissue completed.  ________ irrigator was used to evacuate the bladder of prostatic chips.  Resectoscope was then inserted and any residual chips were removed in piecemeal fashion with a resectoscope loop.  Any obvious bleeding from the prostatic fossa was controlled with electrocautery.  Resectoscope was removed.  A #24 French three-way Foley catheter inserted into the urethra and into the bladder.  Bladder was irrigated and connected to three-way irrigation.  The patient was cleaned and sent to recovery in stable condition to be admitted overnight for continuous bladder irrigation and postop monitoring.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?

[doctor] i'm glad to hear that. during the surgery, we found that your prostate was enlarged with prostatic varices of the median lobe. we performed a systematic transurethral resection of the prostate tissue to relieve your urinary retention. we used a #24 french three-way foley catheter to help with continuous bladder irrigation and to monitor your post-op condition. the estimated blood loss was 150 cc, which is normal for this procedure.
[patient] okay. that sounds like a lot of medical terms. can you explain it to me in layman's terms?
[doctor] sure. we found that your prostate was enlarged and blocking your urine flow. we used a scope to remove some of the prostate tissue to relieve the blockage, and inserted a catheter to help with your bladder function. we'll be monitoring your condition overnight to ensure that your bladder is functioning properly and to help prevent any complications.
[patient] oh, okay. thank you for explaining that to me. when can i expect to have the catheter removed?
[doctor] we'll be monitoring your urine output and making sure that your bladder is functioning properly. if everything looks good, we should be able to remove the catheter in the next day or so.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Gross hematuria.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Gross hematuria.
OPERATIONS:
Cystopyelogram, clot evacuation, transurethral resection of the bladder tumor x2 on the dome and on the left wall of the bladder.
ANESTHESIA:
Spinal.
FINDINGS:
Significant amount of bladder clots measuring about 150 to 200 mL, two cupful of clots were removed.  There was papillary tumor on the left wall right at the bladder neck and one on the right dome near the bladder neck on the right side.  The right ureteral opening was difficult to visualize, the left one was normal.
BRIEF HISTORY:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with history of gross hematuria and recurrent UTIs.  The patient had hematuria.  Cystoscopy revealed atypical biopsy.  The patient came in again with gross hematuria.  The first biopsy was done about a month ago.  The patient was to come back and have repeat biopsies done, but before that came into the hospital with gross hematuria.  The options of watchful waiting, removal of the clots and biopsies were discussed.  Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT and PE were discussed.  Morbidity and mortality of the procedure were discussed.  Consent was obtained from the daughter-in-law who has the power of attorney in Florida.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The patient had been off of the Coumadin for about 4 days and INR had been reversed.  The patient has significant amount of clot upon entering the bladder.  There was a tight bladder neck contracture.  The prostate was not enlarged.  Using ACMI 24-French sheath, using Ellick irrigation about 2 cupful of clots were removed.  It took about half an hour to just remove the clots.  After removing the clots, using 24-French cutting loop resectoscope, tumor on the left upper wall near the dome or near the 2 o'clock position was resected.  This was lateral to the left ureteral opening.  The base was coagulated for hemostasis.  Same thing was done at 10 o'clock on the right side where there was some tumor that was visualized.  The back wall and the rest of the bladder appeared normal.  Using 8-French cone-tip catheter, left-sided pyelogram was normal.  The right-sided pyelogram was very difficult to obtain and there was some mucosal irritation from the clots.  The contrast did go up to what appeared to be the right ureteral opening, but the mucosa seemed to be very much irritated and it was very difficult to actually visualize the opening.  A little bit of contrast went out, but the force was not made just to avoid any secondary stricture formation.  The patient did have CT with contrast, which showed that the kidneys were normal.  At this time, a #24 three-way irrigation was started.  The patient was brought to Recovery room in stable condition.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] hi, i feel a bit groggy but okay.
[doctor] good to hear. we completed the procedure to remove clots and tumors from your bladder. we found a significant amount of clots in your bladder, which we removed successfully. the good news is that your left ureteral opening was normal, but we did have difficulty visualizing your right ureteral opening due to mucosal irritation from the clots. we did manage to visualize it partially, but we didn't want to risk any secondary stricture formation by applying too much force. we also found two papillary tumors, one on the left wall and the other on the right dome near the bladder neck. we used a cutting loop resectoscope to remove them and coagulated the base for hemostasis.

LMA.
EBL:
Minimal.
FLUIDS:
Crystalloid.  The patient was given antibiotics, 1 g of Ancef and the patient was on oral antibiotics at home.
BRIEF HISTORY:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with history of recurrent uroseptic stones.  The patient had stones x2, 1 was already removed, second one came down, had recurrent episode of sepsis, stent was placed.  Options were given such as watchful waiting, laser lithotripsy, shockwave lithotripsy etc.  Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, need for stent, and removal of the stent were discussed.  The patient understood and wanted to proceed with the procedure.
DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:
The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A 0.035 glidewire was placed in the left system.  Using graspers, left-sided stent was removed.  A semirigid ureteroscopy was done.  A stone was visualized in the mid to upper ureter.  Using laser, the stone was broken into 5 to 6 small pieces.  Using basket extraction, all the pieces were removed.  Ureteroscopy all the way up to the UPJ was done, which was negative.  There were no further stones.  Using pyelograms, the rest of the system appeared normal.  The entire ureter on the left side was open and patent.  There were no further stones.  Due to the edema and the surgery, plan was to leave the stent attached to the string and the patient was to pull the string in about 24 hours.  Over the 0.035 glidewire, a 26 double-J stent was placed.  There was a nice curl in the kidney and one in the bladder.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Please note that the string was kept in place and the patient was to remove the stent the next day.  The patient's family was instructed how to do so.  The patient had antibiotics and pain medications at home.  The patient was brought to recovery room in a stable condition.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling?

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Prostatism.
2.  Bladder calculus.
OPERATION:
Holmium laser cystolithalopaxy.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Prostatism.
2.  Bladder calculus.
ANESTHESIA:
General.
INDICATIONS:
This is a 62-year-old male diabetic and urinary retention with apparent neurogenic bladder and intermittent self-catheterization, recent urinary tract infections.  The cystoscopy showed a large bladder calculus, short but obstructing prostate.  He comes in now for transurethral resection of his prostate and holmium laser cystolithotripsy.
He is a diabetic with obesity.
LABORATORY DATA:
Includes urinalysis showing white cells too much to count, 3-5 red cells, occasional bacteria.  He had a serum creatinine of 1.2, sodium 138, potassium 4.6, glucose 190, calcium 9.1.  Hematocrit 40.5, hemoglobin 13.8, white count 7,900.
PROCEDURE:
The patient was satisfactorily given general anesthesia.  Prepped and draped in the dorsal lithotomy position.  A 27-French Olympus rectoscope was passed via the urethra into the bladder.  The bladder, prostate, and urethra were inspected.  He had an obstructing prostate.  He had marked catheter reaction in his bladder.  He had a lot of villous changes, impossible to tell from frank tumor.  He had a huge bladder calculus.  It was white and round.
I used the holmium laser with the largest fiber through the continuous flow resectoscope and sheath, and broke up the stone, breaking up approximately 40 grams of stone.  There was still stone left at the end of the procedure.  Most of the chips that could be irrigated out of the bladder were irrigated out using Ellik.
Then the scope was removed and a 24-French 3-way Foley catheter was passed via the urethra into the bladder.
The plan is to probably discharge the patient in the morning and then we will get a KUB.  We will probably bring him back for a second stage cystolithotripsy, and ultimately do a TURP.  We broke up the stone for over an hour, and my judgment continuing with litholapaxy transurethrally over an hour begins to markedly increase the risk to the patient.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] hi, doctor. i'm feeling a bit groggy, but i think i'm doing okay.
[doctor] that's to be expected after a general anesthetic. let's go over the procedure. we found that you had a large bladder calculus and a prostate that was obstructing your urethra. we used the holmium laser to break up the stone, which was about 40 grams in weight. we weren't able to remove it all during the procedure, but we did remove most of it. we also inserted a catheter into your bladder to help with urination.
[patient] okay, that sounds good. what's the plan moving forward?
[doctor] well, we'll keep you overnight and then perform a kub to see if there's any remaining stone. if there is, we'll perform a second stage cystolithotripsy to remove it. ultimately, we'll perform a turp to remove the obstructing prostate. we'll take things one step at a time to ensure your safety.
[patient] alright, thank you, doctor. when can i expect to go home?
[doctor] we'll monitor your condition overnight, and if everything looks good, we'll discharge you in the morning. in the meantime, we'll keep you comfortable and make sure you're not experiencing any pain.

The patient had a stent placed at that time due to the fevers, thinking that this was an urospetic stone.  There was some pus that came out.  The patient was cultured; actually it was negative at that time.  The patient subsequently was found to have lower extremity DVT and then was started on Coumadin.  The patient cannot be taken off Coumadin for the next 6 months due to the significant swelling and high risk for PE.  The repeat films were taken which showed the stone had migrated into the pole.
The stent was intact.  The patient subsequently developed recurrent UTIs and Enterococcus in the urine with fevers.  The patient was admitted for IV antibiotics since the patient could not really tolerate penicillin due to allergy and due to patient being on Coumadin, Cipro, and Levaquin where treatment was little bit more complicated.  Due to drug interaction, the patient was admitted for IV antibiotic treatment.  The thinking was that either the stone or the stent is infected, since the stone is pretty small in size, the stent is very likely possibility that it could have been infected and now it needs to be removed.  Since the stone is not obstructing, there is no reason to replace the stent at this time.  We are unable to do the ureteroscopy or the shock-wave lithotripsy when the patient is fully anticoagulated.  So, the best option at this time is to probably wait and perform the ureteroscopic laser lithotripsy when the patient is allowed to off her Coumadin, which would be probably about 4 months down the road.
Plan is to get rid of the stent and improve patient's urinary symptoms and to get rid of the infection and we will worry about the stone at later point.
DETAILS OF THE OR:
Consent had been obtained from the patient.  Risks, benefits, and options were discussed.  Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, and PE were discussed.  The patient understood all the risks and benefits of removing the stent and wanted to proceed.  The patient was brought to the OR.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was given some IV pain meds.  The patient had received vancomycin and Levaquin preop.  Cystoscopy was performed using graspers.  The stent was removed without difficulty.  Plan was for repeat cultures and continuation of the IV antibiotics.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling?
[patient] i'm feeling okay, just a little sore.
[doctor] that's understandable. so, we removed the stent during surgery because we suspected that it may have been infected. we will be continuing the iv antibiotics and take repeat cultures to ensure that the infection is fully treated. 
[patient] okay, thank you for letting me know.
[doctor] no problem. we also found a lower pole renal stone during your ct scan. since the stone is not causing any obstruction, we will wait until you are off coumadin to perform the ureteroscopic laser lithotripsy.
[patient] sounds good.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Vitreous hemorrhage and retinal detachment, right eye.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Vitreous hemorrhage and retinal detachment, right eye.
NAME OF PROCEDURE:
Combined closed vitrectomy with membrane peeling, fluid-air exchange, and endolaser, right eye.
ANESTHESIA:
Local with standby.
PROCEDURE:
The patient was brought to the operating room, and an equal mixture of Marcaine 0.5% and lidocaine 2% was injected in a retrobulbar fashion.  As soon as satisfactory anesthesia and akinesia had been achieved, the patient was prepped and draped in the usual manner for sterile ophthalmic surgery.  A wire lid speculum was inserted.  Three modified sclerotomies were selected at 9, 10, and 1 o'clock.  At the 9 o'clock position, the Accurus infusion line was put in place and tied with a preplaced #7-0 Vicryl suture.  The two superior sites at 10 and 1 were opened up where the operating microscope with the optical illuminating system was brought into position, and closed vitrectomy was begun.  Initially formed core vitrectomy was performed and formed anterior vitreous was removed.  After this was completed, attention was placed in the posterior segment.  Several broad areas of vitreoretinal traction were noted over the posterior pole out of the equator where the previously noted retinal tears were noted.  These were carefully lifted and dissected off the edges of the flap tears and trimmed to the ora serrata.  After all the vitreous had been removed and the membranes released, the retina was completely mobilized.  Total fluid-air exchange was carried out with complete settling of the retina.  Endolaser was applied around the margins of the retinal tears, and altogether several 100 applications were placed in the periphery.  Good reaction was achieved.  The eye was inspected with an indirect ophthalmoscope.  The retina was noted to be completely attached.  The instruments were removed from the eye.  The sclerotomy sites were closed with #7-0 Vicryl suture.  The infusion line was removed from the eye and tied with a #7-0 Vicryl suture.  The conjunctivae and Tenon's were closed with #6-0 plain gut suture.  A collagen shield soaked with Tobrex placed over the surface of the globe, and a pressure bandage was put in place.  The patient left the operating room in a good condition.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] a little groggy, but okay, i think.
[doctor] that's normal. i just wanted to talk to you about what we did during the procedure. so, we performed a combined closed vitrectomy with membrane peeling, fluid-air exchange, and endolaser on your right eye. this was because you had a vitreous hemorrhage and a retinal detachment in that eye.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] we used a local anesthetic, and once you were properly numb, we began the procedure. we made three small openings in your eye, and using a microscope, we performed a vitrectomy, which is the removal of the vitreous humor, the gel-like substance in the eye. we then removed the membranes that were causing the retinal detachment and trimmed them to the ora serrata, the edge of the retina. after this, we completely mobilized the retina and performed a fluid-air exchange to settle the retina. we also used endolaser to apply several hundred applications around the margins of the retinal tears to seal them. after we inspected your eye and saw that the retina was completely attached, we closed the sclerotomy sites and the infusion line with sutures. we also closed the conjunctivae and tenon's with sutures, placed a collagen shield soaked in tobrex over the eye, and put a pressure bandage in place.
[patient] wow, that sounds like a lot.
[doctor] it was a complicated procedure, but we're confident that it will help your eye heal properly. now, you'll need to come back for follow-up appointments so we can monitor your progress. is there anything else you want to know?
[patient] no, i think that's it for now.

[doctor] yeah, that's pretty normal. so, i just wanted to chat with you about what we did during the procedure. we performed a combined closed vitrectomy with membrane peeling, fluid-air exchange, and endolaser on your right eye. this was because you had a vitreous hemorrhage and a retinal detachment in that eye.
[patient] mm-hmm, okay.
[doctor] we used a local anesthetic and once you were properly numb, we got started. we made three small openings in your eye and, using a microscope, performed a vitrectomy which is the removal of the vitreous humor, the gel-like substance in the eye. then, we removed the membranes that were causing the retinal detachment and trimmed them to the ora serrata, the edge of the retina. after that, we completely mobilized the retina and performed a fluid-air exchange to settle the retina. we also used endolaser to apply several hundred applications around the margins of the retinal tears to seal them. once we inspected your eye and saw that the retina was completely attached, we closed the sclerotomy sites and the infusion line with sutures. we also closed the conjunctivae and tenon's with sutures, placed a collagen shield soaked in tobrex over the eye, and put a pressure bandage in place.
[patient] wow, that sounds like a lot.
[doctor] yeah, it was a pretty complicated procedure but we're confident that it'll help your eye heal properly. now, you'll need to come back for follow-up appointments so we can monitor your progress. is there anything else you want to know?
[patient] uhh, no, i think that's it for now.
[doctor] alright, take it easy and get some rest, and we'll see you soon.",1
"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Aqueductal stenosis.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Aqueductal stenosis.
TITLE OF PROCEDURE:
Endoscopic third ventriculostomy.
ANESTHESIA:
General endotracheal tube anesthesia.
DEVICES:
Bactiseal ventricular catheter with an Aesculap burr hole port.
SKIN PREPARATION:
ChloraPrep.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
SPECIMENS:
CSF for routine studies.
INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION:
Triventricular hydrocephalus most consistent with aqueductal stenosis.  The patient having a long history of some intermittent headaches, macrocephaly.
OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:
After satisfactory general endotracheal tube anesthesia was administered, the patient was positioned on the operating table in supine position with the head neutral.  The right frontal area was shaven and then the head was prepped and draped in a standard routine manner.  The area of the proposed scalp incision was infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine.  A curvilinear scalp incision was made extending from just posterior to bregma curving up in the midline and then going off to the right anterior to the coronal suture.  Two Weitlaner were used to hold the scalp open.  A burr hole was made just anterior to the coronal suture and then the dura was opened in a cruciate manner and the pia was coagulated.  Neuropen was introduced directly through the parenchyma into the ventricular system, which was quite large and dilated.  CSF was collected for routine studies.  We saw the total absence of __________  consistent with the congenital form of aqueductal stenosis and a markedly thinned down floor of the third ventricle.  I could bend the ventricular catheter and look back and see the aqueduct, which was quite stenotic with a little bit of chorioplexus near its opening.  The NeuroPEN was then introduced through the midline of the floor of the third ventricle anterior to the mamillary bodies in front of the basilar artery and then was gently enlarged using NeuroPEN __________  various motions.  We went through the membrane of Liliequist.  We could see the basilar artery and the clivus, and there was no significant bleeding from the edges.  The Bactiseal catheter was then left to 7 cm of length because of her macrocephaly and secured to a burr hole port with a 2-0 Ethibond suture.  The wound was irrigated out with bacitracin and closed using 3-0 Vicryl for the deep layer and a Monocryl suture for the scalp followed by Mastisol and Steri-Strips.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after your procedure?
[patient] i'm feeling okay, a little groggy still.
[doctor] that's normal after anesthesia. i wanted to go over the results of your procedure. we performed an endoscopic third ventriculostomy to treat your aqueductal stenosis.
[patient] okay, what does that mean?
[doctor] it means we made a small incision on your scalp, and then used a tool to make a hole in the floor of your third ventricle to allow the cerebrospinal fluid to flow more freely. we confirmed that you did indeed have aqueductal stenosis, which is a narrowing of the passageway that allows the fluid to flow. we also noticed a markedly thinned down floor of the third ventricle.
[patient] is that bad?
[doctor] it's not necessarily bad, but it can be a sign of the aqueductal stenosis. we were able to successfully enlarge the opening using the tool and we inserted a bactiseal ventricular catheter to help the fluid flow properly. we also collected some csf for routine studies, but we don't anticipate any complications from the procedure.
[patient] okay. what do i need to do next?
[doctor] you'll need to come back for a follow-up appointment so we can check on your progress and make sure everything is working properly. in the meantime, it's important to take it easy and avoid any strenuous activities until we give you the green light. we'll also go over any pain management protocols if necessary.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Vitreous hemorrhage, right eye.
PROCEDURE:
Vitrectomy, right eye.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
The patient was prepared and draped in the usual manner for a vitrectomy procedure under local anesthesia.  Initially, a 5 cc retrobulbar injection was performed with 2% Xylocaine during monitored anesthesia control.  A Lancaster lid speculum was applied and the conjunctiva was opened 4 mm posterior to the limbus.  MVR incisions were made 4 mm posterior to the limbus in the *** and *** o'clock meridians following which the infusion apparatus was positioned in the *** o'clock site and secured with a 5-0 Vicryl suture.  Then, under indirect ophthalmoscopic control, the vitrector was introduced through the *** o'clock site and a complete vitrectomy was performed.  All strands of significance were removed.  Tractional detachment foci were apparent posteriorly along the temporal arcades.  Next, endolaser coagulation was applied to ischemic sites and to neovascular foci under indirect ophthalmoscopic control.  Finally, an air exchange procedure was performed, also under indirect ophthalmoscopic control.  The intraocular pressure was within the normal range.  The globe was irrigated with a topical antibiotic.  The MVR incisions were closed with 7-0 Vicryl.  No further manipulations were necessary.  The conjunctiva was closed with 6-0 plain catgut.  An eye patch was applied and the patient was sent to the recovery area in good condition.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?

3.  Non-reassuring fetal heart tones.
PROCEDURES,1.  Vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery of a third-degree midline laceration and right vaginal side wall laceration.
2.  Repair of the third-degree midline laceration lasting for 25 minutes.
ANESTHESIA:
Local.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
300 mL.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
FINDINGS,1.  Live male infant with Apgars of 9 and 9.
2.  Placenta delivered spontaneously intact with a three-vessel cord.
DISPOSITION:
The patient and baby remain in the LDR in stable condition.
SUMMARY:
This is a 36-year-old G1 woman who was pregnant since 40 weeks 6 days when she was admitted for induction of labor for post dates with favorable cervix.  When she was admitted, her cervix was 2.5 cm dilated with 80% effacement.  The baby had a -2 station.  She had no regular contractions.  Fetal heart tones were 120s and reactive.  She was started on Pitocin for labor induction and labored quite rapidly.  She had spontaneous rupture of membranes with a clear fluid.  She had planned on an epidural; however, she had sudden rapid cervical change and was unable to get the epidural.  With the rapid cervical change and descent of fetal head, there were some variable decelerations.  The baby was at a +1 station when the patient began pushing.  I had her push to get the baby to a +2 station.  During pushing, the fetal heart tones were in the 80s and did not recover in between contractions.  Because of this, I recommended a vacuum delivery for the baby.  The patient agreed.
The baby's head was confirmed to be in the right occiput anterior presentation.  The perineum was injected with 1% lidocaine.  The bladder was drained.  The vacuum was placed and the correct placement in front of the posterior fontanelle was confirmed digitally.  With the patient's next contraction, the vacuum was inflated and a gentle downward pressure was used to assist with brining the baby's head to a +3 station.  The contraction ended.  The vacuum was released and the fetal heart tones remained in the, at this time, 90s to 100s.  With the patient's next contraction, the vacuum was reapplied and the baby's head was delivered to a +4 station.  A modified Ritgen maneuver was used to stabilize the fetal head.  The vacuum was deflated and removed.  The baby's head then delivered atraumatically.  There was no nuchal cord.  The baby's anterior shoulder delivered after a less than 30 second delay.  No additional maneuvers were required to deliver the anterior shoulder.  The posterior shoulder and remainder of the body delivered easily.  The baby's mouth and nose were bulb suctioned.  The cord was clamped x2 and cut.  The infant was handed to the respiratory therapist.
Pitocin was added to the patient's IV fluids.  The placenta delivered spontaneously, was intact and had a three-vessel cord.  A vaginal inspection revealed a third-degree midline laceration as well as a right vaginal side wall laceration.  The right side wall laceration was repaired with #3-0 Vicryl suture in a running fashion with local anesthesia.  The third-degree laceration was also repaired with #3-0 Vicryl sutures.  Local anesthesia was used.  The capsule was visible, but did not appear to be injured at all.  It was reinforced with three separate interrupted sutures and then the remainder of the incision was closed with #3-0 Vicryl in the typical fashion.
The patient tolerated the procedure very well.  She remains in the LDR with the baby.  The baby is vigorous, crying and moving all extremities.  He will go to the new born nursery when ready.  The total time for repair of the laceration was 25 minutes.","[doctor]: hi, how are you feeling after the delivery?
[patient]: i'm feeling okay, a bit sore.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
A 10-1/2 week pregnancy, spontaneous, incomplete abortion.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
A 10-1/2 week pregnancy, spontaneous, incomplete abortion.
PROCEDURE:
Exam under anesthesia with uterine suction curettage.
ANESTHESIA:
Spinal.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
Less than 10 cc.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
DRAINS:
None.
CONDITION:
Stable.
INDICATIONS:
The patient is a 29-year-old gravida 5, para 1-0-3-1, with an LMP at 12/18/05.  The patient was estimated to be approximately 10-1/2 weeks so long in her pregnancy.  She began to have heavy vaginal bleeding and intense lower pelvic cramping.  She was seen in the emergency room where she was found to be hemodynamically stable.  On pelvic exam, her cervix was noted to be 1 to 2 cm dilated and approximately 90% effaced.  There were bulging membranes protruding through the dilated cervix.  These symptoms were consistent with the patient's prior experience of spontaneous miscarriages.  These findings were reviewed with her and options for treatment discussed.  She elected to proceed with an exam under anesthesia with uterine suction curettage.  The risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed with her and knowing these, she gave informed consent.
PROCEDURE:
The patient was taken to the operating room where she was placed in the seated position.  A spinal anesthetic was successfully administered.  She was then moved to a dorsal lithotomy position.  She was prepped and draped in the usual fashion for the procedure.  After adequate spinal level was confirmed, a bimanual exam was again performed.  This revealed the uterus to be anteverted to axial and approximately 10 to 11 weeks in size.  The previously noted cervical exam was confirmed.  The weighted vaginal speculum was then inserted and the vaginal vault flooded with povidone solution.  This solution was then removed approximately 10 minutes later with dry sterile gauze sponge.  The anterior cervical lip was then attached with a ring clamp.  The tissue and membranes protruding through the os were then gently grasped with a ring clamp and traction applied.  The tissue dislodged revealing fluid mixed with blood as well as an apparent 10-week fetus.  The placental tissue was then gently tractioned out as well.  A size 9 curved suction curette was then gently inserted through the dilated os and into the endometrial cavity.  With the vacuum tubing applied in rotary motion, a moderate amount of tissue consistent with products of conception was evacuated.  The sharp curette was then utilized to probe the endometrial surface.  A small amount of additional tissue was then felt in the posterior uterine wall.  This was curetted free.  A second pass was then made with a vacuum curette.  Again, the endometrial cavity was probed with a sharp curette and no significant additional tissue was encountered.  A final pass was then made with a suction curette.
The ring clamp was then removed from the anterior cervical lip.  There was only a small amount of bleeding following the curettage.  The weighted speculum was then removed as well.  The bimanual exam was repeated and good involution was noted.  The patient was taken down from the dorsal lithotomy position.  She was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  The sponge and instrument count was performed and found to be correct.  The specimen of products of conception and 10-week fetus were submitted to Pathology for further evaluation.  The estimated blood loss for the procedure is less than 10 mL.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after the procedure?

INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:
The patient is a 1-year-old male with a history of chronic otitis media with effusion and conductive hearing loss refractory to outpatient medical therapy.  After risks, complications, consequences, and questions were addressed with the family, a written consent was obtained for the procedure.
PROCEDURE:
The patient was brought to the operative suite by Anesthesia.  The patient was placed on the operating table in supine position.  After this, the patient was then placed under general mask airway and the patient's head was then turned to the left.
The Zeiss operative microscope and medium-sized ear speculum were placed and the cerumen from the external auditory canals were removed with a cerumen loop to #5 suction.  After this, the tympanic membrane is then brought into direct visualization with no signs of any gross retracted pockets or cholesteatoma.  A myringotomy incision was then made within the posterior inferior quadrant and the middle ear was then suctioned with a #5 suction demonstrating dry contents.  A _____ split tube 1.0 mm was then placed in the myringotomy incision utilizing a alligator forcep.  Cortisporin Otic drops were placed followed by cotton balls.  Attention was then drawn to the left ear with the head turned to the right and the medium sized ear speculum placed.  The external auditory canal was removed off of its cerumen with a #5 suction which led to the direct visualization of the tympanic membrane.  The tympanic membrane appeared with no signs of retraction pockets, cholesteatoma or air fluid levels.  A myringotomy incision was then made within the posterior inferior quadrant with a myringotomy blade after which a _________ split tube 1.0 mm was then placed with an alligator forcep.  After this, the patient had Cortisporin Otic drops followed by cotton balls placed.  The patient was then turned back to Anesthesia and transferred to recovery room in stable condition and tolerated the procedure very well.  The patient will be followed up approximately in one week and was sent home with a prescription for Ciloxan ear drops to be used as directed and with instructions not to get any water in the ears.","[doctor] hi there! how are you and your little one doing today?
[patient] hi, we're doing well, thank you.

[patient] yes, my child has been struggling with chronic otitis media with effusion and conductive hearing loss, and despite trying outpatient medical therapy, there was no improvement.
[doctor] i see. well, the good news is that the procedure went smoothly and there were no complications. we removed the cerumen from the external auditory canals and placed a tube in each ear. the tympanic membranes appeared normal and we followed up with cortisporin otic drops and cotton balls to help with the healing process. 
[patient] that's a relief to hear.
[doctor] yes, it is. your child will need to avoid getting any water in the ears for now and we provided a prescription for ciloxan ear drops to be used as directed. we'll follow up in about a week to check on the healing progress.

[doctor] gotcha. well, the good news is that everything went smoothly during the procedure and there were no complications. we cleaned out the cerumen from the external auditory canals and put a tube in each ear. the tympanic membranes looked normal and we gave you cortisporin otic drops and cotton balls to help with the healing. 
[patient] mm-hmm, that's good to know.
[doctor] yes, it definitely is. your kid will need to steer clear of getting any water in their ears for now and we gave you a prescription for ciloxan ear drops to use as directed. we'll check in about a week from now to track the healing progress.
[patient] thanks so much for all your help.
[doctor] no problem at all! if you have any worries or questions in the meantime, don't hesitate to give us a shout.",1
"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Adenotonsillar hypertrophy and chronic otitis media.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Adenotonsillar hypertrophy and chronic otitis media.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
1.  Tympanostomy and tube placement.
2.  Adenoidectomy.
ANESTHESIA:
General endotracheal.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
The patient was taken to the operating room, prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  After induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the McIvor mouth gag was placed in the oral cavity and a tongue depressor applied.  Two #12-French red rubber Robinson catheters were placed, 1 in each nasal passage, and brought out through the oral cavity and clamped over a dental gauze roll placed on the upper lip to provide soft palate retraction.
Attention was directed to the nasopharynx.  With the Bovie set at 50 coag and the suction Bovie tip on the suction hose, the adenoid bed was fulgurated by beginning at the posterosuperior aspect of the nasopharynx at the apex of the choana placing the tip of the suction cautery deep at the root of the adenoids next to the roof of the nasopharynx and then in a linear fashion making serial passages through the base of the adenoid fossa in parallel lines until the entire nasopharynx and adenoid bed had been fulgurated moving from posterior to anterior.  The McIvor was relaxed and attention was then directed to the ears.
The left external auditory canal was examined under the operating microscope and cleaned of ceruminous debris.
An anteroinferior quadrant tympanostomy incision was made.  Fluid was suctioned from the middle ear space, and a tympanostomy tube was placed at the level of the incision and pushed into position with the Rosen needle.  Cortisporin ear drops were instilled into the canal, and a cotton ball was placed in the external meatus.
By a similar procedure, the opposite tympanostomy and tube placement were accomplished.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the operating room in good condition.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] hi doctor, i'm feeling okay, a little soreness in my throat.
[doctor] that's normal, you had a tympanostomy and tube placement, and an adenoidectomy done. the procedure went well, you were under general anesthesia during the surgery.
[patient] yes, i was. can you explain to me what exactly was done?
[doctor] sure. after you were under anesthesia, we placed two catheters in your nasal passages which were brought out through the mouth and clamped over a dental gauze roll. this helped in providing soft palate retraction. then, we focused on your nasopharynx and used a bovie to fulgurate the adenoid bed. we began at the posterosuperior aspect of the nasopharynx and made linear passages through the base of the adenoid fossa until the entire nasopharynx and adenoid bed were fulgurated. after that, we examined your ears under an operating microscope, cleaned them out of any debris, and made an anteroinferior quadrant tympanostomy incision. we suctioned out any fluid from the middle ear space and placed a tympanostomy tube in each ear. cortisporin ear drops were instilled into both ears, and cotton balls were placed in the external meatus. 
[patient] okay, that sounds like a lot. will i be in a lot of pain after this?
[doctor] you may experience some soreness in your throat and ears, but we've prescribed some pain medication to help with that. it's important to take it easy and avoid any strenuous activities for a few days. you should also avoid getting water in your ears while showering or bathing. do you have any other questions or concerns?

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
Left cubital tunnel syndrome and ulnar nerve entrapment.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
Left cubital tunnel syndrome and ulnar nerve entrapment.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
Decompression of the ulnar nerve, left elbow.
ANESTHESIA:
General.
FINDINGS OF THE OPERATION:
The ulnar nerve appeared to be significantly constricted as it passed through the cubital tunnel.  There was presence of hourglass constriction of the ulnar nerve.
PROCEDURE:
The patient was brought to the operating room and once an adequate general anesthesia was achieved, his left upper extremity was prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.  A sterile tourniquet was positioned and tourniquet was inflated at 250 mmHg.  Perioperative antibiotics were infused.  Time-out procedure was called.  The medial epicondyle and the olecranon tip were well palpated.  The incision was initiated at equidistant between the olecranon and the medial epicondyle extending 3-4 cm proximally and 6-8 cm distally.  The ulnar nerve was identified proximally.  It was mobilized with a blunt and a sharp dissection proximally to the arcade of Struthers, which was released sharply.  The roof of the cubital tunnel was then incised and the nerve was mobilized distally to its motor branches.  The ulnar nerve was well-isolated before it entered the cubital tunnel.  The arch of the FCU was well defined.  The fascia was elevated from the nerve and both the FCU fascia and the Osborne fascia were divided protecting the nerve under direct visualization.  Distally, the dissection was carried between the 2 heads of the FCU.  Decompression of the nerve was performed between the heads of the FCU.  The muscular branches were well protected.  Similarly, the cutaneous branches in the arm and forearm were well protected.  The venous plexus proximally and distally were well protected.  The nerve was well mobilized from the cubital tunnel preserving the small longitudinal vessels accompanying it.  Proximally, multiple vascular leashes were defined near the incision of the septum into the medial epicondyle, which were also protected.  Once the in situ decompression of the ulnar nerve was performed proximally and distally, the elbow was flexed and extended.  There was no evidence of any subluxation.  Satisfactory decompression was performed.  Tourniquet was released.  Hemostasis was achieved.  Subcutaneous layer was closed with 2-0 Vicryl and skin was approximated with staples.  A well-padded dressing was applied.  The patient was then extubated and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  There were no intraoperative complications noted.  The patient tolerated the procedure very well.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after your surgery?
[patient] hi, i’m feeling a bit sore but okay overall.
[doctor] that’s expected. so, during the surgery, we confirmed that you had left cubital tunnel syndrome and ulnar nerve entrapment. we performed a decompression of the ulnar nerve in your left elbow. the ulnar nerve was significantly constricted as it passed through the cubital tunnel, and there was an hourglass constriction of the ulnar nerve.
[patient] okay, what does that mean?
[doctor] it means that the ulnar nerve was compressed and causing your symptoms. we were able to relieve that pressure by carefully dissecting and releasing the structures around the nerve. we also protected the muscular and cutaneous branches of the nerve, as well as the venous plexus, while performing the decompression.
[patient] i see.
[doctor] we used general anesthesia during the surgery, and once the procedure was complete, we closed the incision with staples and applied a well-padded dressing. you tolerated the procedure well, and there were no complications during or after the surgery.
[patient] okay, that sounds good. what should i expect during my recovery?
[doctor] you will need to keep your arm elevated and avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activity for a few weeks. you may also need to attend physical therapy to help regain strength and mobility in your arm. we will schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to check on your progress and make sure you are healing well.
[patient] alright doctor, thank you for explaining everything to me.","[doctor] hey, how you feeling after your surgery?

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Open angle glaucoma OX,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Open angle glaucoma OX,PROCEDURE:
Ahmed valve model S2 implant with pericardial reinforcement XXX eye,INDICATIONS:
This is a XX-year-old (wo)man with glaucoma in the OX eye, uncontrolled by maximum tolerated medical therapy.
PROCEDURE:
The risks and benefits of glaucoma surgery were discussed at length with the patient including bleeding, infection, reoperation, retinal detachment, diplopia, ptosis, loss of vision, and loss of the eye, corneal hemorrhage, hypotony, elevated pressure, worsening of glaucoma, and corneal edema. Informed consent was obtained. Patient received several sets of drops in his/her XXX eye including Ocuflox and Ocular. (S)He was taken to the operating room where monitored anesthetic care was initiated. Retrobulbar anesthesia was then administered to the XXX eye using a 50:50 mixture of 2% plain lidocaine and 0.05% Marcaine. The XXX eye was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile ophthalmic fashion. A speculum was placed on the eyelids and microscope was brought into position. A #7-0 Vicryl suture was passed through the superotemporal limbus and traction suture was placed at the superotemporal limbus and the eye was rotated infranasally so as to expose the superotemporal conjunctiva. At this point, smooth forceps and Westcott scissors were used to create a 100-degree superotemporal conjunctival peritomy, approximately 2 mm posterior to the superotemporal limbus. This was then dissected anteriorly to the limbus edge and then posteriorly. Steven scissors were then dissected in a superotemporal quadrant between the superior and lateral rectus muscles to provide good exposure. At this point, we primed the Ahmed valve with a #27 gauge cannula using BSS and it was noted to be patent. We then placed Ahmed valve in the superotemporal subconjunctival recess underneath the subtenon space and this was pushed posteriorly. We then measured with calipers so that it was positioned 9 mm posterior to the limbus. The Ahmed valve was then tacked down with #8-0 nylon suture through both fenestrations. We then applied light cautery to the superotemporal episcleral bed. We placed a paracentesis at the temporal position and inflated the anterior chamber with a small amount of Healon. We then used a #23 gauge needle and entered the superotemporal sclera, approximately 1 mm posterior to the limbus into the anterior chamber away from iris and away from cornea. We then trimmed the tube, beveled up in a 30 degree fashion with Vannas scissors, and introduced the tube through the #23 gauge tract into the anterior chamber so that approximately 2-3 mm of tube was extending into the anterior chamber. We burped some of the Healon out of the anterior chamber and filled it with BSS and we felt that the tube was in good position away from the lens, away from the cornea, and away from the iris. We then tacked down the tubes to the sclera with #8-0 Vicryl suture in a figure-of- eight fashion. The pericardium was soaked in gentamicin. We then folded the pericardium 1x1 cm piece onto itself and then placed it over the tube and this was tacked down in all four quadrants to the sclera with #8-0 nylon suture. At this point, we then re-approximated the conjunctiva to its original position and we closed it with an #8-0 Vicryl suture on a TG needle in a running fashion with interrupted locking bites. We then removed the traction suture. At the end of the case, the pupil was round, the chamber was deep, the tube appeared to be well positioned. The remaining portion of the Healon was burped out of the anterior chamber with BSS and the pressure was felt to be adequate. The speculum was removed. Ocuflox and Maxitrol ointment were placed over the eye. Then, an eye patch and shield were placed over the eye. The patient was awakened and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after your glaucoma surgery?

Under general anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in the usual manner.  Manipulating probe placed on the cervix, changed gloves.  Small cervical stab incision was made, Veress needle was inserted without problem.  A 3 L of carbon dioxide was insufflated.  The incision was enlarged.  A 5-mm trocar placed through the incision without problem.  Laparoscope placed through the trocar.  Pelvic contents visualized.  A 2nd puncture was made 2 fingerbreadths above the symphysis pubis in the midline.  Under direct vision, the trocar was placed in the abdominal cavity.  Uterus, tubes, and ovaries were all normal.  There were no pelvic adhesions, no evidence of endometriosis.  Uterus was anteverted and the right adnexa was placed on a stretch.  The tube was grasped 1 cm from the cornual region, care being taken to have the bipolar forceps completely across the tube and the tube was coagulated using amp meter for total desiccation.  The tube was grasped again and the procedure was repeated for a separate coagulation, so that 1.5 cm of the tube was coagulated.  The structure was confirmed to be tube by looking at fimbriated end.  The left adnexa was then placed on a stretch and the procedure was repeated again grasping the tube 1 cm from the cornual region and coagulating it.  Under traction, the amp meter was grasped 3 more times so that a total of 1.5 cm of tube was coagulated again.  Tube was confirmed by fimbriated end.  Gas was lend out of the abdomen.  Both punctures repaired with 4-0 Vicryl and punctures were injected with 0.5% Marcaine 10 mL.  The patient went to the recovery room in good condition.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after your procedure?

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Low Back Syndrome - Low back pain with left greater than right lower extremity radiculopathy.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Same.
PROCEDURE:
1.  Nerve root decompression at L45 on the left side.
2.  Tun-L catheter placement with injection of steroid solution and Marcaine at L45 nerve roots left.
3.  Interpretation of radiograph.
ANESTHESIA:
IV sedation with Versed and Fentanyl.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
None.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE:
Severe and excruciating pain in the lumbar spine and lower extremity.  MRI shows disc pathology as well as facet arthrosis.
SUMMARY OF PROCEDURE:
The patient was admitted to the operating room, consent was obtained and signed.  The patient was taken to the Operating room and was placed in the prone position.  Monitors were placed, including EKG, pulse oximeter and blood pressure monitoring.  After adequate IV sedation with Versed and Fentanyl the procedure was begun.
The lumbar sacral region was prepped and draped in sterile fashion with Betadine and four sterile towels.  After the towels were places then sterile drapes were placed on top of that.
After which time the Epimed catheter was then placed, this was done by first repositioning the C-Arm to visualize the lumbar spine and the vertebral bodies were then counted beginning at L5, verifying the sacral hiatus.  The skin over the sacral hiatus was then injected with 1% Lidocaine and an #18-gauge needle was used for skin puncture.  The #18-gauge needle was inserted off of midline.  A #16-gauge RK needle was then placed into the skin puncture and using the paramedian approach and loss-of-resistance technique the needle was placed.  Negative aspiration was carefully performed.  Omnipaque 240 dye was then injected through the #16-gauge RK needle.  The classical run off was noted.  A filling defect was noted @ L45 nerve root on the left side.  After which time 10 cc of 0.25% Marcaine/Triamcinolone (9/1 mixture) was then infused through the 16 R-K Needle.  Some additional lyses of adhesions were visualized as the local anesthetic displaced the Omnipaque 240 dye using this barbotage technique.
An Epimed Tun-L catheter was then inserted through the #16-gauage R-K needle and threaded up to the L45 interspace under continuous fluoroscopic guidance.  As the catheter was threaded up under continuous fluoroscopic visualization lyses of adhesions were visualized.  The tip of the catheter was noted to be @ L45 level on the left side.  After this the #16-gauge RK needle was then removed under fluoroscopic guidance verifying that the tip of the catheter did not migrate from the L45 nerve root region on the left side.  After this was successfully done, the catheter was then secured in place; this was done with Neosporin ointment, a Split 2x2, Op site and Hypofix tape.  The catheter was then checked with negative aspiration and the Omnipaque 240 dye was then injected.  The classical run off was noted in the lumbar region.  Some lyses of adhesions were also visualized at this time with barbotage technique.  Good dye spread was noted to extend one level above and one level below the L45 nerve root and bilateral spread was noted.  Nerve root decompression was visualized as dye spread into the nerve root whereas prior this was a filling defect.  After which time negative aspiration was again performed through the Epimed® Tun-L catheter and then 10 cc of solution was then infused through the catheter, this was done over a 10-minute period with initial 3 cc test dose.  Approximately 3 minutes elapsed and then the remaining 7 cc were infused (Solution consisting of 8 cc of 0.25% Marcaine, 2 cc of Triamcinolone and 1 cc of Wydase.)  The catheter was then capped with a bacterial filter.  The patient was noted to have tolerated the procedure well without any complications.
Interpretation of radiograph revealed nerve root adhesions present with lysis of these adhesions as the procedure was performed.  A filling defect was seen at the L45 nerve root and this filling defect being significant of fibrosis and adhesions in this region was noted to be lysed with the insertion of the catheter as well as the barbotage procedure.  This verified positive nerve root decompression.  The tip of the Epimed Tun L catheter was noted to be at L45 level on the left side.  Positive myelogram without dural puncture was noted during this procedure; no sub-dural spread of Omnipaque 240 dye was noted.  This patient did not report any problems and reported pain reduction.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling after your procedure?
[patient] hi doctor, i'm feeling much better. the pain has been reduced.
[doctor] that's great to hear. can you tell me how the procedure went from your perspective?
[patient] they took me to the operating room and i was given some medication to help me relax. then, they placed me in the prone position and prepped and draped the lumbar sacral region in sterile fashion. after that, they put in the epimed catheter and injected some lidocaine, then a needle was inserted with the paramedian approach and loss-of-resistance technique. they injected omnipaque 240 dye, and a filling defect was noted at l45 nerve root on the left side. then, 10cc of 0.25% marcaine/triamcinolone was infused through the needle, and an epimed tun-l catheter was inserted through the needle and threaded up to the l45 interspace under continuous fluoroscopic guidance. they secured the catheter in place and checked with negative aspiration, then 10cc of solution was infused through the catheter over a 10-minute period. finally, the catheter was capped with a bacterial filter.
[doctor] thank you for the detailed explanation. how do you feel now compared to before the procedure?
[patient] the pain in my lumbar spine and lower extremity has been reduced. i'm feeling much better.
[doctor] that's great. additionally, the interpretation of radiograph revealed nerve root adhesions present with lysis of these adhesions as the procedure was performed. can you tell me a bit about how you feel about that?
[patient] i'm glad that the adhesions were lysed during the procedure. it is a relief to know that those were taken care of.
[doctor] excellent. the procedure went well and everything appears to have been successful. please come back if you have any further issues.","[doctor] hey there, how ya feeling after your procedure?
[patient] um, hi doctor, feeling much better. the pain's gone down a bit.
[doctor] oh, that's great. so, how'd it go for you?
[patient] well, they took me to the operating room and gave me some medication to relax. then, they had me lying down on my belly, and covered up my lumbar sacral region with sterile stuff. after that, they put in the epimed catheter and injected some lidocaine, and then they stuck a needle in with the paramedian approach and loss-of-resistance technique. then, they shot some omnipaque 240 dye in, and saw that there was a filling defect at l45 nerve root on the left side. they pumped in 10cc of 0.25% marcaine/triamcinolone through the needle, and then an epimed tun-l catheter was inserted through the needle and threaded up to the l45 interspace under continuous fluoroscopic guidance. they secured the catheter in place and checked with negative aspiration, then pumped 10cc of solution through the catheter over a 10-minute period. finally, they capped the catheter with a bacterial filter.
[doctor] wow, thanks for the detailed update. so how do you feel now, compared to before?
[patient] the pain in my lumbar spine and lower extremity has been reduced. i'm feeling much better.
[doctor] that's good news. also, we saw in the radiograph that there were some nerve root adhesions present, but the adhesions were lysed as the procedure was performed. how do you feel about that?
[patient] i'm just relieved that the adhesions were taken care of during the procedure. it's a weight off my shoulders.
[doctor] excellent. everything seems to have gone well and i'm glad you're feeling better. if anything else comes up, don't hesitate to come back in.",1
"DIAGNOSIS:
Multiparous female, desires permanent sterilization.
NAME OF OPERATION:
Laparoscopic bilateral tubal ligation with Falope rings.
ANESTHESIA:
General, ET tube.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
FINDINGS:
Normal female anatomy except for mild clitoromegaly and a posterior uterine fibroid.
PROCEDURE:
The patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the table in the supine position.  After adequate general anesthesia was obtained, she was placed in the lithotomy position and examined.  She was found to have an anteverted uterus and no adnexal mass.  She was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  The Foley catheter was placed.  A Hulka cannula was inserted into the cervix and attached to the anterior lip of the cervix.
An infraumbilical incision was made with the knife.  A Veress needle was inserted into the abdomen.  Intraperitoneal location was verified with approximately 10 cc of sterile solution.  A pneumoperitoneum was created.  The Veress needle was then removed, and a trocar was inserted directly without difficulty.  Intraperitoneal location was verified visually with the laparoscope.  There was no evidence of any intra-abdominal trauma.
Each fallopian tube was elevated with a Falope ring applicator, and a Falope ring was placed on each tube with a 1-cm to 1.5-cm portion of the tube above the Falope ring.
The pneumoperitoneum was evacuated, and the trocar was removed under direct visualization.  An attempt was made to close the fascia with a figure-of-eight suture.  However, this was felt to be more subcutaneous.  The skin was closed in a subcuticular fashion, and the patient was taken to the recovery room awake with vital signs stable.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after your laparoscopic bilateral tubal ligation with falope rings?
[patient] hi, i'm feeling okay, just a little sore.
[doctor] that's understandable. can you tell me a little bit about what led you to choose this procedure?
[patient] yes, i'm a multiparous female and i was looking for a permanent method of sterilization.
[doctor] okay, that makes sense. during the procedure, we found normal female anatomy except for mild clitoromegaly and a posterior uterine fibroid. the procedure itself went smoothly and we did not encounter any complications.
[patient] that's good to hear.
[doctor] we used general anesthesia with an et tube and an infraumbilical incision was made. after inserting a hulka cannula into the cervix, we used a veress needle to create a pneumoperitoneum and inserted a trocar into the abdomen. we elevated each fallopian tube with a falope ring applicator and placed a falope ring on each tube, leaving a small portion of the tube above the ring. we then closed the skin in a subcuticular fashion and monitored you in the recovery room until you were awake and stable.
[patient] thank you for explaining that to me.
[doctor] of course. do you have any questions or concerns?
[patient] no, i think i understand everything. thank you for taking care of me.
[doctor] you're welcome. if you have any issues or concerns in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after your laparoscopic bilateral tubal ligation with falope rings?

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Foraminal disc herniation of left L3-L4.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Foraminal disc herniation of left L3-L4.
2.  Enlarged dorsal root ganglia of the left L3 nerve root.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
Transpedicular decompression of the left L3-L4 with discectomy.
ANESTHESIA:
General.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
Minimal.
SPECIMEN:
None.
HISTORY:
This is a 55-year-old female with a four-month history of left thigh pain.  An MRI of the lumbar spine has demonstrated a mass in the left L3 foramen displacing the nerve root, which appears to be a foraminal disc herniation effacing the L3 nerve root.  Upon exploration of the nerve root, it appears that there was a small disc herniation in the foramen, but more impressive was the abnormal size of the dorsal root ganglia that was enlarged more medially than laterally.  There was no erosion into the bone surrounding the area rather in the pedicle above or below or into the vertebral body, so otherwise the surrounding anatomy is normal.  I was prepared to do a discectomy and had not consented the patient for a biopsy of the nerve root.  But because of the sequela of cutting into a nerve root with residual weakness and persistent pain that the patient would suffer, at this point I was not able to perform this biopsy without prior consent from the patient.  So, surgery ended decompressing the L3 foramen and providing a discectomy with idea that we will obtain contrasted MRIs in the near future and I will discuss the findings with the patient and make further recommendations.
OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:
The patient was taken to OR #5 at ABCD General Hospital in a gurney.  Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic.  Endotracheal intubation followed.  The patient received the Foley catheter.  She was then placed in a prone position on a Jackson table.  Bony prominences were well padded.  Localizing x-rays were obtained at this time and the back was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A midline incision was made over the L3-L4 disc space taking through subcutaneous tissues sharply, dissection was then carried out to the left of the midline with lumbodorsal fascia incised and the musculature was elevated in a supraperiosteal fashion from the level of L3.  Retractors were placed into the wound to retract the musculature.  At this point, the pars interarticularis was identified and the facet joint of L2-L3 was identified.  A marker was placed over the pedicle of L3 and confirmed radiographically.  Next, a microscope was brought onto the field.  The remainder of the procedure was noted with microscopic visualization.  A high-speed drill was used to remove the small portions of the lateral aspects of the pars interarticularis.  At this point, soft tissue was removed with a Kerrison rongeur and the nerve root was clearly identified in the foramen.  As the disc space of L3-L4 is identified, there is a small prominence of the disc, but not as impressive as I would expect on the MRI.  A discectomy was performed at this time removing only small portions of the lateral aspect of the disc.  Next, the nerve root was clearly dissected out and visualized, the lateral aspect of the nerve root appears to be normal in structural appearance.  The medial aspect with the axilla of the nerve root appears to be enlarged.  The color of the tissue was consistent with a nerve root tissue.  There was no identifiable plane and this is a gentle enlargement of the nerve root.  There are no circumscribed lesions or masses that can easily be separated from the nerve root.  As I described in the initial paragraph, since I was not prepared to perform a biopsy on the nerve and the patient had not been consented, I do not think it is reasonable to take the patient to this procedure, because she will have persistent weakness and pain in the leg following this procedure.  So, at this point there is no further decompression.  A nerve fork was passed both ventral and dorsal to the nerve root and there was no compression for lateral.  The pedicle was palpated inferiorly and medially and there was no compression, as the nerve root can be easily moved medially.  The wound was then irrigated copiously and suctioned dry.  A concoction of Duramorph and ______ was then placed over the nerve root for pain control.  The retractors were removed at this point.  The fascia was reapproximated with #1 Vicryl sutures, subcutaneous tissues with #2 Vicryl sutures, and Steri-Strips covering the incision.  The patient transferred to the hospital gurney, extubated by Anesthesia, and subsequently transferred to Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling?
[patient] i'm feeling alright, a little sore though.
[doctor] that's understandable, you just had surgery. can you tell me a bit about your symptoms leading up to surgery?
[patient] i had left thigh pain for about 4 months and an mri showed a mass in the left l3 foramen that was a disc herniation.
[doctor] yes, during the surgery, we performed a transpedicular decompression of the left l3-l4 with discectomy. we also identified an enlarged dorsal root ganglia of your left l3 nerve root. while we were prepared to do a biopsy of the nerve root, we didn't have prior consent from you and didn't want to risk any residual weakness or pain. we were able to decompress the l3 foramen and perform a discectomy. 
[patient] okay, and what are the next steps?
[doctor] we'll be obtaining contrasted mris in the near future and i'll discuss the findings with you and make further recommendations. in the meantime, we've done what we can to relieve the pressure and pain in the area. the wound was irrigated, and we placed a concoction of duramorph and ______ over the nerve root for pain control. you will need to take it easy for a bit, but i don't anticipate any complications. we'll follow up with you for further treatment recommendations.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling?

3.  Acute pancreatitis.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Hyperpyrexia/leukocytosis.
2.  Ventilator-dependent respiratory failure.
3.  Acute pancreatitis.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
1.  Insertion of a right brachial artery arterial catheter.
2.  Insertion of a right subclavian vein triple lumen catheter.
ANESTHESIA:
Local, 1% lidocaine.
BLOOD LOSS:
Less than 5 cc.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
INDICATIONS:
The patient is a 46-year-old Caucasian female admitted with severe pancreatitis.  She was severely dehydrated and necessitated some fluid boluses.  The patient became hypotensive, required many fluid boluses, became very anasarcic and had difficulty with breathing and became hypoxic.  She required intubation and has been ventilator-dependent in the Intensive Care since that time.  The patient developed very high temperatures as well as leukocytosis.  Her lines required being changed.
PROCEDURE:
1.  RIGHT BRACHIAL ARTERIAL LINE:
The patient's right arm was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  There was a good brachial pulse palpated.  The artery was cannulated with the provided needle and the kit.  There was good arterial blood return noted immediately.  On the first stick, the Seldinger wire was inserted through the needle to cannulate the right brachial artery without difficulty.  The needle was removed and a catheter was inserted over the Seldinger wire to cannulate the brachial artery.  The femoral catheter was used in this case secondary to the patient's severe edema and anasarca.  We did not feel that the shorter catheter would provide enough length.  The catheter was connected to the system and flushed without difficulty.  A good waveform was noted.  The catheter was sutured into place with #3-0 silk suture and OpSite dressing was placed over this.
2.  RIGHT SUBCLAVIAN TRIPLE LUMEN CATHETER:
The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  1% Xylocaine was used to anesthetize an area just inferior and lateral to the angle of the clavicle.  Using the anesthetic needle, we checked down to the soft tissues anesthetizing, as we proceeded to the angle of the clavicle, this was also anesthetized.  Next, a #18 gauge thin walled needle was used following the same track to the angle of clavicle.  We roughed the needle down off the clavicle and directed it towards the sternal notch.  There was good venous return noted immediately.  The syringe was removed and a Seldinger guidewire was inserted through the needle to cannulate the vein.  The needle was then removed.  A small skin nick was made with a #11 blade scalpel and the provided dilator was used to dilate the skin, soft tissue and vein.  Next, the triple lumen catheter was inserted over the guidewire without difficulty.  The guidewire was removed.  All the ports aspirated and flushed without difficulty.  The catheter was sutured into place with #3-0 silk suture and a sterile OpSite dressing was also applied.  The patient tolerated the above procedures well.  A chest x-ray has been ordered, however, it has not been completed at this time, this will be checked and documented in the progress notes.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i am doing okay, doctor.
[doctor] that's good to hear. so, i see that you had a couple of procedures yesterday. how did those go?
[patient] they went fine. i had an arterial catheter inserted into my right arm, and a triple lumen catheter was inserted into my right subclavian vein.
[doctor] okay. were you given any anesthesia for the procedures?
[patient] yes, i was given local anesthesia using 1% lidocaine.
[doctor] that's good. did you experience any complications during or after the procedures?
[patient] no, i did not experience any complications.
[doctor] great. so, the reason why we had to insert these catheters was because of your severe pancreatitis, which caused you to become severely dehydrated and necessitated some fluid boluses. then, you became hypotensive and needed many more fluid boluses, and you also developed anasarca and had difficulty breathing. that's why you were intubated and have been on a ventilator in the icu since then. you also developed very high temperatures as well as leukocytosis, which required us to change your lines.
[patient] yes, that's correct.
[doctor] alright. well, the procedures went well, and your catheters are properly sutured and dressed. we have ordered a chest x-ray to check everything, but it hasn't been completed yet. is there anything else you'd like to talk to me about?

Need for intravenous access.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
Insertion of a right femoral triple lumen catheter.
ANESTHESIA:
Includes 4 cc of 1% lidocaine locally.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
Minimum.
INDICATIONS:
The patient is an 86-year-old Caucasian female who presented to ABCD General Hospital secondary to drainage of an old percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy site.  The patient is also ventilator-dependent, respiratory failure with tracheostomy in place and dependent on parenteral nutrition secondary to dysphagia and also has history of protein-calorie malnutrition and the patient needs to receive total parenteral nutrition and therefore needs central venous access.
PROCEDURE:
The patient's legal guardian was talked to.  All questions were answered and consent was obtained.  The patient was sterilely prepped and draped.  Approximately 4 cc of 1% lidocaine was injected into the inguinal site.  A strong femoral artery pulse was felt and triple lumen catheter Angiocath was inserted at 30-degree angle cephalad and aspirated until a dark venous blood was aspirated.  A guidewire was then placed through the needle.  The needle was then removed.  The skin was ________ at the base of the wire and a dilator was placed over the wire.  The triple lumen catheters were then flushed with bacteriostatic saline.  The dilator was then removed from the guidewire and a triple lumen catheter was then inserted over the guidewire with the guidewire held at all times.
The wire was then carefully removed.  Each port of the lumen catheter was aspirated with 10 cc syringe with normal saline till dark red blood was expressed and then flushed with bacteriostatic normal saline and repeated on the remaining two ports.  Each port was closed off and also kept off.  Straight needle suture was then used to suture the triple lumen catheter down to the skin.  Peristatic agent was then placed at the site of the lumen catheter insertion and a Tegaderm was then placed over the site.  The surgical site was then sterilely cleaned.  The patient tolerated the full procedure well.  There were no complications.  The nurse was then contacted to allow for access of the triple lumen catheter.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] i'm doing okay, a little sore at the insertion site.

"PROCEDURE:
Trigger finger release.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After administering appropriate antibiotics and MAC anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion.  The arm was exsanguinated with Esmarch, and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg.
A longitudinal incision was made over the digit's A1 pulley.  Dissection was carried down to the flexor sheath with care taken to identify and protect the neurovascular bundles.  The sheath was opened under direct vision with a scalpel, and then a scissor was used to release it under direct vision from the proximal extent of the A1 pulley to just proximal to the proximal digital crease.  Meticulous hemostasis was maintained with bipolar electrocautery.
The tendons were identified and atraumatically pulled to ensure that no triggering remained.  The patient then actively moved the digit, and no triggering was noted.
After irrigating out the wound with copious amounts of sterile saline, the skin was closed with 5-0 nylon simple interrupted sutures.
The wound was dressed and the patient was sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the trigger finger release procedure?

After administering appropriate antibiotics and MAC anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The arm was exsanguinated with Esmarch, and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg.
A transverse incision was made over the MPJ crease of the thumb.  Dissection was carried down to the flexor sheath with care taken to identify and protect the neurovascular bundles.  The flexor sheath was opened under direct vision with a scalpel, and then a scissor was used to release the A1 pulley under direct vision on the radial side, from its proximal extent to its distal extent at the junction of the proximal and middle thirds of the proximal phalanx.  Meticulous hemostasis was maintained with bipolar electrocautery.
The flexor pollicis longus tendon was identified and atraumatically pulled to ensure that no triggering remained.  The patient then actively moved the thumb and no triggering was noted.
After irrigating out the wound with copious amounts of sterile saline, the skin was closed with 5-0 nylon simple interrupted sutures.
The wound was dressed and the patient was sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after your trigger thumb release procedure?
[patient] hi, doctor. i'm feeling okay, a little sore but doing alright.
[doctor] that's understandable. i just wanted to go over some details of the procedure with you. so, we administered antibiotics and anesthesia, and then prepped and draped your arm in a sterile fashion.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] after that, we made a transverse incision over the mpj crease of your thumb and carefully identified and protected the neurovascular bundles as we opened up the flexor sheath. we released the a1 pulley and made sure to maintain meticulous hemostasis with bipolar electrocautery.
[patient] i see.
[doctor] we then identified and pulled the flexor pollicis longus tendon to make sure there was no triggering left. after irrigating the wound, we closed it with sutures.
[patient] alright.
[doctor] you should know that you tolerated the procedure very well and are now in good condition. do you have any questions or concerns about the procedure?
[patient] no, not really. just when can i expect to use my thumb again?
[doctor] you can start moving your thumb immediately, but i would advise against any strenuous activity or heavy lifting for a few weeks. we'll have you come back for a follow-up appointment to make sure everything is healing properly.
[patient] okay, sounds good. thank you, doctor.
[doctor] you're welcome. don't hesitate to call if you have any issues or concerns.","[doctor] hey there! how's it going after your trigger thumb release procedure?
[patient] hey doc! i'm feeling alright, just a little sore.
[doctor] ah, gotcha. so, i just wanted to go over some details of the procedure with you. we gave you antibiotics and anesthesia first, and then we prepped and draped your arm all sterile-like.
[patient] mm-hmm.
[doctor] then, we made a transverse incision over the mpj crease of your thumb and were really careful to protect the neurovascular bundles as we opened up the flexor sheath. we released the a1 pulley and made sure to keep things nice and clean with bipolar electrocautery.
[patient] right, right.
[doctor] after that, we identified and pulled the flexor pollicis longus tendon to make sure there was no triggering left before closing the wound with sutures.
[patient] got it.
[doctor] you did great during the procedure and now you're in good shape. do you have any questions or concerns about it?
[patient] um, not really. i'm just wondering when i can start using my thumb again.
[doctor] you can start moving it right away, but be careful with any heavy lifting or strenuous activity for a few weeks. we'll have you come back for a follow-up appointment to make sure you're healing up nicely.
[patient] okay, sounds good. thanks, doc!
[doctor] you're welcome! if you have any problems or questions, don't hesitate to give us a call.",1
"INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:
Impending open heart surgery for closure of ventricular septal defect in a 4-month-old girl.
Procedures were done under general anesthesia.  The patient was already in the operating room under general anesthesia.  Antibiotic prophylaxis with cefazolin and gentamicin was already given prior to beginning the procedures.
PROCEDURE #1:
Insertion of transesophageal echocardiography probe.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE #1:
The probe was well lubricated and with digital manipulation, was passed into the esophagus without resistance.  The probe was placed so that the larger diameter was in the anterior-posterior position during insertion.  The probe was used by the pediatric cardiologist for preoperative and postoperative diagnostic echocardiography.  At the end, it was removed without trauma and there was no blood tingeing.  It is to be noted that approximately 30 minutes after removing the cannula, I inserted a 14-French suction tube to empty the stomach and there were a few mL of blood secretions that were suctioned.  There was no overt bleeding.
PROCEDURE #2:
Attempted and unsuccessful insertion of arterial venous lines.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE #2:
Both groins were prepped and draped.  The patient was placed at 10 degrees head-up position.  A Cook 4-French double-lumen 8-cm catheter kit was opened.  Using the 21-gauge needle that comes with the kit, several attempts were made to insert central venous and then an arterial line in the left groin.  There were several successful punctures of these vessels, but I was unable to advance Seldinger wire.  After removal of the needles, the area was compressed digitally for approximately 5 minutes.  There was a small hematoma that was not growing.  Initially, the left leg was mildly mottled with prolonged capillary refill of approximately 3 seconds.  Using 1% lidocaine, I infiltrated the vessels of the groin both medial and lateral to the vascular sheath.  Further observation, the capillary refill and circulation of the left leg became more than adequate.  The O2 saturation monitor that was on the left toe functioned well throughout the procedures, from the beginning to the end.  At the end of the procedure, the circulation of the leg was intact.
","[doctor] hi, how are you doing today?
[patient] hi, i'm doing fine, thank you.
[doctor] great. i'm here to discuss the recent procedures that were done for your 4-month-old daughter. as you know, we had to perform open-heart surgery to close her ventricular septal defect.
[patient] yes, i remember.
[doctor] during the surgery, we also inserted a transesophageal echocardiography probe to aid in the diagnostic process before and after surgery. the probe was passed into the esophagus without any resistance and was removed without any issues. however, after removing the cannula, i inserted a suction tube to empty the stomach, and there were a few milliliters of blood secretions that were suctioned. but there was no overt bleeding.
[patient] i see.
[doctor] we also attempted to insert arterial venous lines through both groins, but it was unsuccessful. i was unable to advance the seldinger wire after several successful punctures of the vessels. after the removal of needles, the area was compressed digitally for about five minutes. there was a small hematoma, but it was not growing. i used 1% lidocaine to infiltrate the vessels of the groin, and the circulation of the left leg became more than adequate. the o2 saturation monitor on the left toe functioned well throughout the procedures, from the beginning to the end. at the end of the procedure, the circulation of the leg was intact.
[patient] okay, thank you for letting me know.
[doctor] of course. is there anything else you want to ask or any concerns you have?
[patient] no, not at the moment. thank you for your time and for explaining everything to me.
[doctor] you're welcome. if you have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to reach out.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] um, hi. i'm doing fine, thank you.
[doctor] oh good! so, i wanted to chat with you about the procedures we did for your daughter. you remember the open-heart surgery to close her ventricular septal defect, right?
[patient] oh yeah, i remember.
[doctor] during the surgery, we used a transesophageal echocardiography probe to help with the diagnostic process. we didn't have any issues inserting or removing it, but when we removed the cannula, we suctioned a few milliliters of blood secretions from the stomach. but don't worry, we didn't see any obvious bleeding.
[patient] mm-hmm, got it.
[doctor] we also tried to insert arterial venous lines through both groins, but it didn't work out. i had trouble advancing the seldinger wire after a few successful punctures of the vessels. after i took out the needles, i applied digital pressure to the area for about five minutes. there was a small hematoma, but it wasn't growing. i used 1% lidocaine to numb the vessels of the groin, and the circulation of the left leg improved. the o2 saturation monitor on the left toe worked well throughout the procedures. and at the end of the procedure, the circulation of the leg was intact.
[patient] okay, thank you for letting me know.
[doctor] no problem! do you have any other questions or concerns you wanna chat about?
[patient] no, not at the moment. thank you for your time and for explaining everything to me.
[doctor] you're welcome! if you think of anything later on, just give me a holler.",1
"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Respiratory failure.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Respiratory failure.
OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:
Tracheotomy.
ANESTHESIA:
General inhalational.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
The patient was taken to the operating room, placed supine on the operating table.  General inhalational anesthesia was administered through the patient's existing 4.0 endotracheal tube.  The neck was extended and secured with tape and incision in the midline of the neck approximately 2 fingerbreadths above the sternal notch was outlined.  The incision measured approximately 1 cm and was just below the palpable cricoid cartilage and first tracheal ring.  The incision area was infiltrated with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine 1:100,000.  A #67 blade was used to perform the incision.  Electrocautery was used to remove excess fat tissue to expose the strap muscles.  The strap muscles were grasped and divided in the midline with a cutting electrocautery.  Sharp dissection was used to expose the anterior trachea and cricoid cartilage.  The thyroid isthmus was identified crossing just below the cricoid cartilage.  This was divided in the midline with electrocautery.  Blunt dissection was used to expose adequate cartilaginous rings.  A 4.0 silk was used for stay sutures to the midline of the cricoid.  Additional stay sutures were placed on each side of the third tracheal ring.  Thin DuoDerm was placed around the stoma.  The tracheal incision was performed with a #11 blade through the second, third, and fourth tracheal rings.  The cartilaginous edges were secured to the skin edges with interrupted #4-0 Monocryl.  A 4.5 PED tight-to-shaft cuffed Bivona tube was placed and secured with Velcro ties.  A flexible scope was passed through the tracheotomy tube.  The carina was visualized approximately 1.5 cm distal to the distal end of the tracheotomy tube.  Ventilation was confirmed.  There was good chest rise and no appreciable leak.  The procedure was terminated.  The patient was in stable condition.  Bleeding was negligible and she was transferred back to the Pediatric intensive care unit in stable condition.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling?
[patient] i'm feeling okay.
[doctor] good to hear. so, the reason we're having this conversation is because you had a procedure done. can you tell me how you're feeling after that?

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Ventilator-dependent respiratory failure.
2.  Multiple strokes.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Ventilator-dependent respiratory failure.
2.  Multiple strokes.
PROCEDURES PERFORMED:
1.  Tracheostomy.
2.  Thyroid isthmusectomy.
ANESTHESIA:
General endotracheal tube.
BLOOD LOSS:
Minimal, less than 25 cc.
INDICATIONS:
The patient is a 50-year-old gentleman who presented to the Emergency Department who had had multiple massive strokes.  He had required ventilator assistance and was transported to the ICU setting.  Because of the numerous deficits from the stroke, he is expected to have a prolonged ventilatory course and he will be requiring long-term care.
PROCEDURE:
After all risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with multiple family members in detail, informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the Operative Suite where he was placed in supine position and general anesthesia was delivered through the existing endotracheal tube.  The neck was then palpated and marked appropriately in the cricoid cartilage sternal notch and thyroid cartilage marked appropriately with felt-tip marker.  The skin was then anesthetized with a mixture of 1% lidocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine solution.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual fashion.  The surgeons were gowned and gloved.  A vertical skin incision was then made with a #15 blade scalpel extending from approximately two fingerbreadths above the level of the sternum approximately 1 cm above the cricoid cartilage.  Blunt dissection was then carried down until the fascia overlying the strap muscles were identified.  At this point, the midline raphe was identified and the strap muscles were separated utilizing the Bovie cautery.  Once the strap muscles have been identified, palpation was performed to identify any arterial aberration.  A high-riding innominate was not identified.  At this point, it was recognized that the thyroid gland was overlying the trachea could not be mobilized.  Therefore, dissection was carried down through to the cricoid cartilage at which point hemostat was advanced underneath the thyroid gland, which was then doubly clamped and ligated with Bovie cautery.  Suture ligation with #3-0 Vicryl was then performed on the thyroid gland in a double interlocking fashion.  This cleared a significant portion of the trachea.  The overlying pretracheal fascia was then cleared with use of pressured forceps as well as Bovie cautery.  Now, a tracheal hook was placed underneath the cricoid cartilage in order to stabilize the trachea.  The second tracheal ring was identified.  The Bovie cautery reduced to create a tracheal window beneath the second tracheal ring that was inferiorly based.  At this point, the anesthetist was appropriately alerted to deflate the endotracheal tube cuff.  The airway was entered and inferior to the base, window was created.  The anesthetist then withdrew the endotracheal tube until the tip of the tube was identified.  At this point, a #8 Shiley tracheostomy tube was inserted freely into the tracheal lumen.  The balloon was inflated and the ventilator was attached.  He was immediately noted to have return of the CO2 waveform and was ventilating appropriately according to the anesthetist.  Now, all surgical retractors were removed.  The baseplate of the tracheostomy tube was sutured to the patient's skin with #2-0 nylon suture.  The tube was further secured around the patient's neck with IV tubing.  Finally, a drain sponge was placed.  At this point, procedure was felt to be complete.  The patient was returned to the ICU setting in stable condition where a chest x-ray is pending.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling?
[patient] (unable to speak)

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Ventilator-dependent respiratory failure.
2.  Laryngeal edema.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Ventilator-dependent respiratory failure.
2.  Laryngeal edema.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
Tracheostomy change.  A #6 Shiley with proximal extension was changed to a #6 Shiley with proximal extension.
INDICATIONS:
The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian female who presented to ABCD General Hospital with exacerbation of COPD and CHF.  The patient had subsequently been taken to the operating room by Department of Otolaryngology and a direct laryngoscope was performed.  The patient was noted at that time to have transglottic edema.  Biopsies were taken.  At the time of surgery, it was decided that the patient required a tracheostomy for maintenance of continued ventilation and airway protection.  The patient is currently postop day #6 and appears to be unable to be weaned from ventilator at this time and may require prolonged ventricular support.  A decision was made to perform tracheostomy change.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
The patient was seen in the Intensive Care Unit.  The patient was placed in a supine position.  The neck was then extended.  The sutures that were previously in place in the #6 Shiley with proximal extension were removed.  The patient was preoxygenated to 100%.  After several minutes, the patient was noted to have a pulse oximetry of 100%.  The IV tubing that was supporting the patient's trache was then cut.  The tracheostomy tube was then suctioned.
The inner cannula was then removed from the tracheostomy and a nasogastric tube was placed down the lumen of the tracheostomy tube as a guidewire.  The tracheostomy tube was then removed over the nasogastric tube and the operative field was suctioned.  With the guidewire in place and with adequate visualization, a new #6 Shiley with proximal extension was then passed over the nasogastric tube guidewire and carefully inserted into the trachea.  The guidewire was then removed and the inner cannula was then placed into the tracheostomy.  The patient was then reconnected to the ventilator and was noted to have normal tidal volumes.  The patient had a tidal volume of 500 and was returning 500 cc to 510 cc.  The patient continued to saturate well with saturations 99%.  The patient appeared comfortable and her vital signs were stable.  A soft trache collar was then connected to the trachesotomy.  A drain sponge was then inserted underneath the new trache site.  The patient was observed for several minutes and was found to be in no distress and continued to maintain adequate saturations and continued to return normal tidal volumes.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
DISPOSITION:
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  0.25% acetic acid soaks were ordered to the drain sponge every shift.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?

"PROCEDURES:
Total knee replacement.
PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:
The patient was bought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  After induction of anesthesia, a tourniquet was placed on the upper thigh.  Sterile prepping and draping proceeded.  The tourniquet was inflated to 300 mmHg.  A midline incision was made, centered over the patella.  Dissection was sharply carried down through the subcutaneous tissues.  A median parapatellar arthrotomy was performed.  The lateral patellar retinacular ligaments were released and the patella was retracted laterally.  Proximal medial tibia was denuded, with mild release of medial soft tissues.  The ACL and PCL were released.  The medial and lateral menisci and suprapatellar fat pad were removed.  These releases allowed for anterior subluxation of tibia.  An extramedullary tibial cutting jig was pinned to the proximal tibia in the appropriate alignment and flush cut was made along tibial plateau, perpendicular to the axis of the tibia.  Its alignment was checked with the rod and found to be adequate.  The tibia was then allowed to relocate under the femur.
An intramedullary hole was drilled into the femur and a femoral rod attached to the anterior cutting block was inserted, and the block was pinned in appropriate position, judging correct rotation using a variety of techniques.  An anterior rough cut was made.  The distal cutting jig was placed atop this cut surface and pinned to the distal femur, and the rod was removed.  The distal cut was performed.
A spacer block was placed, and adequate balance in extension was adjusted and confirmed, as was knee alignment.  Femoral sizing was performed with the sizer, and the appropriate size femoral 4-in-1 chamfer-cutting block was pinned in place and the cuts were made.  The notch-cutting block was pinned to the cut surface, slightly laterally, and the notch cut was then made.  The trial femoral component was impacted onto the distal femur and found to have an excellent fit.  A trial tibial plate and polyethylene were inserted, and stability was judged and found to be adequate in all planes.  Appropriate rotation of the tibial component was identified and marked.  The trials were removed and the tibia was brought forward again.  The tibial plate size was checked and the plate was pinned to plateau.  A keel guide was placed and the keel was then made.  The femoral intramedullary hole was plugged with bone from the tibia.  The trial tibial component and poly placed; and, after placement of the femoral component, range of motion and stability were checked and found to be adequate in various ranges of flexion and extension.
The patella was held in a slightly everted position with knee in extension.  Patellar width was checked with calipers.  A free-hand cut of the patellar articular surface was performed and checked to ensure symmetry with the calipers.  Sizing was then performed and 3 lug holes were drilled with the jig in place, taking care to medialize and superiorize the component as much as possible, given bony anatomy.  Any excess lateral patellar bone was recessed.  The trial patellar component was placed and found to have adequate tracking.  The trials were removed; and as the cement was mixed, all cut surfaces were thoroughly washed and dried.  The cement was applied to the components and the cut surfaces with digital pressurization, and then the components were impacted.  The excess cement was removed from the gutters and anterior and posterior parts of the knee.  The knee was brought into full extension with the trial polyethylene and further axially pressurized as cement hardened.  Once the cement had hardened, the tourniquet was deflated.  The knee was dislocated again, and any excess cement was removed with an osteotome.  Thorough irrigation and hemostasis were performed.  The real polyethylene component was placed and pinned.  Further vigorous power irrigation was performed, and adequate hemostasis was obtained and confirmed.  The arthrotomy was closed using 0 Ethibond and Vicryl sutures.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed after further irrigation with 2-0 Vicryl and Monocryl sutures.  The skin was sealed with staples.  Xeroform and a sterile dressing were applied followed by a cold-pack and Ace wrap.  The patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition, having tolerated the procedure well.","[doctor]: hi, how are you feeling after the total knee replacement surgery? 

[patient]: hi, i'm feeling okay, just a bit sore. 

[doctor]: that's normal. can you tell me more about the procedure and how it went? 

[patient]: well, they put me to sleep and then placed a tourniquet on my upper thigh. after that, they made a midline incision over my patella and performed a median parapatellar arthrotomy. they removed the lateral patellar retinacular ligaments and retracted the patella laterally. then, they denuded the proximal medial tibia and released the acl and pcl. they also removed the medial and lateral menisci and suprapatellar fat pad to allow for anterior subluxation of the tibia. 

[doctor]: i see. and then what happened? 

[patient]: they pinned an extramedullary tibial cutting jig to the proximal tibia, and made a flush cut along the tibial plateau. after that, they drilled an intramedullary hole into the femur and inserted a femoral rod attached to the anterior cutting block. the block was pinned in the appropriate position, and they made an anterior rough cut. the distal cutting jig was then placed atop this cut surface and pinned to the distal femur. 

[doctor]: and how did they ensure everything was aligned correctly? 

[patient]: they used a variety of techniques to judge correct rotation, then sized the femoral component with a sizer and pinned the appropriate size femoral 4-in-1 chamfer-cutting block in place. they made the cuts, then pinned the notch-cutting block to the cut surface slightly laterally and made the notch cut. they then impacted the trial femoral component onto the distal femur and found it to have an excellent fit. 

[doctor]: that's great. and what about the tibial component? 

[patient]: they inserted a trial tibial plate and polyethylene, and judged stability to be adequate in all planes. they identified the appropriate rotation of the tibial component and marked it, then pinned the plate to the plateau. they made the keel, and after placing the femoral component, checked range of motion and stability in various ranges of flexion and extension. 

[doctor]: sounds like they were very thorough. and then what happened with the patella? 

[patient]: the patella was held in a slightly everted position with the knee in extension. they checked the width with calipers, then performed a free-hand cut of the patellar articular surface and checked to ensure symmetry with the calipers. they drilled 3 lug holes with the jig in place, taking care to medialize and superiorize the component as much as possible given bony anatomy. they recessed any excess lateral patellar bone, and the trial patellar component was placed and found to have adequate tracking. 

[doctor]: and then they applied cement to the components and cut surfaces, and impacted the components. they removed any excess cement, and the knee was brought into full extension with the trial polyethylene and further axially pressurized as cement hardened. after that, the tourniquet was deflated, and the knee was dislocated again. they removed any excess cement with an osteotome, then thoroughly irrigated and obtained adequate hemostasis. they closed the arthrotomy and subcutaneous tissues with sutures, and sealed the skin with staples. 

[patient]: yes, that's pretty much it.

[patient]: they pinned an extramedullary tibial cutting jig to the proximal tibia, and made a flush cut along the tibial plateau. after that, they drilled an intramedullary hole into the femur and inserted a femoral rod attached to the anterior cutting block. the block was pinned in the appropriate position, and they made an anterior rough cut. the distal cutting jig was then placed atop this cut surface and pinned to the distal femur. 

[doctor]: and how did they ensure everything was aligned correctly? 

[patient]: they used a variety of techniques to judge correct rotation, then sized the femoral component with a sizer and pinned the appropriate size femoral 4-in-1 chamfer-cutting block in place. they made the cuts, then pinned the notch-cutting block to the cut surface slightly laterally and made the notch cut. they then impacted the trial femoral component onto the distal femur and found it to have an excellent fit. 

[doctor]: that's great. and what about the tibial component? 

[patient]: they inserted a trial tibial plate and polyethylene, and judged stability to be adequate in all planes. they identified the appropriate rotation of the tibial component and marked it, then pinned the plate to the plateau. they made the keel, and after placing the femoral component, checked range of motion and stability in various ranges of flexion and extension. 

[doctor]: sounds like they were very thorough. and then what happened with the patella? 

[patient]: the patella was held in a slightly everted position with the knee in extension. they checked the width with calipers, then performed a free-hand cut of the patellar articular surface and checked to ensure symmetry with the calipers. they drilled 3 lug holes with the jig in place, taking care to medialize and superiorize the component as much as possible given bony anatomy. they recessed any excess lateral patellar bone, and the trial patellar component was placed and found to have adequate tracking. 

[doctor]: and then they applied cement to the components and cut surfaces, and impacted the components. they removed any excess cement, and the knee was brought into full extension with the trial polyethylene and further axially pressurized as cement hardened. after that, the tourniquet was deflated, and the knee was dislocated again. they removed any excess cement with an osteotome, then thoroughly irrigated and obtained adequate hemostasis. they closed the arthrotomy and subcutaneous tissues with sutures, and sealed the skin with staples. 

[patient]: yes, that's pretty much it. 

[doctor]: well, it sounds like everything went well. we'll check on your recovery in the coming days.",1
"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES,1.  Uncontrolled open angle glaucoma, left eye.
2.  Conjunctival scarring, left eye.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES,1.  Uncontrolled open angle glaucoma, left eye.
2.  Conjunctival scarring, left eye.
PROCEDURES:
Short flap trabeculectomy with lysis of conjunctival scarring, tenonectomy, peripheral iridectomy, paracentesis, watertight conjunctival closure, and 0.5 mg/mL mitomycin x2 minutes, left eye.
ANESTHESIA:
Retrobulbar block with monitored anesthesia care.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
Negligible.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
The patient was brought to the operating suite where the Anesthesia team established a peripheral IV as well as monitoring lines.  In the preoperative area, the patient received pilocarpine drops.  The patient received IV propofol and once somnolent from this, a retrobulbar block was administered consisting of 2% Xylocaine plain.  Approximately 3 mL were given.  The operative eye then underwent a Betadine prep with respect to the face, lids, lashes, and eye.  During the draping process, care was taken to isolate the lashes.  A screw type speculum was inserted to maintain patency of lids.  A 6-0 Vicryl suture was placed through the superior cornea, and the eye was reflected downward to expose the superior conjunctiva.  A peritomy was performed approximately 8 to 10 mm posterior to the limbus and this flap was dissected forward to the cornea.  All Tenons were removed from the overlying sclera and the area was treated with wet-field cautery to achieve hemostasis.  A 2 mm x 3 mm scleral flap was then outlined with a Micro-Sharp blade.  This was approximately one-half scleral depth in thickness.  A crescent blade was then used to dissect forward the clear cornea.  Hemostasis was again achieved with wet-field cautery.  A Weck-Cel sponge tip soaked in mitomycin was then placed under the conjunctival and tenon flap and left there for two minutes.  The site was then profusely irrigated with balanced salt solution.  A paracentesis wound was made temporarily and then the Micro-Sharp blade was used to enter the anterior chamber at the anterior most margin of the trabeculectomy bed.  A Kelly-Descemet punch was then inserted, and a trabeculectomy was performed.  Iris was withdrawn through the trabeculectomy site and a peripheral iridectomy was performed using Vannas scissors and 0.12 forceps.  The iris was then repositioned into the eye and the anterior chamber was inflated with BSS.  The scleral flap was sutured in place with two 10-0 nylon sutures with knots trimmed, rotated, and buried.  The overlying conjunctiva was then closed with a running 8-0 Vicryl suture on a BV needle.  BSS was irrigated in the anterior chamber and the blood was noted to elevate nicely without leakage.  Antibiotic and steroid drops were placed in the eye as was homatropine 5%.  The antibiotic consisted of Vigamox and the steroid was Econopred Plus.  A patch and shield were placed over the eye after the drape was removed.  The patient was taken to the recovery room in good condition.  She will be seen in followup in the office tomorrow.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?

INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:
The patient is a 55-year-old Caucasian male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and O2 dependency of approximately 5 liters nasal cannula at home.  The patient with extensive smoking history who presents after risks, complications, and consequences of the SCOOP FastTract procedure were explained.
PROCEDURE:
The patient was brought to operating suite by Anesthesia and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  After this, the patient was then placed under total IV anesthesia and the operating bed was then placed in reverse Trendelenburg.  The patient's sternal notch along with cricoid and thyroid cartilages were noted and palpated and a sternal marker was utilized to mark the cricoid cartilage in the sternal notch.  The midline was also marked and 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:100,000 at approximately 4 cc total was then utilized to localize the neck.  After this, the patient was then prepped and draped with Hibiclens.  A skin incision was then made in the midline with a #15 Bard-Parker in a vertical fashion.  After this, the skin was retracted laterally and a small anterior jugular branch was clamped and cross clamped and tied with #2-0 undyed Vicryl ties.  Further bleeding was controlled with monopolar cauterization and attention was then drawn down on to the strap muscles.  The patient's sternohyoid muscle was identified and grasped on either side and the midline raphe was identified.  Cauterization was then utilized to take down the midline raphe and further dissection was utilized with the skin hook and stat clamps.  The anterior aspect of the thyroid isthmus was identified and palpation on the cricoid cartilage was performed.  The cricoid cauterization over the cricoid cartilage was obtained with the monopolar cauterization and blunt dissection then was carried along the posterior aspect of the thyroid isthmus.  Stats were then placed on either side of the thyroid isthmus and the mid portion was bisected with the monopolar cauterization.  After this, the patient's anterior trachea was then identified and cleaned with pusher.  After this, the cricoid cartilage along the first and second tracheal rings was identified.  The cricoid hook was placed and the trachea was brought more anteriorly and superiorly.  After this, the patient's head incision was placed below the second tracheal ring with a #15 Bard-Parker.  After this, the patient had a tracheal punch with the SCOOP FastTract kit to create a small 4 mm punch within the tracheal cartilage.  After this, the patient then had a tracheal stent placed within the tracheal punched lumen and the patient was then had the tracheal stent secured to the neck with a Vicryl strap.  After this, the cricoid hook was removed and the patient then had FiO2 on the monitor noted with pulse oximetry of 100%.  The patient was then turned back to the anesthesia and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and will stay in the hospital for approximately 23 hours.  The patient will have the stent guidewire removed with a scoop catheter 11 cm placed.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling after your procedure?

"PROCEDURE:
Total hip replacement.
PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:
The patient was bought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  After induction of anesthesia, the patient was turned on the side and secured in the hip table.  An incision was made, centered over the greater trochanter.  Dissection was sharply carried down through the subcutaneous tissues.  The gluteus maximus was incised and split proximally.  The piriformis and external rotators were identified.  These were removed from their insertions on the greater trochanter as a sleeve with the hip capsule.  The hip was dislocated.  A femoral neck cut was made using the guidance of preoperative templating.  The femoral head was removed.  Extensive degenerative disease was found on the femoral head as well as in the acetabulum.
Baseline leg-length measurements were taken.  The femur was retracted anteriorly and a complete labrectomy was performed.  Reaming of the acetabulum was then performed until adequate bleeding subchondral bone was identified in the key areas.  The trial shell was placed and found to have an excellent fit.  The real shell was opened and impacted into position in the appropriate amount of anteversion and abduction.  Screws were placed by drilling into the pelvis, measuring, and placing the appropriate length screw.  Excellent purchase was obtained.  The trial liner was placed.
The femur was then flexed and internally rotated.  The extra trochanteric bone was removed, as was any leftover lateral soft tissue at the piriformis insertion.  An intramedullary hole was drilled into the femur to define the canal.  Reaming was performed until the appropriate size was reached.  The broaches were then used to prepare the femur with the appropriate amount of version.  Once the appropriate size broach was reached, it was used as a trial with head and neck placement.  Hip range-of-motion was checked in all planes, including flexion-internal rotation, the position of sleep, and extension-external rotation.  The hip was found to have excellent stability with the final chosen head-neck combination.  Leg length measurements were taken and found to be within acceptable range, given the necessity for stability.
The real stem was opened and impacted into position.  The real head was impacted atop the stem.  If cement was used, the canal was thoroughly washed and dried and plugged with a restrictor, and then the cement was injected and pressurized and the stem was implanted in the appropriate version.  Excess cement was removed from the edges of the component.  Range of motion and stability were once again checked and found to be excellent.  Adequate hemostasis was obtained.  Vigorous power irrigation was used to remove all debris from the joint prior to final reduction.
The arthrotomy and rotators were closed using #1 Ethibond through drill holes in the bone, recreating the posterior hip structural anatomy.  The gluteus maximus was repaired using 0 Ethibond and 0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed after further irrigation with 2-0 Vicryl and Monocryl sutures.  The skin was closed with nylon.  Xeroform and a sterile dressing were applied followed by a cold pack and Ace wrap.  The patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition, having tolerated the procedure well.","[doctor] hi there! how are you feeling after your hip replacement surgery?

**,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  Next the neck, chest and legs were prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  We used a #10-blade scalpel to make a midline median sternotomy incision.  Dissection was carried down to the left of the sternum using Bovie electrocautery.  The sternum was opened with a sternal saw.  The chest retractor was positioned.  Next, full-dose heparin was given.  The pericardium was opened.  Pericardial stay sutures were positioned.  After obtaining adequate ACT, we prepared to place the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass.  A 2-0 double pursestring of Ethibond suture was placed in the ascending aorta.  Through this was passed an aortic cannula connected to the arterial side of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.  Next a 3-0 Prolene pursestring was placed in the right atrial appendage.  Through this was passed our venous cannula connected to the venous portion of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.  A 4-0 U-stitch was placed in the right atrium.  A retrograde cardioplegia catheter was positioned at this site.  Next, scissors were used to dissect out the right upper pulmonary vein.  A 4-0 Prolene pursestring was placed in the right upper pulmonary vein.  Next, a right-angle sump was placed at this position.  We then connected our retrograde cardioplegia catheter to the cardioplegia solution circuit.  Bovie electrocautery was used to dissect the interface between the aorta and pulmonary artery.  The aorta was completely encircled.  Next, an antegrade cardioplegia needle and associated sump were placed in the ascending aorta.  We then prepared to cross-clamp the aorta.  We went down on our flows and cross-clamped the aorta.  We backed up our flows.  We then gave antegrade and retrograde cold blood cardioplegia solution circuit so as to arrest the heart.  The patient had some aortic insufficiency so we elected, after initially arresting the heart, to open the aorta and transect it and then give direct ostial infusion of cardioplegia solution circuit.  Next, after obtaining complete diastolic arrest of the heart, we turned our attention to exposing the aortic valve, and 4-0 Tycron sutures were placed in the commissures.  In addition, a 2-0 Prolene suture was placed in the aortic wall so as to bring the aortic wall and root up into view.  Next, scissors were used to excise the diseased aortic valve leaflets.  Care was taken to remove all the calcium from the aortic annulus.  We then sized up the aortic annulus which came out to be a **-mm stentless porcine Toronto valve.  We prepared the valve.  Next, we placed our proximal suture line of interrupted 4-0 Tycron sutures for the annulus.  We started with our individual commissural stitches.  They were connected to our valve sewing ring.  Next, we placed 5 interrupted 4-0 Tycron sutures in a subannular fashion at each commissural position.  After doing so, we passed 1 end of the suture through the sewing portion of the Toronto stentless porcine valve.  The valve was lowered into place and all of the sutures were tied.  Next, we gave another round of cold blood antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia.  Next, we sewed our distal suture line.  We began with the left coronary cusp of the valve.  We ran a 5-0 RB needle up both sides of the valve.  Care was taken to avoid the left coronary ostia.  This procedure was repeated on the right cusp of the stentless porcine valve.  Again, care was taken to avoid any injury to the coronary ostia.  Lastly, we sewed our non-coronary cusp.  This was done without difficulty.  At this point we inspected our aortic valve.  There was good coaptation of the leaflets, and it was noted that both the left and the right coronary ostia were open.  We gave another round of cold blood antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia.  The antegrade portion was given in a direct ostial fashion once again.  We now turned our attention to closing the aorta.  A 4-0 Prolene double row of suture was used to close the aorta in a running fashion.  Just prior to closing, we de-aired the heart and gave a warm shot of antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia.  At this point, we removed our aortic cross-clamp.  The heart gradually regained its electromechanical activity.  We placed 2 atrial and 2 ventricular pacing wires.  We removed our aortic vent and oversewed that site with another 4-0 Prolene on an SH needle.  We removed our retrograde cardioplegia catheter.  We oversewed that site with a 5-0 Prolene.  By now, the heart was de-aired and resumed normal electromechanical activity.  We began to wean the patient from cardiopulmonary bypass.  We then removed our venous cannula and suture ligated that site with a #2 silk.  We then gave full-dose protamine.  After knowing that there was no evidence of a protamine reaction, we removed the aortic cannula.  We buttressed that site with a 4-0 Prolene on an SH needle.  We placed a mediastinal chest tube and brought it out through the skin.  We also placed 2 Blake drains, 1 in the left chest and 1 in the right chest, as the patient had some bilateral pleural effusions.  They were brought out through the skin.  The sternum was closed with #7 wires in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  The fascia was closed with #1 Vicryl.  We closed the subcu tissue with 2-0 Vicryl and the skin with 4-0 PDS.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after your surgery?

"POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Chronic adenotonsillitis.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.
ANESTHESIA:
General endotracheal tube.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
Minimum, less than 5 cc.
SPECIMENS:
Right and left tonsils 2+, adenoid pad 1+.  There was no adenoid specimen.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
HISTORY:
The patient is a 9-year-old Caucasian male with history of recurrent episodes of adenotonsillitis that has been refractory to outpatient antibiotic therapy.  The patient has had approximately four to five episodes of adenotonsillitis per year for the last three to four years.
PROCEDURE:
Informed consent was properly obtained from the patient's parents and the patient was taken to the operating room #3 and was placed in a supine position.  He was placed under general endotracheal tube anesthesia by the Department of Anesthesia.  The bed was then rolled away from Department of Anesthesia.  A shoulder roll was then placed beneath the shoulder blades and a blue towel was then fashioned as a turban wrap.  The McIvor mouth gag was carefully positioned into the patient's mouth with attention to avoid the teeth.
The retractor was then opened and the oropharynx was visualized.  The adenoid pad was then visualized with a laryngeal mirror.  The adenoids appeared to be 1+ and non-obstructing.  There was no evidence of submucosal cleft palate palpable.  There was no evidence of bifid uvula.  A curved Allis clamp was then used to grasp the superior pole of the right tonsil.  The tonsil was then retracted inferiorly and medially.  Bovie cautery was used to make an incision on the mucosa of the right anterior tonsillar pillar to find the appropriate plane of dissection.  The tonsil was then dissected out within this plane using a Bovie.  Tonsillar sponge was re-applied to the tonsillar fossa.  Suction cautery was then used to adequately obtain hemostasis with the tonsillar fossa.  Attention was then directed to the left tonsil.  The curved Allis was used to grasp the superior pole of the left tonsil and it was retracted inferiorly and medially.  Bovie cautery was used to make an incision in the mucosa of the left anterior tonsillar pillar and define the appropriate plane of dissection.  The tonsil was then dissected out within this plane using the Bovie.  Next, complete hemostasis was achieved within the tonsillar fossae using suction cautery.  After adequate hemostasis was obtained, attention was directed towards the adenoid pad.  The adenoid pad was again visualized and appeared 1+ and was non-obstructing.  Decision was made to use suction cautery to cauterize the adenoids.  Using a laryngeal mirror under direct visualization, the adenoid pad was then cauterized with care to avoid the eustachian tube orifices as well as the soft palate and inferior turbinates.  After cauterization was complete, the nasopharynx was again visualized and tonsillar sponge was applied.  Adequate hemostasis was achieved.  The tonsillar fossae were again visualized and no evidence of bleeding was evident.  The throat pack was removed from the oropharynx and the oropharynx was suctioned.  There was no evidence of any further bleeding.  A flexible suction catheter was then used to suction out the nasopharynx to the oropharynx.  The suction catheter was also used to suction up the stomach.  Final look revealed no evidence of further bleeding and 10 mg of Decadron was given intraoperatively.
DISPOSITION:
The patient tolerated the procedure well and the patient was transported to the recovery room in stable condition.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after the tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy?
[patient] i'm feeling a little sore, but okay.
[doctor] that's good to hear. we performed the surgery because you have had about four to five episodes of adenotonsillitis per year for the last three to four years. how has your experience been with that?

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Obstructive adenotonsillar hypertrophy with chronic recurrent pharyngitis.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Obstructive adenotonsillar hypertrophy with chronic recurrent pharyngitis.
SURGICAL PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.
ANESTHESIA:
General endotracheal technique.
SURGICAL FINDINGS:
A 4+/4+ cryptic and hypertrophic tonsils with 2+/3+ hypertrophic adenoid pads.
INDICATIONS:
We were requested to evaluate the patient for complaints of enlarged tonsils, which cause difficulty swallowing, recurrent pharyngitis, and sleep-induced respiratory disturbance.  She was evaluated and scheduled for an elective procedure.
DESCRIPTION OF SURGERY:
The patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating room table.  General anesthetic was administered.  Once appropriate anesthetic findings were achieved, the patient was intubated and prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner for a tonsillectomy.  He was placed in semi-Rose ___ position and a Crowe Davis-type mouth gag was introduced into the oropharynx.  Under an operating headlight, the oropharynx was clearly visualized.  The right tonsil was grasped with the fossa triangularis and using electrocautery enucleation technique, was removed from its fossa.  This followed placing the patient in a suspension position using a McIvor-type mouth gag and a red rubber Robinson catheter via the right naris.  Once the right tonsil was removed, the left tonsil was removed in a similar manner, once again using a needle point Bovie dissection at 20 watts.  With the tonsils removed, it was possible to visualize the adenoid pads.  The oropharynx was irrigated and the adenoid pad evaluated with an indirect mirror technique.  The adenoid pad was greater than 2+/4 and hypertrophic.  It was removed with successive passes of electrocautery suction.  The tonsillar fossa was then once again hemostased with suction cautery, injected with 0.5% ropivacaine with 1:100,000 adrenal solution and then closed with 2-0 Monocryl on an SH needle.  The redundant soft tissue of the uvula was removed posteriorly and cauterized with electrocautery to prevent swelling of the uvula in the postoperative period.  The patient's oropharynx and nasopharynx were irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline contained with small amount of iodine, and she was recovered from her general endotracheal anesthetic.  She was extubated and left the operating room in good condition to the postoperative recovery room area.
Estimated blood loss was minimal.  There were no complications.  Specimens produced were right and left tonsils.  The adenoid pad was ablated with electrocautery.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling?

[doctor] that's expected. your surgery was successful. we found that you had 4+/4+ cryptic and hypertrophic tonsils with 2+/3+ hypertrophic adenoid pads. these were causing difficulty swallowing, recurrent pharyngitis, and sleep-induced respiratory disturbance. so, we removed them with the electrocautery enucleation technique.
[patient] oh, i see. that sounds serious.
[doctor] it was a necessary procedure to relieve your symptoms. we irrigated your oropharynx and nasopharynx with normal saline and a small amount of iodine, and hemostased the tonsillar fossa with suction cautery. we injected 0.5% ropivacaine with 1:100,000 adrenal solution to the area before closing it with 2-0 monocryl on an sh needle. we also removed the redundant soft tissue of the uvula and cauterized it with electrocautery to prevent swelling of the uvula in the postoperative period.

General endotracheal.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
The patient was taken to the operating room and prepped and draped in the usual fashion after induction of general endotracheal anesthesia.  The McIvor mouth gag was placed in the oral cavity, and a tongue depressor applied.  Two #12-French red rubber Robinson catheters were placed, 1 in each nasal passage, and brought out through the oral cavity and clamped over a dental gauze roll placed on the upper lip to provide soft palate retraction.
The nasopharynx was inspected with a laryngeal mirror.  The adenoid tissue was fulgurated with the suction Bovie set at 35.  The catheters and the dental gauze roll were then removed.  The anterior tonsillar pillars were infiltrated with 0.5% Marcaine and epinephrine.  Using the radiofrequency wand, the tonsils were ablated bilaterally.  If bleeding occurred, it was treated with the wand on coag mode using a coag mode of 3 and an ablation mode of 9.  The tonsillectomy was completed.
The nasopharynx and nasal passages were suctioned free of debris, and the procedure was terminated.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the operating room in good condition.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after your tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy surgery?

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome with hypertrophy of tonsils and of uvula and soft palate.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome with hypertrophy of tonsils and of uvula and soft palate with deviation of nasal septum.
OPERATION:
Tonsillectomy, uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, and septoplasty.
ANESTHESIA:
General anesthetics.
HISTORY:
This is a 51-year-old gentleman here with his wife.  She confirms the history of loud snoring at night with witnessed apnea.  The result of the sleep study was reviewed.  This showed moderate sleep apnea with significant desaturation.  The patient was unable to tolerate treatment with CPAP.  At the office, we observed large tonsils and elongation and thickening of the uvula as well as redundant soft tissue of the palate.  A tortuous appearance of the septum also was observed.  This morning, I talked to the patient and his wife about the findings.  I reviewed the CT images.  He has no history of sinus infections and does not recall a history of nasal trauma.  We discussed the removal of tonsils and uvula and soft palate tissue and the hope that this would help with his airway.  Depending on the findings of surgery, I explained that I might remove that bone spur that we are seeing within the nasal passage.  I will get the best look at it when he is asleep.  We discussed recovery as well.  He visited with Dr. XYZ about the anesthetic produce.
PROCEDURE:
:  General tracheal anesthetic was administered by Dr. XYZ and Mr. Radke.  Afrin drops were placed in both nostrils and a cottonoid soaked with Afrin was placed in each side of the nose.  A Crowe-Davis mouth gag was placed.  The tonsils were very large and touched the uvula.  The uvula was relatively long and very thick and there were redundant folds of soft palate mucosa and prominent posterior and anterior tonsillar pillars.  Also, there was a cryptic appearance of the tonsils but there was no acute redness or exudate.  Retraction of the soft palate permitted evaluation of the nasopharynx with the mirror and the choanae were patent and there was no adenoid tissue present.  A very crowded pharynx was appreciated.  The tonsils were first removed using electrodissection technique.  Hemostasis was achieved with the electrocautery and with sutures of 0 plain catgut.  The tonsil fossae were injected with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine.  There already was more room in the pharynx, but the posterior pharyngeal wall was still obscured by the soft palate and uvula.  The uvula was grasped with the Alice clamp.  I palpated the posterior edge of the hard palate and calculated removal of about a third of the length of the soft palate.  We switched over from the Bayonet cautery to the blunt needle tip electrocautery.  The planned anterior soft palate incision was marked out with the electrocautery from the left anterior tonsillar pillar rising upwards and then extending horizontally across the soft palate to include all of the uvula and a portion of the soft palate, and the incision then extended across the midline and then inferiorly to meet the right anterior tonsillar pillar.  This incision was then deepened with the electrocautery on a cutting current.  The uvular artery just to the right of the midline was controlled with the suction electrocautery.  The posterior soft palate incision was made parallel to the anterior soft palate incision but was made leaving a longer length of mucosa to permit closure of the palatoplasty.  A portion of the redundant soft palate mucosa tissue also was included with the resection specimen and the tissue including the soft palate and uvula was included with the surgical specimen as the tonsils were sent to pathology.  The tonsil fossae were injected with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine.  The soft palate was also injected with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine.  The posterior tonsillar pillars were then brought forward to close to the anterior tonsillar pillars and these were sutured down to the tonsil bed with interrupted 0 plain catgut sutures.  The posterior soft palate mucosa was advanced forward and brought up to the anterior soft palate incision and closure of the soft palate wound was then accomplished with interrupted 3-0 chromic catgut sutures.  A much improved appearance of the oropharynx with a greatly improved airway was appreciated.  A moist tonsil sponge was placed into the nasopharynx and the mouth gag was removed.  I removed the cottonoids from both nostrils.  Speculum exam showed the inferior turbinates were large, the septum was tortuous and it angulated to the right and then sharply bent back to the left.  The septum was injected with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine using a separate syringe and needle.  A #15 blade was used to make a left cheilion incision.
Mucoperichondrium and mucoperiosteum were elevated with the Cottle elevator.  When we reached the deflected portion of the vomer, this was separated from the septal cartilage with a Freer elevator.  The right-sided mucoperiosteum was elevated with the Freer elevator and then with Takahashi forceps and with the 4 mm osteotome, the deflected portion of the septal bone from the vomer was resected.  This tissue also was sent as a separate specimen to pathology.  The intraseptal space was irrigated with saline and suctioned.  The nasal septal mucosal flaps were then sutured together with a quilting suture of 4-0 plain catgut.  I observed no evidence of purulent secretion or polyp formation within the nostrils.  The inferior turbinates were then both outfractured using a knife handle, and now there was a much more patent nasal airway on both sides.  There was good support for the nasal tip and the dorsum and there was good hemostasis within the nose.  No packing was used in the nostrils.  Polysporin ointment was introduced into both nostrils.  The mouth gag was reintroduced and the pack removed from the nasopharynx.  The nose and throat were irrigated with saline and suctioned.  An orogastric tube was placed and a moderate amount of clear fluid suctioned from the stomach and this tube was removed.  Sponge and needle count were reported correct.  The mouth gag having been withdrawn, the patient was then awakened and returned to recovery room in a satisfactory condition.  He tolerated the operation excellently.  Estimated blood loss was about 15-20 cc.  In the recovery room, I observed that he was moving air well and I spoke with his wife about the findings of surgery.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling?

HISTORY:
The patient is 5-1/2 years old.  She is here this morning with her Mom.  She has very large tonsils and she snores at night and gets up frequently at night and does not sleep well.  At the office we saw the tonsils were very big.  There was a rock in the right ear and it was very deep in the canal, near the drum.  We will remove the foreign body under the same anesthetic.
PROCEDURE:
:  Natalie was placed under general anesthetic by the orotracheal route of administration, under Dr. XYZ and Ms. B.  I looked into the left ear under the microscope, took out a little wax and observed a normal eardrum.  On the right side, I took out some impacted wax and removed the rock with a large suction.  It was actually resting on the surface of the drum but had not scarred or damaged the drum.  The drum was intact with no evidence of middle ear fluid.  The microscope was set aside.  Afrin drops were placed in both nostrils.  The neck was gently extended and the Crowe-Davis mouth gag inserted.  The tonsils and adenoids were very large.  The uvula was intact.  Adenoidectomy was performed using the adenoid curette with a tonsil sponge placed into the nasopharynx.  Tonsillectomy accomplished by sharp and blunt dissection.  Hemostasis achieved with electrocautery and the tonsils beds injected with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine.  Sutures of zero plain catgut next were used to re-approximate the posterior to the anterior tonsillar pillars, suturing these down to the tonsillar beds.  Sponge is removed from the nasopharynx.  The suction electrocautery was used for pinpoint hemostasis on the adenoid bed.  We made sure the cautery tip did not come into the contact with the soft palate or the eustachian tube orifices.  The nose and throat were then irrigated with saline and suctioned.  Excellent hemostasis was observed.  An orogastric tube was placed.  The stomach found to be empty.  The tube was removed, as was the mouth gag.  Sponge and needle count were reported correct.  The child was then awakened and prepared for her to return to the recovery room.  She tolerated the operation excellently.","[doctor] hi there! how are you feeling after your surgery?

A thyroidectomy was indicated at this time secondary to the patient's chronic condition.  Indications, alternatives, risks, consequences, benefits, and details of the procedure including specifically the risk of recurrent laryngeal nerve paresis or paralysis or vocal cord dysfunction and possible trach were discussed with the patient in detail.  She agreed to proceed.  A full informed consent was obtained.
PROCEDURE:
The patient presented to ABCD General Hospital on 09/04/2003 with the history was reviewed and physical examinations was evaluated.  The patient was brought by the Department of Anesthesiology, brought back to surgical suite and given IV access and general endotracheal anesthesia.  A 9 cc of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 of epinephrine was infiltrated into the area of pre-demarcated above the suprasternal notch.  Time is allowed for full hemostasis to be achieved.  The patient was then prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  A #10 blade was then utilized to make an incision in the pre-demarcated and anesthetized area.  Unipolar electrocautery was utilized for hemostasis.  Finger dissection was carried out in the superior and inferior planes.  Platysma was identified and dissected and a subplatysmal plane was created in the superior and inferior, medial and lateral directions using hemostat, Metzenbaum, and blunt dissection.  The strap muscles were identified.  The midline raphe was not easily identifiable at this time.  An incision was made through what appeared to be in the midline raphe and dissection was carried down to the thyroid.  Sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscles were identified and separated on the patient's right side and then subsequently on the left side.  It was noted at this time that the thyroid lobule on the right side is a bi-lobule.  Kitner blunt dissection was utilized to bluntly dissect the overlying thyroid fascia as well as strap muscles off the thyroid, force in the lateral direction.  This was carried down to the inferior and superior areas.  The superior pole of the right lobule was then identified.  A hemostat was placed in the cricothyroid groove and a Kitner was placed in this area.  A second Kitner was placed on lateral aspect of the superior pole and the superior pole of the right thyroid was retracted inferiorly.  Careful dissection was then carried out in a very meticulous fashion in the superior lobe and identified the appropriate vessels and cauterized with bipolar or ligated with the suture ligature.  This was carried out until the superior pole was identified.  Careful attention was made to avoid nerve injury in this area.  Dissection was then carried down again bluntly separating the inferior and superior lobes.  The bilobed right thyroid was then retracted medially.  The recurrent laryngeal nerve was then identified and tracked to its insertion.  The overlying vessels of the middle thyroid vein as well as the associated structures were then identified and great attention was made to perform a right careful meticulous dissection to remove the fascial attachments superficial to the recurrent laryngeal nerve off the thyroid.  When it was completed, this lobule was then removed from Berry's ligament.  There was noted to be no isthmus at this time and the entire right lobule was then sent to the Pathology for further evaluation.  Attention was then diverted to the patient's left side.  In a similar fashion, the sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscles were already separated.  Army-Navy as well as femoral retractors were utilized to lateralize the appropriate musculature.  The middle thyroid vein was identified.  Blunt dissection was carried out laterally to superiorly once again.  A hemostat was utilized to make an opening in the cricothyroid groove and a Kitner was then placed in this area.  Another Kitner was placed on the lateral aspect of the superior lobe of the left thyroid and retracted inferiorly.  Once again, a careful meticulous dissection was utilized to identify the appropriate structures in the superior pole of the left thyroid and suture ligature as well as bipolar cautery was utilized for hemostasis.  Once again, a careful attention was made not to injure the nerve in this area.  The superior pole was then freed appropriately and blunt dissection was carried down to lateral and inferior aspects.  The inferior aspect was then identified.  The inferior thyroid artery and vein were then identified and ligated.  The left thyroid was then medialized and the recurrent laryngeal nerve has been identified.  A careful dissection was then carried out to remove the fascial attachments superficial to the recurrent laryngeal nerve on the side as close to the thyroid gland as possible.  The thyroid was then removed from the Berry's ligament and it was then sent to Pathology for further evaluation.  Evaluation of the visceral space did not reveal any bleeding at this time.  This was irrigated and pinpoint areas were bipolored as necessary.  Surgicel was then placed bilaterally.  The strap muscles as well as the appropriate fascial attachments were then approximated with a #3-0 Vicryl suture in the midline.  The platysma was identified and approximated with a #4-0 Vicryl suture and the subdermal plane was approximated with a #4-0 Vicryl suture.  A running suture consisting of #5-0 Prolene suture was then placed and fast absorbing #6-0 was then placed in a running fashion.  Steri-Strips, Tincoban, bacitracin and a pressure gauze was then placed.  The patient was then admitted for further evaluation and supportive care.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient was transferred to Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.","[doctor] hi, good afternoon. how are you feeling?

OPERATIVE INDICATIONS:
The patient is a 37-year-old male presenting with a history of chronic, persistent low back pain as well as left lower extremity of radicular character were recalcitrant to conservative management. Preoperative imaging studies revealed the above-noted abnormalities. After a detailed review of management considerations with the patient and his wife, he was elected to proceed as noted above.
Operative indications, methods, potential benefits, risks and alternatives were reviewed. The patient and his wife expressed understanding and consented to proceed as above.
OPERATIVE FINDINGS:
L4-L5 and L5-S1 disk protrusion with configuration as anticipated from preoperative imaging studies. Pedicle screw placement appeared satisfactory with satisfactory purchase and positioning noted at all sites as well as satisfactory findings upon probing of the pedicular tracts at each site. In addition, all pedicle screws were stimulated with findings of above threshold noted at all sites. Spacer snugness and positioning appeared satisfactory. Electrophysiological monitoring was carried out throughout the procedure and remained stable with no undue changes reported.
DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION:
After obtaining proper patient identification and appropriate preoperative informed consent, the patient was taken to the operating room on a hospital stretcher in the supine position. After the induction of satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia and placement of appropriate monitoring equipment by Anesthesiology as well as placement of electrophysiological monitoring equipment by the Neurology team, the patient was carefully turned to the prone position and placed upon the padded Jackson table with appropriate additional padding placed as needed. The patient's posterior lumbosacral region was thoroughly cleansed and shaved. The patient was then scrubbed, prepped and draped in the usual manner. After local infiltration with 1% lidocaine with 1: 200,000 epinephrine solution, a posterior midline skin incision was made extending from approximately L3 to the inferior aspect of the sacrum. Dissection was continued in the midline to the level of the posterior fascia. Self-retaining retractors were placed and subsequently readjusted as needed. The fascia was opened in the midline, and the standard subperiosteal dissection was then carried out to expose the posterior and posterolateral elements from L3-L4 to the sacrum bilaterally with lateral exposure carried out to the lateral aspect of the transverse processes of L4 and L5 as well as the sacral alae bilaterally. _____ by completing the exposure, pedicle screw fixation was carried out in the following manner. Screws were placed in systematic caudal in a cranial fashion. The pedicle screw entry sites were chosen using standard dorsal landmarks and fluoroscopic guidance as needed. Cortical openings were created at these sites using a small burr. The pedicular tracts were then preliminarily prepared using a Lenke pedicle finder. They were then probed and subsequently tapped employing fluoroscopic guidance as needed. Each site was ""under tapped"" and reprobed with satisfactory findings noted as above. Screws in the following dimensions were placed. 6.5-mm diameter screws were placed at all sites. At S1, 40-mm length screws were placed bilaterally. At L5, 40-mm length screws were placed bilaterally, and at L4, 40-mm length screws were placed bilaterally with findings as noted above. The rod was then contoured to span from the L4 to the S1 screws on the right. The distraction was placed across the L4-L5 interspace, and the connections were temporarily secured. Using a matchstick burr, a trough was then carefully created slightly off the midline of the left lamina extending from its caudal aspect to its more cranial aspect at the foraminal level. This was longitudinally oriented. A transverse trough was similarly carefully created from the cranial point of the longitudinal trough out to the lateral aspect of the pars against the foraminal level that is slightly caudal to the L4 pedicle. This trough was completed to the level of the ligamentum flavum using small angled curettes and Kerrison rongeurs, and this portion of the lamina along with the inferior L4 articular process was then removed as a unit using rongeurs and curettes. The cranial aspect of the left L5 superior articular process was then removed using a small burr and angled curettes and Kerrison rongeurs. A superior laminotomy was performed from the left L5 lamina and flavectomy was then carried out across this region of decompression, working from caudally to cranially and medially to laterally, again using curettes and Kerrison rongeurs under direct visualization. In this manner, the left lateral aspect of the thecal sac passing left L5 spinal nerve and exiting left L4 spinal nerve along with posterolateral aspect of disk space was exposed. Local epidural veins were coagulated with bipolar and divided. Gelfoam was then placed in this area. This process was then repeated in similar fashion; thereby, exposing the posterolateral aspect of the left L5-S1 disk space. As noted, distraction had previously been placed at L4-L5, this was released. Distraction was placed across the L5-S1 interspace. After completing satisfactory exposure as noted, a annulotomy was made in the posterolateral left aspect of the L5-S1 disk space. Intermittent neural retraction was employed with due caution afforded to the neural elements throughout the procedure. The disk space was entered, and diskectomy was carried out in routine fashion using pituitary rongeurs followed by the incremental sized disk space shavers as well as straight and then angled TLIF curettes to prepare the front plate. Herniated portions of the disk were also removed in routine fashion. The diskectomy and endplate preparation were carried out working progressively from the left towards the right aspect of the disk across the midline in routine fashion. After completing this disk space preparation, Gelfoam was again placed. The decompression was assessed and appeared to be satisfactory. The distraction was released, and attention was redirected at L4-L5, where again, distraction was placed and diskectomy and endplate preparation was carried out at this interspace again in similar fashion. After completing the disk space preparation, attention was redirected to L5-S1. Distraction was released at L4-L5 and again, reapplied at L5-S1, incrementally increasing size. Trial spaces were used, and a 10-mm height by 26-mm length spacer was chosen. A medium BMP kit was appropriately reconstituted. A BMP sponge containing morcellated vertebral autograft was then placed into the anterior aspect of the disk space. The spacer was then carefully impacted into position. The distraction was released. The spacer was checked with satisfactory snugness and positioning noted. This process was then repeated in similar fashion at L4-L5, again with placement of a 10-mm height by 26-mm length Capstone spacer, again containing BMP and again with initial placement of a BMP sponge with vertebral autograft anteriorly within the interspace. This spacer was also checked again with satisfactory snugness and positioning noted. The prior placement of the spacers and BMP, the wound was thoroughly irrigated and dried with satisfactory hemostasis noted. Surgicel was placed over the exposed dura and disk space. The distraction was released on the right and compression plates across the L5-S1 and L4-L5 interspaces and the connections fully tightened in routine fashion. The posterolateral elements on the right from L4 to S1 were prepared for fusion in routine fashion, and BMP sponges with supplemental vertebral autograft was placed in the posterolateral fusion bed as well as the vertebral autograft in the dorsal aspect of the L4-L5 and L5-S1 facets on the right in a routine fashion. A left-sided rod was appropriated contoured and placed to span between the L4 to S1 screws. Again compression was placed across the L4-L5 and L5-S1 segments, and these connections were fully secured. Thorough hemostasis was ascertained after checking the construct closely and fluoroscopically. The wound was closed using multiple simple interrupted 0-Vicryl sutures to reapproximate the deep paraspinal musculature in the midline. The superficial paraspinal musculature in posterior fashion was closed in the midline using multiple simple interrupted 0-Vicryl sutures. The suprafascial subcutaneous layers were closed using multiple simple interrupted #0 and 2-0 Vicryl sutures. The skin was then closed using staples. Sterile dressings were then applied and secured in place. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.","[doctor]: hi, how are you feeling after your surgery?
[patient]: hi, i'm feeling a bit sore but okay.

"TITLE OF OPERATION:
Total thyroidectomy for goiter.
INDICATION FOR SURGERY:
This is a 41-year-old woman who notes that compressive thyroid goiter and symptoms related to such who wishes to undergo surgery.  Risks, benefits, alternatives of the procedures were discussed in great detail with the patient.  Risks include but were not limited to anesthesia, bleeding, infection, injury to nerve, vocal fold paralysis, hoarseness, low calcium, need for calcium supplementation, tumor recurrence, need for additional treatment, need for thyroid medication, cosmetic deformity, and other.  The patient understood all these issues and they wished to proceed.
PREOP DIAGNOSIS:
Multinodular thyroid goiter with compressive symptoms and bilateral dominant thyroid nodules proven to be benign by fine needle aspiration.
POSTOP DIAGNOSIS:
Multinodular thyroid goiter with compressive symptoms and bilateral dominant thyroid nodules proven to be benign by fine needle aspiration.
ANESTHESIA:
General endotracheal.
PROCEDURE DETAIL:
After identifying the patient, the patient was placed supine in a operating room table.  After establishing general anesthesia via oral endotracheal intubation with a 6 Nerve Integrity monitoring system endotracheal tube.  The eyes were then tacked with Tegaderm.  The Nerve Integrity monitoring system, endotracheal tube was confirmed to be working adequately.  Essentially a 7 cm incision was employed in the lower skin crease of the neck.  A 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine were given.  Shoulder roll was applied.  The patient prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A 15-blade was used to make the incision.  Subplatysmal flaps were raised to the thyroid notch and sternal respectively.  The strap muscles were separated in the midline.  As we then turned to the left side where the sternohyoid muscle was separated from the sternothyroid muscle there was a very dense and firm thyroid mass on the left side.  The sternothyroid muscle was transected horizontally.  Similar procedure was performed on the right side.
Attention was then turned to identify the trachea in the midline.  Veins in this area and the pretracheal region were ligated with a harmonic scalpel.  Subsequently, attention was turned to dissecting the capsule off of the left thyroid lobe.  Again this was very firm in nature.  The superior thyroid pole was dissected in the superior third artery, vein, and the individual vessels were ligated with a harmonic scalpel.  The inferior and superior parathyroid glands were protected.  Recurrent laryngeal nerve was identified in the tracheoesophageal groove.  This had arborized early as a course underneath the inferior thyroid artery to a very small tiny anterior motor branch.  This was followed superiorly.  The level of cricothyroid membrane upon complete visualization of the entire nerve, Berry's ligament was transected and the nerve protected and then the thyroid gland was dissected over the trachea.  A prominent pyramidal level was also appreciated and dissected as well.
Attention was then turned to the right side.  There was significant amount of thyroid tissue that was very firm.  Multiple nodules were appreciated.  In a similar fashion, the capsule was dissected.  The superior and inferior parathyroid glands protected and preserved.  The superior thyroid artery and vein were individually ligated with the harmonic scalpel and the inferior thyroid artery was then ligated close to the thyroid gland capsule.  Once the recurrent laryngeal nerve was identified again on this side, the nerve had arborized early prior to the coursing underneath the inferior thyroid artery.  The anterior motor branch was then very fine, almost filamentous and stimulated at 0.5 milliamps, completely dissected toward the cricothyroid membrane with complete visualization.  A small amount of tissue was left at the Berry's ligament as the remainder of thyroid level was dissected over the trachea.  The entire thyroid specimen was then removed, marked with a stitch upon the superior pole.  The wound was copiously irrigated, Valsalva maneuver was given, bleeding points controlled.  The parathyroid glands appeared to be viable.  Both the anterior motor branches that were tiny were stimulated at 5 milliamps and confirmed to be working with the Nerve Integrity monitoring system.
Attention was then turned to burying the Surgicel on the wound bed on both sides.  The strap muscles were reapproximated in the midline using a 3-0 Vicryl suture of the sternothyroid horizontal transection and the strap muscles in the midline were then reapproximated.  The 1/8th inch Hemovac drain was placed and secured with a 3-0 nylon.  The incision was then closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl and Indermil for the skin.  The patient has a history of keloid formation and approximately 1 cubic centimeter of 40 mg per cubic centimeter Kenalog was injected into the incisional line using a tuberculin syringe and 25-gauge needle.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, was extubated in the operating room table, and sent to postanesthesia care unit in a good condition.  Upon completion of the case, fiberoptic laryngoscopy revealed intact bilateral true vocal fold mobility.","[doctor] hi, how are you doing after your surgery?
[patient] hi, doctor. i'm feeling a little sore but okay overall.
[doctor] that's to be expected. i just wanted to go over the details of your surgery with you. so we performed a total thyroidectomy for your multinodular thyroid goiter with compressive symptoms and bilateral dominant thyroid nodules that were proven to be benign by fine needle aspiration. you understood the risks and benefits of the procedure, including anesthesia, bleeding, infection, injury to nerves, vocal fold paralysis, hoarseness, low calcium, need for calcium supplementation, tumor recurrence, need for additional treatment, need for thyroid medication, cosmetic deformity, and others, is that correct?
[patient] yes, i understood all of that and still wanted to proceed with the surgery.
[doctor] great. during the surgery, we made a 7 cm incision in the lower skin crease of your neck and raised subplatysmal flaps to the thyroid notch and sternal respectively. we separated your strap muscles in the midline and used a harmonic scalpel to ligate the veins in the pretracheal region. we then dissected the capsule off your left thyroid lobe, which was very firm in nature, and ligated the superior thyroid pole in the superior third artery, vein, and the individual vessels. we protected your superior and inferior parathyroid glands and identified your recurrent laryngeal nerve in the tracheoesophageal groove.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] on the right side, there was a significant amount of thyroid tissue with multiple nodules that were also very firm. we dissected the capsule off the thyroid gland and protected your superior and inferior parathyroid glands. we ligated your superior thyroid artery and vein with the harmonic scalpel and your inferior thyroid artery close to the thyroid gland capsule. we identified your recurrent laryngeal nerve and confirmed that it was working properly. once we had complete visualization of the entire nerve, we transected berry's ligament and then dissected the thyroid gland over the trachea. we removed the entire thyroid specimen and marked it with a stitch upon the superior pole. we irrigated the wound, controlled the bleeding points, and buried the surgicel on the wound bed on both sides. we reapproximated your strap muscles in the midline and placed a hemovac drain. we closed your incision with interrupted sutures and injected some 40 mg per cubic centimeter kenalog into the incisional line to help with any potential keloid formation.
[patient] i see. and everything went well?
[doctor] yes, you tolerated the procedure well, and post-surgery, we did a fiberoptic laryngoscopy that revealed intact bilateral true vocal fold mobility. we will monitor your calcium levels and thyroid hormone levels and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss any further treatment if needed.
[patient] okay, thank you for explaining everything to me, doctor.
[doctor] of course, if you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out.","[doctor] hey there! how's it going after your surgery?

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Thrombosed arteriovenous shunt left forearm.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Thrombosed arteriovenous shunt, left forearm with venous anastomotic stenosis.
PROCEDURE:
Thrombectomy AV shunt, left forearm and patch angioplasty of the venous anastomosis.
ANESTHESIA:
Local.
SKIN PREP:
Betadine.
DRAINS:
None.
PROCEDURE TECHNIQUE:
The left arm was prepped and draped.  Xylocaine 1% was administered and a transverse antecubital incision was made over the venous limb of the graft, which was dissected out and encircled with a vessel loop.  The runoff vein was dissected out and encircled with the vessel loop as well.  A longitudinal incision was made over the venous anastomosis.  There was a narrowing in the area and slightly the incision was extended more proximally.  There was good back bleeding from the vein as well as bleeding from the more distal vein.  These were occluded with noncrushing DeBakey clamps and the patient was given 5000 units of heparin intravenously.  A #4 Fogarty was used to extract thrombus from the graft systematically until the arterial plug was removed and excellent inflow was established.  There was a narrowing in the mid portion of the venous limb of the graft, which was dilated with a #5 coronary dilator.  The Fogarty catheter was then passed up the vein, but no clot was obtained.  A patch PTFE material was fashioned and was sutured over the graftotomy with running 6-0 Gore-Tex suture.  Clamps were removed and flow established.  A thrill was easily palpable.  Hemostasis was achieved and the wound was irrigated and closed with 3-0 Vicryl subcutaneous suture followed by 4-0 nylon on the skin.  A sterile dressing was applied.  The patient was taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition having tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, instrument and needle counts were reported as correct.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after your procedure?
[patient] i'm feeling okay, a little sore.
[doctor] that's normal after a procedure like this. let me go over the details of what we did. we performed a thrombectomy on your arteriovenous shunt in your left forearm, which means we removed the blood clot that was causing the blockage. during the procedure, we also found a narrowing in the venous anastomosis, which is the connection between the vein and the graft. we performed a patch angioplasty to fix this issue, which involves placing a patch of ptfe material over the graftotomy to improve blood flow. we used a local anesthesia to numb the area, so you were awake during the procedure.
[patient] okay, i understand.
[doctor] good. we also administered heparin intravenously, which is a blood thinner, to prevent further clotting. we used a #4 fogarty catheter to systematically remove the thrombus, and dilated the narrowing with a #5 coronary dilator. we then closed the incision with sutures and applied a sterile dressing. you did well during the procedure, and we made sure to count all instruments and sponges to ensure nothing was left inside.
[patient] thank you for explaining everything to me.
[doctor] no problem. we will monitor you closely to make sure the shunt is working properly and there are no complications. you should avoid any strenuous activity with your left arm for a few days and keep the area clean and dry. if you experience any redness, swelling, or discharge from the wound, please let us know immediately. do you have any questions?
[patient] no, i think i understand everything. thank you, doctor.
[doctor] you're welcome. we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to make sure you're healing properly. take care.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after your procedure?
[patient] um i'm feeling okay, a little sore.
[doctor] mm-hmm that's normal after a procedure like this. let me go over the details of what we did. so, we performed a thrombectomy on your arteriovenous shunt in your left forearm, which means we removed the blood clot that was causing the blockage. during the procedure, we also found a narrowing in the venous anastomosis, which is the connection between the vein and the graft. we performed a patch angioplasty to fix this issue, which involves placing a patch of ptfe material over the graftotomy to improve blood flow. we used a local anesthesia to numb the area, so you were awake during the procedure.
[patient] okay, i understand.
[doctor] good. we also administered heparin intravenously, which is a blood thinner, to prevent further clotting. we used a #4 fogarty catheter to systematically remove the thrombus, and dilated the narrowing with a #5 coronary dilator. we then closed the incision with sutures and applied a sterile dressing. you did well during the procedure, and we made sure to count all instruments and sponges to ensure nothing was left inside.
[patient] umm thank you for explaining everything to me.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Esophageal rupture.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Esophageal rupture.
OPERATION PERFORMED,1.  Left thoracotomy with drainage of pleural fluid collection.
2.  Esophageal exploration and repair of esophageal perforation.
3.  Diagnostic laparoscopy and gastrostomy.
4.  Radiographic gastrostomy tube study with gastric contrast, interpretation.
ANESTHESIA:
General anesthesia.
INDICATIONS OF THE PROCEDURE:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of chronic esophageal stricture who is admitted with food sticking and retching.  He has esophageal rupture on CT scan and comes now for a thoracotomy and gastrostomy.
DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:
After an extensive informed consent discussion process, the patient was brought to the operating room.  He was placed in a supine position on the operating table.  After induction of general anesthesia and placement of a double lumen endotracheal tube, he was turned and placed in a right lateral decubitus position on a beanbag with appropriate padding and axillary roll.  Left chest was prepped and draped in a usual sterile fashion.  After administration of intravenous antibiotics, a left thoracotomy incision was made, dissection was carried down to the subcutaneous tissues, muscle layers down to the fifth interspace.  The left lung was deflated and the pleural cavity entered.  The Finochietto retractor was used to help provide exposure.  The sixth rib was shingled in the posterior position and a careful expiration of the left pleural cavity was performed.
Immediately encountered was left pleural fluid including some purulent fluid.  Cultures of this were sampled and sent for microbiology analysis.  The left pleural space was then copiously irrigated.  A careful expiration demonstrated that the rupture appeared to be sealed.  There was crepitus within the mediastinal cavity.  The mediastinum was opened and explored and the esophagus was explored.  The tissues of the esophagus appeared to show some friability and an area of the rupture in the distal esophagus.  It was not possible to place any stitches in this tissue and instead a small intercostal flap was developed and placed to cover the area.  The area was copiously irrigated, this provided nice coverage and repair.  After final irrigation and inspection, two chest tubes were placed including a #36 French right angled tube at the diaphragm and a posterior straight #36 French.  These were secured at the left axillary line region at the skin level with #0-silk.
The intercostal sutures were used to close the chest wall with a #2 Vicryl sutures.  Muscle layers were closed with running #1 Vicryl sutures.  The wound was irrigated and the skin was closed with skin staples.
The patient was then turned and placed in a supine position.  A laparoscopic gastrostomy was performed and then a diagnostic laparoscopy performed.  A Veress needle was carefully inserted into the abdomen, pneumoperitoneum was established in the usual fashion, a bladeless 5-mm separator trocar was introduced.  The laparoscope was introduced.  A single additional left-sided separator trocar was introduced.  It was not possible to safely pass a nasogastric or orogastric tube, pass the stricture and perforation and so the nasogastric tube was left right at the level where there was some stricture or narrowing or resistance.  The stomach however did have some air insufflation and we were able to place our T-fasteners through the anterior abdominal wall and through the anterior gastric wall safely.  The skin incision was made and the gastric lumen was then accessed with the Seldinger technique.  Guide wire was introduced into the stomach lumen and series of dilators was then passed over the guide wire.  #18 French Gastrostomy was then passed into the stomach lumen and the balloon was inflated.  We confirmed that we were in the gastric lumen and the balloon was pulled up, creating apposition of the gastric wall and the anterior abdominal wall.  The T-fasteners were all crimped and secured into position.  As was in the plan, the gastrostomy was secured to the skin and into the tube.  Sterile dressing was applied.  Aspiration demonstrated gastric content.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Left mesothelioma, focal.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Left pleural-based nodule.
PROCEDURES PERFORMED:
1.  Left thoracoscopy.
2.  Left mini thoracotomy with resection of left pleural-based mass.
FINDINGS:
Left anterior pleural-based nodule, which was on a thin pleural pedicle with no invasion into the chest wall.
FLUIDS:
800 mL of crystalloid.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
Minimal.
DRAINS, TUBES, CATHETERS:
24-French chest tube in the left thorax plus Foley catheter.
SPECIMENS:
Left pleural-based nodule.
INDICATION FOR OPERATION:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with previous history of follicular thyroid cancer, approximately 40 years ago, status post resection with recurrence in the 1980s, who had a left pleural-based mass identified on chest x-ray.  Preoperative evaluation included a CT scan, which showed focal mass.  CT and PET confirmed anterior lesion.  Therefore the patient was seen in our thoracic tumor board where it was recommended to have resection performed with chest wall reconstruction.  In the outpatient setting, the patient was willing to proceed.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED IN DETAIL:
After informed consent was obtained, the patient identified correctly.  She was taken to the operating room where an epidural catheter was placed by Anesthesia without difficulty.  She was sedated and intubated with double-lumen endotracheal tube without difficulty.  She was positioned with left side up.  Appropriate pressure points were padded.  The left chest was prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  The skin incision was made in the posterior axillary line, approximately 7th intercostal space with #10 blade, taken down through tissues and Bovie electrocautery.
Pleura was entered.  There was good deflation of the left lung.  __________ port was placed, followed by the 0-degree 10-mm scope with appropriate patient positioning.  Posteriorly a pedunculated 2.5 x 3-cm pleural-based mass was identified on the anterior chest wall.  There were thin adhesions to the pleura, but no invasion of the chest wall that could be identified.  The tumor was very mobile and was on a pedunculated stalk, approximately 1.5 cm.  It was felt that this could be resected without the need of chest wall reconstruction because of the narrow stalk.
Therefore a 2nd port was placed in the anterior axillary line approximately 8th intercostal space in the usual fashion.  Camera was placed through this port.  Laparoscopic scissors were placed through the posterior port, but it was necessary to have another instrument to provide more tension than just gravity.  Therefore because of the need to bring the specimen through the chest wall, a small 3-cm thoracotomy was made, which incorporated the posterior port site.  This was taken down to the subcutaneous tissue with Bovie electrocautery.  Periosteal elevator was used to lift the intercostal muscle off.  The ribs were not spread.  Through this 3-cm incision, both the laparoscopic scissors as well as Prestige graspers could be placed.  Prestige graspers were used to pull the specimen from the chest wall.  Care was taken not to injure the capsule.  The laparoscopic scissors on cautery were used to resect the parietal pleural off of the chest wall.  Care was taken not to transect the stalk.  Specimen came off the chest wall very easily.  There was good hemostasis.
At this point, the EndoCatch bag was placed through the incision.  Specimen was placed in the bag and then removed from the field.  There was good hemostasis.  Camera was removed.  A 24-French chest tube was placed through the anterior port and secured with 2-0 silk suture.  The posterior port site was closed 1st with 2-0 Vicryl in a running fashion for the intercostal muscle layer, followed by 2-0 closure of the latissimus fascia as well as subdermal suture, 4-0 Monocryl was used for the skin, followed by Steri-Strips and sterile drapes.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, was extubated in the operating room and returned to the recovery room in stable condition.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the surgery?

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Thrombosed left forearm loop fistula graft.
2.  Chronic renal failure.
3.  Hyperkalemia.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Thrombosed left forearm loop fistula graft.
2.  Chronic renal failure.
3.  Hyperkalemia.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
Thrombectomy of the left forearm loop graft.
ANESTHESIA:
Local with sedation.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
Less than 5 cc.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
OPERATIVE FINDINGS:
The venous outflow was good.  There was stenosis in the mid-venous limb of the graft.
INDICATIONS:
The patient is an 81-year-old African-American female who presents with an occluded left forearm loop graft.  She was not able to have her dialysis as routine.  Her potassium was dramatically elevated at 7 the initial evening of anticipated surgery.  Both Surgery and Anesthesia thought this would be too risky to do.  Thus, she was given medications to decrease her potassium and a temporary hemodialysis catheter was placed in the femoral vein noted for her to have dialysis that night as well as this morning.  This morning her predialysis potassium was 6, and thus she was scheduled for surgery after her dialysis.
PROCEDURE:
The patient was taken to the operative suite and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A transverse incision was made at the region of the venous anastomosis of the graft.  Further dissection was carried down to the catheter.  The vein appeared to be soft and without thrombus.  This outflow did not appear to be significantly impaired.  A transverse incision was made with a #11 blade on the venous limb of the graft near the anastomosis.  Next, a thrombectomy was done using a #4 Fogarty catheter.  Some of the clot and thrombus was removed from the venous limb.  The balloon did hang up in the multiple places along the venous limb signifying some degree of stenosis.  Once removing most of the clots from the venous limb prior to removing the plug, dilators were passed down the venous limb also indicating the area of stenosis.  At this point, we felt the patient would benefit from a curettage of the venous limb of the graft.  This was done and subsequent passes with the dilator and the balloon were then very easy and smooth following the curettage.  The Fogarty balloon was then passed beyond the clot and the plug.  The plug was visualized and inspected.  This also gave a good brisk bleeding from the graft.  The patient was heparinized and hep saline solution was injected into the venous limb and the angle vascular clamp was applied to the venous limb.  Attention was directed up to its anastomosis and the vein.  Fogarty balloon and thrombectomy was also performed well enough into this way.  There was good venous back bleeding following this.  The area was checked for any stenosis with the dilators and none was present.  Next, a #6-0 Prolene suture was used in a running fashion to close the graft.  Just prior to tying the suture, the graft was allowed to flush to move any debris or air.  The suture was also checked at that point for augmentation, which was good.  The suture was tied down and the wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution.  Next, a #3-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the subcutaneous tissues and a #4-0 undyed Vicryl was used in a running subcuticular fashion to approximate the skin edges.  Steri-Strips were applied and the patient was taken to recovery in stable condition.  She tolerated the procedure well.  She will be discharged from recovery when stable.  She is to resume her regular dialysis schedule and present for dialysis tomorrow.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling?

[patient] yes, i do. my graft was blocked, and i was not able to have my dialysis as usual.
[doctor] that's correct. your potassium level was also high, which made it risky to do the procedure right away. so, you had to have a temporary hemodialysis catheter placed in your femoral vein for dialysis. how did it all go?
[patient] it went well. i was able to have dialysis last night and this morning before my procedure.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Malignant pleural effusion, left, with dyspnea.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Malignant pleural effusion, left, with dyspnea.
PROCEDURE:
Thoracentesis, left.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
The patient was brought to the recovery area of the operating room.  After obtaining the informed consent, the patient's posterior left chest wall was prepped and draped in usual fashion.  Xylocaine 1% was infiltrated above the seventh intercostal space in the midscapular line.  Initially, I tried to use the thoracentesis set after 1% Xylocaine had been infiltrated, but the needle of the system was just too short to reach the pleural cavity due to the patient's very thick chest wall.  Therefore, I had to use a #18 spinal needle, which I had to use almost in its entire length to reach the fluid.  From then on, I proceeded manually to withdraw 2000 mL of a light milky fluid.
The patient tolerated the procedure fairly well, but almost at the end of it she said that she was feeling like fainting and therefore we carefully withdrew the needle.  At that time, it was getting difficult to withdraw fluid anyway and we allowed her to lie down and after a few minutes the patient was feeling fine.  At any rate, we gave her bolus of 250 mL of normal saline and the patient returned to her room for additional hours of observation.  We then thought that if she was doing fine, then we will send her home.
A chest x-ray was performed after the procedure which showed a dramatic reduction of the amount of pleural fluid and then there was no pneumothorax or no other obvious complications of her procedure.
","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after the thoracentesis procedure?
[patient] i'm feeling okay, a little tired but okay.
[doctor] that's understandable. i just wanted to check in and make sure there are no complications after the procedure. how is your breathing now?
[patient] it's a little easier than before the procedure, but still a little labored.
[doctor] okay, well that's to be expected. we removed about 2000 ml of fluid from your left pleural cavity, which should help alleviate some of your symptoms. however, you may still feel some discomfort and shortness of breath for a little while longer.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] we did notice that towards the end of the procedure, you mentioned feeling faint. can you tell me a little bit more about that?

"OPERATION,1.  Insertion of a left subclavian Tesio hemodialysis catheter.
2.  Surgeon-interpreted fluoroscopy.
OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, patient was taken to the operating room and MAC anesthesia was administered.  Next, the patient's chest and neck were prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  Lidocaine 1% was used to infiltrate the skin in the region of the procedure.  Next a #18-gauge finder needle was used to locate the left subclavian vein.  After aspiration of venous blood, Seldinger technique was used to thread a J wire through the needle.  This process was repeated.  The 2 J wires and their distal tips were confirmed to be in adequate position with surgeon-interpreted fluoroscopy.  Next, the subcutaneous tunnel was created.  The distal tips of the individual Tesio hemodialysis catheters were pulled through to the level of the cuff.  A dilator and sheath were passed over the individual J wires.  The dilator and wire were removed, and the distal tip of the Tesio hemodialysis catheter was threaded through the sheath, which was simultaneously withdrawn.  The process was repeated.  Both distal tips were noted to be in good position.  The Tesio hemodialysis catheters were flushed and aspirated without difficulty.  The catheters were secured at the cuff level with a 2-0 nylon.  The skin was closed with 4-0 Monocryl.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the PACU in good condition.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?

[patient] sure, uh, i was given mac anesthesia and my chest and neck were prepped and draped. they used lidocaine to numb the area and then used a #18-gauge finder needle to locate my left subclavian vein. then, they used the seldinger technique to thread two j wires through the needle. they used fluoroscopy to confirm that the wires were in place. after that, a subcutaneous tunnel was created and the individual tesio catheters were pulled through. they flushed and aspirated the catheters, secured them with nylon, and closed my skin with monocryl.
[doctor] okay, that sounds about right. did you experience any complications during or after the procedure?
[patient] no, um, everything went smoothly. i was transferred to the pacu and monitored for a bit before being released.
[doctor] great. well, it sounds like everything went well. is there anything else you'd like to discuss or any questions you have?
[patient] no, i think i'm good for now. thank you.
[doctor] you're welcome. don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or questions in the future.",1
"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Headaches, question of temporal arteritis.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Headaches, question of temporal arteritis.
PROCEDURE:
Bilateral temporal artery biopsies.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
After obtaining an informed consent, the patient was brought to the operating room where her right temporal area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Xylocaine 1% was utilized and then an incision was made in front of the right ear and deepened anteriorly.  The temporal artery was found and exposed in an extension of about 2 cm.  The artery was proximally and distally ligated with 6-0 Prolene and also a side branch and a sample was sent for pathology.  Hemostasis achieved with a cautery and the incision was closed with a subcuticular suture of Monocryl.
Then, the patient was turned and her left temporal area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A similar procedure was performed with 1% Xylocaine and exposed her temporal artery, which was excised in an extent to about 2 cm.  This was also proximally and distally ligated with 6-0 Prolene and also side branch.  Hemostasis was achieved with a cautery and the skin was closed with a subcuticular suture of Monocryl.
Dressings were applied to both areas.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Estimated blood loss was negligible, and the patient went back to Same Day Surgery for recovery.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] i'm feeling okay, a bit sore where the incisions were made.
[doctor] that's normal. so, the reason for the procedure was to investigate whether or not you have temporal arteritis, which is a condition that causes headaches. we took biopsies of both your temporal arteries and sent them to pathology for analysis. it will take a few days to get the results. 
[patient] okay, i understand. will i need to take any medications or follow any specific instructions in the meantime?
[doctor] for now, just take it easy and avoid any activities that may strain the areas where the incisions were made. you can take over-the-counter pain relievers if needed. we will discuss further treatment options once we receive the results of the biopsy. 
[patient] alright, i'll take it easy. thank you, doctor.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Right buccal space infection and abscess tooth #T.
PROCEDURE:
Extraction of tooth #T and incision and drainage (I&D) of right buccal space infection.
ANESTHESIA:
General, oral endotracheal tube.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
SPECIMENS:
Aerobic and anaerobic cultures were sent.
IV FLUID:
150 mL.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
10 mL.
PROCEDURE:
The patient was brought to the operating room, placed on the table in a supine position, and after demonstration of an adequate plane of general anesthesia via the oral endotracheal route, the patient was prepped and draped in the usual fashion for an intraoral procedure.  Gauze throat pack was placed and the right buccal vestibule was palpated and area of the abscess was located.  The abscess cavity was aspirated using a 5 mL syringe with an 18-gauge needle.  Approximately 1 mL of purulent material was aspirated that was placed on aerobic and anaerobic cultures.  Culture swabs and the tooth sent to the laboratory for culture and sensitivity testing.
The area in the buccal vestibule was then opened with approximately 1-cm incision.  Blunt dissection was then used to open up the abscess cavity and explore the abscess cavity.  A small amount of additional purulence was drained from it, approximately 1 mL and at this point, tooth #T was extracted by forceps extraction.  Periosteal elevator was used to explore the area near the extraction site.  This was continuous with abscess cavity, so the abscess cavity was allowed to drain into the extraction site.  No drain was placed.  Upon completion of the procedure, the throat pack was removed.  The pharynx was suctioned.  The stomach was also suctioned and the patient was then awakened, extubated, and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling?

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Left pleural effusion.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Left hemothorax.
PROCEDURE:
Thoracentesis.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After obtaining informed consent and having explained the procedure to the patient, he was sat at the side of a stretcher in the emergency department.  His left back was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Xylocaine 1% was used to infiltrate his chest wall and the chest entered upon the ninth intercostal space in the midscapular line and the thoracentesis catheter was used and placed, and then we proceed to draw by hand about 1200 mL blood.  This blood was nonclotting and it was tested twice.  Halfway during the procedure, the patient felt that he was getting dizzy and his pressure at that time had dropped to the 80s.  Therefore, we laid him off his right side while keeping the chest catheter in place.  At that time, I proceeded to continuously draw fluids slowly and then when the patient recovered we sat him up again and we proceed to complete the procedure.
Overall besides the described episode, the patient tolerated the procedure well and afterwards, we took another chest x-ray that showed much improvement in the pleural effusion and at that particular time, with all the history we proceeded to admit the patient for observation and with an idea to obtain a CT in the morning to see whether the patient would need an pigtail intrapleural catheter or not.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling?
[patient] not so good, doctor. i have been experiencing some left back pain and difficulty breathing.
[doctor] okay, let me take a look. after examining you, it appears that you have some fluid buildup in your left lung. we need to remove this fluid to relieve your symptoms. i am going to perform a procedure called a thoracentesis. 
[patient] what is that?
[doctor] we will insert a needle into your chest to remove the excess fluid. it is a simple procedure and you will be awake for it. but before we proceed, i need you to sign a consent form.
[patient] okay, i agree.
[doctor] great. now, let's get started. we will numb the area with a local anesthetic and then insert a catheter into your chest to remove the fluid. during the procedure, we did encounter some bleeding, and the blood was tested twice to ensure it was not a problem. we removed about 1200 ml of blood. about halfway through the procedure, you reported feeling dizzy and your blood pressure dropped. we laid you on your right side, and after you recovered, we completed the procedure. you did well overall, and after the procedure, we took another chest x-ray that showed much improvement.
[patient] do i need to stay in the hospital?
[doctor] yes, we want to keep you for observation for now. we will obtain a ct scan in the morning to see if you need an intrapleural catheter or not. don't worry, we will take good care of you.","[doctor] hey there, how are you feeling today?
[patient] um, not great, doc. i've been having some left back pain and trouble breathing.
[doctor] alright, let me have a look-see. oh, it looks like you've got some fluid buildup in your left lung. to help relieve your symptoms, we'll need to remove the fluid. we'll do a procedure called a thoracentesis. 
[patient] hm, what's that?
[doctor] basically, we'll stick a needle in your chest to get rid of the excess fluid. it's pretty simple and you'll be awake for it. before we can do that, though, i need you to sign a consent form.
[patient] uh-huh, sure thing.
[doctor] perfect. alright, let's get started. we'll numb the area with a local anesthetic and then put a catheter in your chest to remove the fluid. during the procedure, we did notice some bleeding, but we ran some tests and it wasn't a problem. we removed about 1200 ml of fluid. about halfway through, you said you felt dizzy and your blood pressure dropped a bit. we had you lie on your right side for a bit, and after you were okay, we finished the procedure. you did a great job overall, and afterward, we took another chest x-ray that showed a lot of improvement.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
Patient was brought to the operating room, placed on the table in the supine position and after demonstration of an adequate plane of general anesthesia via the oral endotracheal route, patient was prepped and draped in the usual fashion for an intraoral procedure.  In addition, the extraoral area on the left neck was prepped with Betadine and draped accordingly.  Gauze throat pack was placed and local anesthetic was administered in the left lower quadrant, total of 3.4 mL of lidocaine 2% with 1:100,000 epinephrine and Marcaine 1.7 mL of 0.5% with 1:200,000 epinephrine.  An incision was made with #15 blade in the left submandibular area through the skin and blunt dissection was accomplished with curved mosquito hemostat to the inferior border of the mandible.  No purulent drainage was obtained.  The 0.25 inch Penrose drain was then placed in the extraoral incision and it was secured with 3-0 silk suture.  Moving to the intraoral area, periosteal elevator was used to elevate the periosteum from the buccal aspect of tooth #19.  The area did not drain any purulent material.  The carious tooth #19 was then extracted by elevator and forceps extraction.  After the tooth was removed, the 0.25 inch Penrose drain was placed in a subperiosteal fashion adjacent to the extraction site and secured with 3-0 silk suture.  The tube was then repositioned to the left side allowing access to the upper right quadrant where tooth #2 was then extracted by routine elevator and forceps extraction.  After the extraction, the throat pack was removed.  An orogastric tube was then placed by Dr. X, and stomach contents were suctioned.  The pharynx was then suctioned with the Yankauer suction.  The patient was awakened, extubated, and taken to the PACU in stable condition.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?

2.  Tenosynovitis of the left third and fourth fingers at the A1 and A2 pulley level.
3.  Dupuytren's nodule in the palm.
PROCEDURE:
Left carpal tunnel release with flexor tenosynovectomy; cortisone injection of trigger fingers, left third and fourth fingers; injection of Dupuytren's nodule, left palm.
ANESTHESIA:
Local plus IV sedation (MAC).
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
Zero.
SPECIMENS:
None.
DRAINS:
None.
PROCEDURE DETAIL:
Patient brought to the operating room.  After induction of IV sedation the left hand was anesthetized suitable for carpal tunnel release; 10 cc of a mixture of 1% Xylocaine and 0.5% Marcaine was injected in the distal forearm and proximal palm suitable for carpal tunnel surgery.  Routine prep and drape was employed.  Arm was exsanguinated by means of elevation of Esmarch elastic tourniquet and tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg pressure.  Hand was positioned palm up in the lead hand-holder.  A short curvilinear incision about the base of the thenar eminence was made.  Skin was sharply incised.  Sharp dissection was carried down to the transverse carpal ligament and this was carefully incised longitudinally along its ulnar margin.  Care was taken to divide the entire length of the transverse retinaculum including its distal insertion into deep palmar fascia in the midpalm.  Proximally the antebrachial fascia was released for a distance of 2-3 cm proximal to the wrist crease to insure complete decompression of the median nerve.  Retinacular flap was retracted radially to expose the contents of the carpal canal.  Median nerve was identified, seen to be locally compressed with moderate erythema and mild narrowing.  Locally adherent tenosynovium was present and this was carefully dissected free.  Additional tenosynovium was dissected from the flexor tendons, individually stripping and peeling each tendon in sequential order so as to debulk the contents of the carpal canal.  Epineurotomy and partial epineurectomy were carried out on the nerve in the area of mild constriction to relieve local external scarring of the epineurium.  When this was complete retinacular flap was laid loosely in place over the contents of the carpal canal and skin only was closed with interrupted 5-0 nylon horizontal mattress sutures.  A syringe with 3 cc of Kenalog-10 and 3 cc of 1% Xylocaine using a 25 gauge short needle was then selected; 1 cc of this mixture was injected into the third finger A1 and A2 pulley tendon sheaths using standard trigger finger injection technique; 1 cc was injected into the fourth finger A1/A2 pulley tendon sheath using standard tendon sheath injection technique; 1 cc was injected into the Dupuytren's nodule in the midpalm to relieve local discomfort.  Routine postoperative hand dressing with well-padded, well-molded volar plaster splint and lightly compressive Ace wrap was applied.  Tourniquet was deflated.  Good vascular color and capillary refill were seen to return to the tips of all digits.  Patient discharged to the ambulatory recovery area and from there discharged home.  Discharge medication is Darvocet-N 100, 30 tablets, one to two PO q.4h. p.r.n.  Patient asked to begin gentle active flexion, extension and passive nerve glide exercises beginning 24-48 hours after surgery.  She was asked to keep the dressings clean, dry and intact and follow up in my office.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after your procedure?
[patient] i'm feeling okay, a little sore.
[doctor] that's normal. let's go over what we did. we performed a left carpal tunnel release along with a flexor tenosynovectomy. we also administered a cortisone injection for your trigger fingers in the third and fourth fingers, and an injection for your dupuytren's nodule in the palm. we used local anesthesia with iv sedation for the procedure.
[patient] yes, i remember that much.
[doctor] good. we injected a mixture of 1% xylocaine and 0.5% marcaine in the distal forearm and proximal palm for the carpal tunnel surgery. we made a short incision around the base of your thenar eminence and carefully incised the transverse carpal ligament. we made sure to divide the entire length of the retinaculum and release the antebrachial fascia for a distance of 2-3 cm proximal to the wrist crease to ensure complete decompression of the median nerve.

The patient has undergone previous surgical treatment and had a diagnosis of basal cell nevus syndrome.  Currently our plan is to remove the impacted third molar teeth, to remove a cystic lesion left posterior mandible, to remove 4 second bicuspid teeth as requested by her orthodontist, and to weaken and her maxilla to allow expansion by a modified Le Fort osteotomy.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
The patient was brought into the operating room, placed on the operating table in supine position.  Following treatment under adequate general anesthesia via the orotracheal route, the patient was prepped and draped in a manner consistent with intraoral surgical procedures.  The oral cavity was suctioned, was drained of fluid and a throat pack was placed.  General anesthesia nursing service was notified and which was removed at the end of the procedure.  Lidocaine 1% with epinephrine concentration in 1:100,000 was injected into the labial vestibule of the maxilla bilaterally as well as the lateral areas associated with the extractions sites in lower jaw and the left posterior mandible for a total of 11 mL.  A Bovie electrocautery was utilized to make a vestibular incision, beginning in the second molar region of the maxilla superior to the mucogingival junction extending to the area of the cuspid teeth.  Subperiosteal dissection revealed lateral aspect of the maxilla immediately posterior to the second molar tooth where the third molar tooth was identified and was bony crypt.  Following use of Cerebromaxillary osteotome, elevated, and underwent complete removal of the dental follicle.  Secondly, tooth number 4 was removed.  Tooth number 13 was removed, and the opposite third molar tooth was removed through an identical incision on the opposite side.  Surgeon then utilized a #15 saw to make a horizontal osteotomy through the lateral aspect of the maxilla from the target plates, anteriorly to the area of the buttress region cross the anterior maxilla to a point adjacent to the piriform rim, 5 mm superior to the nasal floor, bilaterally Cerebromaxillary osteotome utilized to separate the maxilla from the target placed posteriorly and a 5 mm Tessier osteotome through a vertical incision anteriorly between roots of teeth numbers 8 and 9.  This resulted in the alternate mobilization of the two halves of the maxilla, or to allow expansion.  These wounds were all irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline and with antibiotic containing solution, closed with 3-0 chromic suture in running fashion for watertight closure.  Attention was directed to the mandible where the left posterior mandible was approached through a lateral vestibular incision overlying the external oblique ridge and brought anteriorly in an old scar.  The surgeons utilized cautery osteotome to identify a cystic lesion associated with the left posterior mandible, which was approximately 1 cm in width and 2.5 to 3 cm in vertical dimension immediately adjacent to the neurovascular bundle.  This wound was then irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline and concentrated solution of clindamycin.  Closed primarily with a 3-0 Vicryl suture in running fashion for a watertight closure.  Teeth number 20 and 29 where removed and 3-0 chromic suture placed.  This concluded the procedure.  All cottonoids and other sponges, throat pack were removed.  No complications were encountered.  The aforementioned cystic lesion was sent with specimen no drains were placed.  The blood loss from this procedure was approximately 100 mL.
The patient was returned over the care of the anesthesia where she was extubated in the operating room, taken from the operating room to the recovery room with stable vital signs and spontaneous respirations.","[doctor] hello there, how are you feeling?
[patient] i feel a little groggy but otherwise okay.
[doctor] you just had surgery to remove a cystic lesion in your left posterior mandible, correct?
[patient] yes, that's correct.
[doctor] we also removed a few teeth and performed a modified le fort i osteotomy to weaken your maxilla in order to allow for expansion. the procedure went smoothly and there were no complications. you lost about 100 ml of blood during the surgery, which is normal.
[patient] okay, that's good to hear.
[doctor] you will need to rest for a few days and avoid any strenuous activity. you may experience some discomfort and swelling in your mouth and face, but that should subside within a week or two. we will send the cystic lesion to the lab for further testing, but i will follow up with you in a few weeks to make sure everything is healing properly. do you have any questions or concerns?
[patient] no, i think i understand everything. thank you, doctor.
[doctor] you're welcome. just remember to take it easy and follow the post-operative instructions we gave you.","[doctor] hey there, how ya feeling?
[patient] um, i'm feeling a bit groggy, but not too shabby.
[doctor] so, we removed that cystic lesion from your left posterior mandible, right?
[patient] mm-hmm, yep, that's right.
[doctor] we also took out some teeth and did a thing called a modified le fort i osteotomy to weaken your maxilla, so it could expand. everything went smoothly, no problems. you lost about 100 ml of blood, which is normal.
[patient] okay, good to know.
[doctor] you'll need to take it easy for a bit, no heavy lifting or anything. you might experience some discomfort and swelling in your mouth and face, but that should go away in a week or two. we're sending the cystic lesion to the lab for testing, but i'll check in with you in a few weeks to make sure you're healing alright. any questions or worries?
[patient] nope, i think i got it. thanks a lot, doc.
[doctor] no problem. just remember to rest up and stick to the post-op instructions we gave you.",1
"PROCEDURES:
1.  Placement of SynchroMed infusion pump.
2.  Tunneling of SynchroMed infusion pump catheter,3.  Anchoring of the intrathecal catheter and connecting of the right lower quadrant SynchroMed pump catheter to the intrathecal catheter.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
Under general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was placed in a lateral decubitus position.  The patient was prepped and draped in a sterile manner.  The intrathecal catheter was placed via a percutaneous approach by the pain management specialist at which point an incision was made adjacent to the needle containing the intrathecal catheter.  This incision was carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue to the paraspinous muscle fascia which was cleared around the entry point of the intrathecal catheter needle.  A pursestring suture of 3-0 Prolene was placed around the needle in the paraspinous muscle.  The needle was withdrawn.  The pursestring suture was tied to snug the tissues around the catheter and prevent cerebrospinal fluid leak.  The catheter demonstrated free flow of cerebrospinal fluid,throughout the RV procedure.  The catheter was anchored to the paraspinous muscle with an anchoring device using interrupted sutures of 3-0 Prolene.  Antibiotic irrigation and antibiotic soak sponge were placed into the wound, and the catheter was clamped to prevent persistent leakage of cerebrospinal fluid while the SynchroMed-pump pocket was created.  Then, I turned my attention to the anterior abdominal wall where an oblique incision was made and carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue to the external oblique fascia, which was freed from attachments to the overlying subcutaneous tissue utilizing blunt and sharp dissection with electrocautery.  A pocket was created that would encompass the SynchroMed fusion pump.  A tunneling device was then passed through the subcutaneous tissue from the back incision to the abdominal incision, and a SynchroMed pump catheter was placed to the tunneling device.  The tunneling device was then removed leaving the SynchroMed pump catheter extending from the anterior abdominal wall incision to the posterior back incision.  The intrathecal catheter was trimmed.  A clear plastic boot was placed over the intrathecal catheter, and the connecting device was advanced from the SynchroMed pump catheter into the intrathecal catheter connecting the 2 catheters together.  The clear plastic boot was then placed over the connection, and it was anchored in place with 0-silk ties.  Good CSF was then demonstrated flowing through the SynchroMed pump catheter.  The SynchroMed pump catheter was connected to the SynchroMed pump and anchored in place with a 0-silk tie.  Excess catheter was coiled and placed behind the pump.  The pump was placed into the subcutaneous pocket created for it on the anterior abdominal wall.  The pump was anchored to the anterior abdominal wall fascia with interrupted sutures of 2-0 Prolene; 4 of the sutures were placed.  The subcutaneous tissues were irrigated with normal saline.  The subcutaneous tissue of both wounds was closed with running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin of both wounds was closed with staples.  Antibiotic ointment and a sterile dressing were applied.  The patient was awake and taken to the recovery room.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was stable at the completion of the procedure.  All sponge and lap, needle and instrument counts were correct at the completion of the procedure.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm feeling okay, just a bit sore.
[doctor] that's understandable. i see here that you underwent a procedure to place a synchromed infusion pump. can you tell me a bit about that?
[patient] yes, i had an intrathecal catheter placed via a percutaneous approach, and then the synchromed pump was placed in a pocket in my anterior abdominal wall.
[doctor] i see. and can you explain why the procedure was done?
[patient] the pump is for pain management.
[doctor] okay, and how did the procedure go? did you experience any complications?

COMPLICATIONS:
None.
FINDINGS:
Products of conception consistent with a 6-week intrauterine pregnancy.
INDICATIONS:
The patient is a 28-year-old gravida 4, para 3 female at 13 weeks by her last menstrual period and 6 weeks by an ultrasound today in the emergency room who presents with heavy bleeding starting today.  A workup done in the emergency room revealed a beta-quant level of 1931 and an ultrasound showing an intrauterine pregnancy with a crown-rump length consistent with a 6-week and 2-day pregnancy.  No heart tones were visible.  On examination in the emergency room, a moderate amount of bleeding was noted.
Additionally, the cervix was noted to be 1 cm dilated.  These findings were discussed with the patient and options including surgical management via dilation and curettage versus management with misoprostol versus expected management were discussed with the patient.  After discussion of these options, the patient opted for a suction, dilation, and curettage.  The patient was described to the patient in detail including risks of infection, bleeding, injury to surrounding organs including risk of perforation.  Informed consent was obtained prior to proceeding with the procedure.
PROCEDURE NOTE:
The patient was taken to the operating room where spinal anesthesia was administered without difficulty.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion in lithotomy position.  A weighted speculum was placed.  The anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with a single tooth tenaculum.  At this time, a 7-mm suction curettage was advanced into the uterine cavity without difficulty and was used to suction contents of the uterus.  Following removal of the products of conception, a sharp curette was advanced into the uterine cavity and was used to scrape the four walls of the uterus until a gritty texture was noted.  At this time, the suction curette was advanced one additional time to suction any remaining products.  All instruments were removed.  Hemostasis was visualized.  The patient was stable at the completion of the procedure.  Sponge, lap, and instrument counts were correct.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the procedure?

OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After obtaining informed consent from the patient's family, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  Next, the neck and chest were prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  A #10-blade scalpel was used to make an incision in the area of the xiphoid process.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the fascia using Bovie electrocautery.  The xiphoid process was elevated, and the diaphragmatic attachments to it were dissected free.  Next the pericardium was identified.
The pericardium was opened with Bovie electrocautery.  Upon entering the pericardium, serous fluid was expressed.  In total, ** cc of fluid was drained.  A pericardial biopsy was obtained.  The fluid was sent off for cytologic examination as well as for culture.  A #24 Blake chest drain was brought out through the skin and placed in the posterior pericardium.  The fascia was closed with #1 Vicryl followed by 2-0 Vicryl followed by 4-0 PDS in a running subcuticular fashion.  Sterile dressing was applied.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the procedure?

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Symptomatic pericardial effusion.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Symptomatic pericardial effusion.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
Subxiphoid pericardiotomy.
ANESTHESIA:
General via ET tube.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
50 cc.
FINDINGS:
This is a 70-year-old black female who underwent a transhiatal esophagectomy in November of 2003.  She subsequently had repeat chest x-rays and CT scans and was found to have a moderate pericardial effusion.  She had the appropriate inflammatory workup for pericardial effusion, however, it was nondiagnostic.  Also, during that time, she had become significantly more short of breath.  A dobutamine stress echocardiogram was performed, which was negative with the exception of the pericardial effusions.  She had no tamponade physiology.
INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE:
For therapeutic and diagnostic management of this symptomatic pericardial effusion.  Risks, benefits, and alternative measures were discussed with the patient.  Consent was obtained for the above procedure.
PROCEDURE:
The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 4 cm incision was created in the midline above the xiphoid.  Dissection was carried down through the fascia and the xiphoid was resected.  The sternum was retracted superiorly the pericardium was identified and pericardial fat was cleared off the pericardium.  An #0 silk suture was then placed into the pericardium with care taken not to enter the underlying heart.
This suture was used to retract the pericardium and the pericardium was nicked with #15 blade under direct visualization.  Serous fluid exited through the pericardium and was sent for culture, cytology, and cell count etc.  A section of pericardium was taken approximately 2 cm x 2 cm x 2 cm and was removed.  The heart was visualized and appeared to be contracting well with no evidence of injury to the heart.  The pericardium was then palpated.  There was no evidence of studding.  A right angle chest tube was then placed in the pericardium along the diaphragmatic of the pericardium and then brought out though a small skin incision in the epigastrium.  It was sewn into place with #0 silk suture.  There was some air leak of the left pleural cavity, so a right angle chest tube was placed in the left pleural cavity and brought out through a skin nick in the epigastrium.  It was sewn in the similar way to the other chest tube.  Once again, the area was inspected and found to be hemostatic and then closed with #0 Vicryl suture for fascial stitch, then #3-0 Vicryl suture in the subcutaneous fat, and then #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Chest tubes were placed on 20 cm of water suction.  The patient was taken to PACU in stable condition.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling? i hope you are doing well.

FINDINGS:
On bimanual exam, the patient has approximately 15-week anteverted, mobile uterus with the cervix that is dilated to approximately 2 cm with multiple blood colts in the vagina.  There was a large amount of tissue obtained on the procedure.
PROCEDURE:
The patient was taken to the operating room where a general anesthetic was administered.  She was then positioned in the dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  Once the anesthetic was found to be adequate, a bimanual exam was performed under anesthetic.  Next, a weighted speculum was placed in the vagina.  The anterior lip of cervix was grasped with the vulsellum tenaculum and due to the patient already being dilated approximately 2 cm, no cervical dilation was needed.  A size 12 straight suction curette was used and connected to the suction and was placed in the cervix and a suction curettage was performed.  Two passes were made with the suction curettage.  Next, a sharp curettage was performed obtaining a small amount of tissue and this was followed by third suction curettage and then a final sharp curettage was performed, which revealed a good uterine cry on all sides of the uterus.  After the procedure, the vulsellum tenaculum was removed.  The cervix was seemed to be hemostatic.  The weighted speculum was removed.  The patient was given 0.25 mg of Methergine IM approximately half-way through the procedure.  After the procedure, a second bimanual exam was performed and the patient's uterus had significantly decreased in size.  It is now approximately eight to ten-week size.  The patient was taken from the operating room in stable condition after she was cleaned.  She will be discharged on today.  She was given Methergine, Motrin, and doxycycline for her postoperative care.  She will follow-up in one week in the office.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the procedure?

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Need for intravenous access.
2.  Status post fall.
3.  Status post incision and drainage of left lower extremity.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
Insertion of right subclavian central venous catheter.
SECOND ANESTHESIA:
Approximately 10 cc of 1% lidocaine.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
Minimal.
INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:
The patient is a 74-year-old white female who presents to ABCD General Hospital after falling down flight of eleven stairs and sustained numerous injuries.  The patient went to OR today for an I&D of left lower extremity degloving injury.  Orthopedics was planning on taking the patient back for serial debridements and need for reliable IV access is requested.
PROCEDURE:
Informed consent was obtained by the patient and her daughter.  All risks and benefits of the procedure were explained and all questions were answered.  The patient was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  After landmarks were identified, approximately 5 cc of 1% lidocaine were injected into the skin and subcuticular tissues and the right neck posterior head of the sternocleidomastoid.  Locator needle was used to correctly cannulate the right internal jugular vein.  Multiple attempts were made and the right internal jugular vein was unable to be cannulized.
Therefore, we prepared for a right subclavian approach.  The angle of the clavicle was found and a #22 gauge needle was used to anesthetize approximately 5 cc of 1% lidocaine in skin and subcuticular tissues along with the periosteum of the clavicle.  A Cook catheter needle was then placed and ________ the clavicle in the orientation aimed toward the sternal notch.  The right subclavian vein was then accessed.  A guidewire was placed with a Cook needle and then the needle was subsequently removed and a #11 blade scalpel was used to nick the skin.  A dilator sheath was placed over the guidewire and subsequently removed.  The triple lumen catheter was then placed over the guidewire and advanced to 14 cm.  All ports aspirated and flushed.  Good blood return was noted and all ports were flushed well.  The triple lumen catheter was then secured at 14 cm using #0 silk suture.  A sterile dressing was then applied.  A stat portable chest x-ray was ordered to check line placement.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?
[patient] i'm okay, a bit sore from the fall.
[doctor] i understand, you've been through a lot. i wanted to talk to you about the procedure we performed on you today.
[patient] sure, what procedure?
[doctor] we inserted a catheter into your right subclavian vein to allow us to administer medications and fluids easily. it was necessary because you will need reliable iv access for the debridement of your left lower extremity injury. 
[patient] okay, i see. 
[doctor] we obtained informed consent and explained all the risks and benefits beforehand. after prepping and draping the area, we injected some lidocaine to numb the skin and subcutaneous tissue. we tried to cannulate your right internal jugular vein, but multiple attempts failed.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
Thirty ml.
DRAINS:
Gastrostomy tube was placed to Foley.
SPECIMENS:
None.
FINDINGS:
Stomach located high in the peritoneal cavity. Multiple adhesions around the stomach to the diaphragm and liver.
HISTORY:
The patient is a 59-year-old black male who is indigent, an ethanol and tobacco abuse. He presented initially to the emergency room with throat and bleeding. Following evaluation by ENT and biopsy, it was determined to be squamous cell carcinoma of the right tonsil and soft palate, The patient is to undergo radiation therapy and possibly chemotherapy and will need prolonged enteral feeding with a bypass route from the mouth. The malignancy was not obstructing. Following obtaining informed consent for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube with possible conversion to open procedure, we elected to proceed following diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma and election for radiation therapy.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
The patient was placed in the supine position and general endotracheal anesthesia was induced. Preoperatively, 1 gram of Ancef was given. The abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. After anesthesia was achieved, an endoscope was placed down into the stomach, and no abnormalities were noted. The stomach was insufflated with air and the endoscope was positioned in the midportion and directed towards the anterior abdominal wall. With the room darkened and intensity turned up on the endoscope, a light reflex was noted on the skin of the abdominal wall in the left upper quadrant at approximately 2 fingerbreadths inferior from the most inferior rib. Finger pressure was applied to the light reflex with adequate indentation on the stomach wall on endoscopy. A 21-gauge 1-1/2 inch needle was initially placed at the margin of the light reflex, and this was done twice. Both times it was not visualized on the endoscopy. At this point, repositioning was made and, again, what was felt to be adequate light reflex was obtained, and the 14-gauge angio catheter was placed. Again, after two attempts, we were unable to visualize the needle in the stomach endoscopically. At this point, decision was made to convert the procedure to an open Stamm gastrostomy.
OPEN STAMM GASTROSTOMY:
A short upper midline incision was made and deepened through the subcutaneous tissues. Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery. The linea alba was identified and incised, and the peritoneal cavity was entered. The abdomen was explored. Adhesions were lysed with electrocautery under direct vision. The stomach was identified, and a location on the anterior wall near the greater curvature was selected. After lysis of adhesions was confirmed, we sufficiently moved the original chosen site without tension. A pursestring suture of #3-0 silk was placed on the interior surface of the stomach, and a second #3-0 pursestring silk stitch was placed exterior to that pursestring suture. An incision was then made at the location of the anterior wall which was near the greater curvature and was dissected down to the anterior abdominal wall. A Vanderbilt was used to pass through the abdominal wall in through the skin and then returned to the level of the skin and pulled the Bard feeding tube through the anterior wall into the field. An incision in the center of the pursestring suture on the anterior surface of the stomach was then made with electrocautery. The interior pursestring suture was sutured into place in such a manner as to inkwell the stomach around the catheter. The second outer concentric pursestring suture was then secured as well and tied to further inkwell the stomach. The stomach was then tacked to the anterior abdominal wall at the catheter entrance site with four #2-0 silk sutures in such a manner as to prevent leakage or torsion. The catheter was then secured to the skin with two #2-0 silk sutures. Hemostasis was checked and the peritoneal cavity was washed out and brought to the surgical field. Prior to the initiation of the gastrotomy, the bowel was run and at that time there was noted to be one incidental colotomy. This was oversewn with three #4-0 silk Lembert sutures. At the completion of the operation, the fascia was closed with #1 interrupted Vicryl suture, and the skin was closed with staples. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the postanesthesia care unit in stable condition.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] a little groggy, but i think i'm okay.
[doctor] great. i just wanted to go over some details of the surgery with you. so, we attempted to place a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube, but after two attempts, we were unable to visualize the needle in the stomach endoscopically. we then had to convert the procedure to an open stamm gastrostomy.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Severe neurologic or neurogenic scoliosis.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Severe neurologic or neurogenic scoliosis.
PROCEDURES:
1.  Anterior spine fusion from T11-L3.
2.  Posterior spine fusion from T3-L5.
3.  Posterior spine segmental instrumentation from T3-L5, placement of morcellized autograft and allograft.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
500 mL.
FINDINGS:
The patient was found to have a severe scoliosis.  This was found to be moderately corrected.  Hardware was found to be in good positions on AP and lateral projections using fluoroscopy.
INDICATIONS:
The patient has a history of severe neurogenic scoliosis.  He was indicated for anterior and posterior spinal fusion to allow for correction of the curvature as well as prevention of further progression.  Risks and benefits were discussed at length with the family over many visits.  They wished to proceed.
PROCEDURE:
The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  General anesthesia was induced without incident.  He was given a weight-adjusted dose of antibiotics.  Appropriate lines were then placed.  He had a neuromonitoring performed as well.
He was then initially placed in the lateral decubitus position with his left side down and right side up.  An oblique incision was then made over the flank overlying the 10th rib.  Underlying soft tissues were incised down at the skin incision.  The rib was then identified and subperiosteal dissection was performed.  The rib was then removed and used for autograft placement later.
The underlying pleura was then split longitudinally.  This allowed for entry into the pleural space.  The lung was then packed superiorly with wet lap.  The diaphragm was then identified and this was split to allow for access to the thoracolumbar spine.
Once the spine was achieved, subperiosteal dissection was performed over the visualized vertebral bodies.  This required cauterization of the segmental vessels.  Once the subperiosteal dissection was performed to the posterior and anterior extents possible, the diskectomies were performed.  These were performed from T11-L3.  This was over 5 levels.  Disks and endplates were then removed.  Once this was performed, morcellized rib autograft was placed into the spaces.  The table had been previously bent to allow for easier access of the spine.  This was then straightened to allow for compression and some correction of the curvature.
The diaphragm was then repaired as was the pleura overlying the thoracic cavity.  The ribs were held together with #1 Vicryl sutures.  Muscle layers were then repaired using a running #2-0 PDS sutures and the skin was closed using running inverted #2-0 PDS suture as well.  Skin was closed as needed with running #4-0 Monocryl.  This was dressed with Xeroform dry sterile dressings and tape.
The patient was then rotated into a prone position.  The spine was prepped and draped in a standard fashion.
Longitudinal incision was made from T2-L5.  The underlying soft tissues were incised down at the skin incision.  Electrocautery was then used to maintain hemostasis.  The spinous processes were then identified and the overlying apophyses were split.  This allowed for subperiosteal dissection over the spinous processes, lamina, facet joints, and transverse processes.  Once this was completed, the C-arm was brought in, which allowed for easy placement of screws in the lumbar spine.  These were placed at L4 and L5.  The interspaces between the spinous processes were then cleared of soft tissue and ligamentum flavum.  This was done using a rongeur as well as a Kerrison rongeur.  Spinous processes were then harvested for morcellized autograft.
Once all the interspaces were prepared, Songer wires were then passed.  These were placed from L3-T3.
Once the wires were placed, a unit rod was then positioned.  This was secured initially at the screws distally on both the left and right side.  The wires were then tightened in sequence from the superior extent to the inferior extent, first on the left-sided spine where I was operating and then on the right side spine.  This allowed for excellent correction of the scoliotic curvature.
Decortication was then performed and placement of a morcellized autograft and allograft was then performed after thoroughly irrigating the wound with 4 liters of normal saline mixed with bacitracin.  This was done using pulsed lavage.
The wound was then closed in layers.  The deep fascia was closed using running #1 PDS suture, subcutaneous tissue was closed using running inverted #2-0 PDS suture, the skin was closed using #4-0 Monocryl as needed.  The wound was then dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform dry sterile dressings, and tape.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia and taken to the intensive care unit in stable condition.  All instrument, sponge, and needle counts were correct at the end of the case.
The patient will be managed in the ICU and then on the floor as indicated.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling?

"PROCEDURE:
The site was cleaned with antiseptic.  A local anesthetic (2% lidocaine) was given at each site.  A 3 mm punch biopsy was performed in the left calf and left thigh, above the knee.  The site was then checked for bleeding.  Once hemostasis was achieved, a local antibiotic was placed and the site was bandaged.
The patient was not on any anticoagulant medications.  There were also no other medications which would affect the ability to conduct the skin biopsy.  The patient was further instructed to keep the site completely dry for the next 24 hours, after which a new Band-Aid and antibiotic ointment should be applied to the area.  They were further instructed to avoid getting the site dirty or infected.  The patient completed the procedure without any complications and was discharged home.
The biopsy will be sent for analysis.
The patient will follow up with Dr. X within the next two weeks to review her results.","[doctor]: hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient]: hi doctor, i'm feeling fine, thank you.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Depressed anterior table frontal sinus fracture on the right side.
2.  Right nasoorbital ethmoid fracture.
3.  Right orbital blowout fracture with entrapped periorbita.
4.  Nasal septal and nasal pyramid fracture with nasal airway obstruction.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Depressed anterior table frontal sinus fracture on the right side.
2.  Right nasoorbital ethmoid fracture.
3.  Right orbital blowout fracture with entrapped periorbita.
4.  Nasal septal and nasal pyramid fracture with nasal airway obstruction.
OPERATION:
1.  Open reduction and internal plate and screw fixation of depressed anterior table right frontal sinus.
2.  Transconjunctival exploration of right orbital floor with release of entrapped periorbita.
3.  Open reduction of nasal septum and nasal pyramid fracture with osteotomy.
ANESTHESIA:
General endotracheal anesthesia.
PROCEDURE:
The patient was placed in the supine position.  Under affects of general endotracheal anesthesia, head and neck were prepped and draped with pHisoHex solution and draped in the appropriate sterile fashion.  A gull-wing incision was drawn over the forehead scalp.  Hair was removed along the suture line and incision was made to skin and subcutaneous tissue of the scalp down to, but not including the pericranium.  An inferiorly based forehead flap was then elevated to the superior orbital rim.  The depression of the anterior table of the frontal sinus was noted.  An incision was made more posterior creating an inferiorly based pericranial flap.  The supraorbital nerve was axing from the supraorbital foramen and the supraorbital foramen was converted to a groove in order to allow further inferior displacement and positioning of the forehead flap.  These allowed exposure of the medial orbital wall on the right side.  The displaced fractures of the right medial orbital wall were repositioned through coronal approach.
Further reduction of the nose intranasally also allowed the ethmoid fracture to be aligned more appropriately in the medial wall.  The anterior table fracture was satisfactorily reduced.  Multiple 1.3-mm screws and plate fixation were utilized to recontour the anterior forehead.  A mucocele was removed from the frontal sinus and there was no significant destruction of the posterior wall.  A sinus seeker was utilized and passed into the nasofrontal duct without difficulty.  It was felt that the frontal sinus obliteration would not be necessary.
At this point, the pericranial flap was folded in a fan-folded fashion on top of the plate and screw and hardware and fixed in position with the sutures to remain better contour of the forehead.  At this point, the nose was significantly shifted to the left and an open reduction of the nasal fracture was performed by osteotomies, which were made medially, laterally, and percutaneous transverse osteotomy of the nasal bone on the right side.  There is significant depression of the nasal bone on the left side.  A medial osteotomy was performed on the left side mobilizing nasal pyramid satisfactorily.  There is a high septal deviation, which would not allow complete correction of the deviation.  It was felt that this would best be left for a later date.  Open reduction rhinoplasty could be performed with spread of cartilage grafting in order to straighten the septum high dorsally.  Local infiltration anesthesia 1% Xylocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was infiltrated in the conjunctival fornix of the right lower eyelid as well as the inferior orbital rim.  An incision was made in the palpebral conjunctiva and capsular palpebral fascia beneath the tarsal plate preseptal approach to the inferior orbital rim was performed in this fashion.  Dissection proceeded down to the inferior orbital rim and subperiosteal dissection was performed over the orbital floor.  Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  There was entrapped periorbita, which was released to the fractures, which were repositioned, but not fixed in position.  The forced ductions were performed, which demonstrated release of the periorbit satisfactorily.  The conjunctival incision was closed with an interrupted simple 6-0 plain gut suture.  The nasal pyramid was satisfactorily mobilized as well as the nasal septum and brought back to midline position with the help of a Boies elevator for the septum.  The coronal incision was closed with interrupted 3-0 PDS suture for the galea and deep subcutaneous tissue and the skin closed with interrupted surgical staples.  Nose was dressed with Steri-Strips.  Mastisol Orthoplast splint was prepared after the Doyle splints were placed in the nose and secured with 3-0 Prolene suture and the nose packed with two Kennedy Merocel sponges.  A supportive mildly compressive dressing with fluffs, Kerlix, and 4-inch Ace were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was returned to recovery room in satisfactory condition.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling?

[patient] yes, i had a fracture on the right side of my face.
[doctor] that's correct. you had a depressed anterior table frontal sinus fracture on the right side, a right nasoorbital ethmoid fracture, a right orbital blowout fracture with entrapped periorbita, and a nasal septal and nasal pyramid fracture with nasal airway obstruction. during the surgery, we fixed these injuries. we used general endotracheal anesthesia, and you were placed in a supine position.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] we made a gull-wing incision on your forehead scalp and removed the hair along the suture line to expose the depression of the anterior table of the frontal sinus. we then made an inferior flap on your forehead, and we exposed the medial orbital wall on the right side. we were able to reposition the displaced fractures of the right medial orbital wall through a coronal approach. we also reduced the ethmoid fracture by aligning it more appropriately in the medial wall. we were able to satisfactorily reduce the anterior table fracture, and we used multiple screws and plate fixation to recontour the anterior forehead. we also removed a mucocele from the frontal sinus, but there was no significant destruction of the posterior wall, and we used a sinus seeker to pass it into the nasofrontal duct without difficulty. we did not need to obliterate the frontal sinus. we then folded the pericranial flap in a fan-folded fashion on top of the plate and screw hardware and fixed it in position with sutures to maintain a better contour of your forehead. 
[patient] okay, that makes sense so far.
[doctor] we also corrected your nasal septal and nasal pyramid fractures by performing osteotomies on both sides of your nose. this allowed us to mobilize the nasal pyramid satisfactorily, but there is still a high septal deviation that would not allow complete correction of the deviation. we may need to perform open reduction rhinoplasty with spread of cartilage grafting in order to straighten the septum high dorsally at a later date.
[patient] okay, i understand.
[doctor] lastly, we performed a transconjunctival exploration of your right orbital floor by making an incision in the palpebral conjunctiva and capsular palpebral fascia beneath the tarsal plate preseptal approach to the inferior orbital rim. we then performed subperiosteal dissection over the orbital floor and achieved hemostasis with electrocautery. we released the entrapped periorbita and repositioned the fractures, but did not fix them in position. we performed forced ductions to ensure we released the periorbit satisfactorily. we then closed the conjunctival incision with an interrupted simple 6-0 plain gut suture.
[patient] i see.
[doctor] we closed your coronal incision with interrupted 3-0 pds suture for the galea and deep subcutaneous tissue and the skin closed with interrupted surgical staples. we dressed your nose with steri-strips and used a mastisol orthoplast splint after the doyle splints were placed in your nose and secured with 3-0 prolene suture. we packed your nose with two kennedy merocel sponges and applied a supportive mildly compressive dressing with fluffs, kerlix, and 4-inch ace.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Right renal stone.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Right renal stone.
PROCEDURE:
Right shockwave lithotripsy, cystoscopy, and stent removal x2.
ANESTHESIA:
LMA.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
Minimal.  The patient was given antibiotics preoperatively.
HISTORY:
This is a 47-year-old male who presented with right renal stone and right UPJ stone.  The right UPJ stone was removed using ureteroscopy and laser lithotripsy and the stone in the kidney.  The plan was for shockwave lithotripsy.  The patient had duplicated system on the right side.  Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE was discussed.  Options such as watchful waiting, passing the stone on its own, and shockwave lithotripsy were discussed.  The patient wanted to proceed with the shockwave to break the stone into small pieces as possible to allow the stones to pass easily.  Consent was obtained.
DETAILS OF THE OPERATION:
The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in the supine position.  Using Dornier lithotriptor total of 2500 shocks were applied.  Energy levels were slowly started at O2 increased up to 7; gradually the stone seem to have broken into smaller pieces as the number of shocks went up.  The shocks were started at 60 per minute and slowly increased up to 90 per minute.  The patient's heart rate and blood pressure were stable throughout the entire procedure.
After the end of the shockwave lithotripsy the patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion and cystoscopy was done.  Using graspers, the stent was grasped x2 and pulled out, both stents were removed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient was brought to recovery in stable condition.  The plan was for the patient to follow up with us and plan for KUB in about two to three months.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] hi, i am feeling a little sore but otherwise okay.
[doctor] that's normal after a procedure like this. it looks like everything went well. we removed the stone in your kidney using shockwave lithotripsy, and also removed the stent.
[patient] yes, that's what i was told.
[doctor] we used a lithotriptor to apply 2500 shocks to break the stone into smaller pieces to make it easier for you to pass. how is your pain level right now?
[patient] it's about a 5 out of 10.
[doctor] that's understandable. we can give you some pain medication to help manage that. it's important to stay hydrated and strain your urine to make sure you pass all the pieces of the stone.
[patient] okay, i will do that.
[doctor] you will need a follow-up appointment in two to three months for a kub, but for now, just focus on resting and taking care of yourself. if you have any concerns or questions, don't hesitate to call us.
[patient] thank you, i appreciate it.
[doctor] you're welcome. take care.","[doctor] hey there. so, how's the soreness? feeling any better since the procedure?
[patient] hey doc, um yeah, still pretty sore, but hanging in there.
[doctor] yeah, it's totally normal to feel that way after a procedure like this. sounds like we got everything taken care of though. we removed the stone from your kidney using shockwave lithotripsy and also took out the stent.

Partial proximal obstruction, patent distal system.
TITLE OF OPERATION:
Endoscopic proximal and distal shunt revision with removal of old valve and insertion of new.
SPECIMENS:
None.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
ANESTHESIA:
General.
SKIN PREPARATION:
Chloraprep.
INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION:
Headaches, irritability, slight increase in ventricle size.  Preoperatively patient improved with Diamox.
BRIEF NARRATIVE OF OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:
After satisfactory general endotracheal tube anesthesia was administered, the patient was positioned on the operating table in the supine position with the head rotated towards the left.  The right frontal area and right retroauricular area was shaved and then the head, neck, chest and abdomen were prepped and draped out in the routine manner.  The old scalp incision was opened with a Colorado needle tip and the old catheter was identified as we took the Colorado needle tip over the existing ventricular catheter, right over the sleeve on top of it and when that was entered, the CSF poured out around the ventricular catheter.  The ventricular catheter was then disconnected from the reservoir and endoscopically explored.  We saw it was blocked up proximally.  The catheter was a little adherent and required some freeing up with coagulation and on twisting of the ventricular catheter, I was able to free up the ventricular catheter, and endoscopically inserted a new Bactiseal ventricular catheter.  The catheter went down to the septum and I could see both the right and left lateral ventricles and elected to pass it into the right lateral ventricle.  It irrigated out well.  There was minimal amount of bleeding, but not significant.  The distal catheter system was tested.  There was good distal run off.  Therefore, a linear skin incision was made in the retroauricular area.  Tunneling was performed between the two incisions and a ProGAV valve set to an opening pressure of 10 with a 1-5 shunt assist was brought through the subgaleal tissue, connected to the distal catheter and a flushing reservoir was interposed between the burr hole site ventricular catheter and the ProGAV valve.  All connections were secured with 2-0 Ethibond sutures.  Careful attention was made to make sure that the ProGAV was in the right orientation.  The wounds were irrigated out with Bacitracin, closed in a routine manner using Vicryl for the deep layers and Monocryl for the skin, followed by Mastisol and Steri-Strips.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He was awakened, extubated and taken to recovery room in satisfactory condition.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after the procedure?

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Severe degenerative joint disease of the right shoulder.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Severe degenerative joint disease of the right shoulder.
PROCEDURE:
Right shoulder hemi-resurfacing using a size 5 Biomet Copeland humeral head component, noncemented.
ANESTHESIA:
General endotracheal.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
Less than 100 mL.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.  The patient was taken to Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.
INDICATIONS:
The patient is a 55-year-old female who has had increased pain in to her right shoulder.  X-rays as well as an MRI showed a severe arthritic presentation of the humeral head with mild arthrosis of the glenoid.  She had an intact rotator cuff being at a young age and with potential of glenoid thus it was felt that a hemi-resurfacing was appropriate for her right shoulder focusing in the humeral head.  All risks, benefits, expectations and complications of surgery were explained to her in detail including nerve and vessel damage, infection, potential for hardware failure, the need for revision surgery with potential of some problems even with surgical intervention.  The patient still wanted to proceed forward with surgical intervention.  The patient did receive 1 g of Ancef preoperatively.
PROCEDURE:
The patient was taken to the operating suite, placed in supine position on the operating table.  The Department of anesthesia administered a general endotracheal anesthetic, which the patient tolerated well.  The patient was moved to a beach chair position.  All extremities were well padded.  Her head was well padded to the table.  Her right upper extremity was draped in sterile fashion.  A saber incision was made from the coracoid down to the axilla.  Skin was incised down to the subcutaneous tissue, the cephalic vein was retracted as well as all neurovascular structures were retracted in the case.  Dissecting through the deltopectoral groove, the subscapularis tendon was found as well as the bicipital tendon, 1 finger breadth medial to the bicipital tendon an incision was made.  Subscapularis tendon was released.  The humeral head was brought in to; there were large osteophytes that were removed with an osteotome.  The glenoid then was evaluated and noted to just have mild arthrosis, but there was no need for surgical intervention in this region.  A sizer was placed.  It was felt that size 5 was appropriate for this patient, after which the guide was used to place the stem and pin.  This was placed, after which a reamer was placed along the humeral head and reamed to a size 5.  All extra osteophytes were excised.  The supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons were intact.  Next, the excess bone was removed and irrigated after which reaming of the central portion of the humeral head was performed of which a trial was placed and showed that there was adequate fit and appropriate fixation.  The arm had excellent range of motion.  There are no signs of gross dislocation.  Drill holes were made into the humeral head after which a size 5 Copeland hemi-resurfacing component was placed into the humeral head, kept down in appropriate position, had excellent fixation into the humeral head.  Excess bone that had been reamed was placed into the Copeland metal component, after which this was tapped into position.  After which the wound site was copiously irrigated with saline and antibiotics and the humeral head was reduced and taken through range of motion; had adequate range of motion, full internal and external rotation as well as forward flexion and abduction.  There was no gross sign of dislocation.  Wound site once again it was copiously irrigated with saline antibiotics.  The subscapularis tendon was approximated back into position with #2 Ethibond after which the bicipital tendon did have significant tear to it; therefore it was tenodesed in to the pectoralis major tendon.  After which, the wound site again was irrigated with saline antibiotics after which subcutaneous tissue was approximated with 2-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with staples.  A sterile dressing was placed.  The patient was awakened from general anesthetic and transferred to hospital gurney to the postanesthesia care unit in stable condition.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the procedure?

Portnoy ventricular catheter.
OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:
After satisfactory general endotracheal tube anesthesia was administered, the patient positioned on the operating table in supine position with the right frontal area shaved and the head was prepped and draped in a routine manner.  The old right frontal scalp incision was reopened in a curvilinear manner, and the Bactiseal ventricular catheter was identified as it went into the right frontal horn.  The distal end of the VA shunt was flushed and tested with heparinized saline, found to be patent, and it was then clamped.  Endoscopically, the proximal end was explored and we found debris within the lumen, and then we were able to freely move the catheter around.  We could see along the tract that the tip of the catheter had gone into the surrounding tissue and appeared to have prongs or extensions in the tract, which were going into the catheter consistent with partial proximal obstruction.  A Portnoy ventricular catheter was endoscopically introduced and then the endoscope was bend so that the catheter tip did not go into the same location where it was before, but would take a gentle curve going into the right lateral ventricle.  It flushed in quite well, was left at about 6.5 cm to 7 cm and connected to the existing straight connector and secured with 2-0 Ethibond sutures.  The wounds were irrigated out with Bacitracin and closed in a routine manner using two 3-0 Vicryl for the galea and a 4-0 running Monocryl for the scalp followed by Mastisol and Steri-Strips.  The patient was awakened and extubated having tolerated the procedure well without complications.  It should be noted that the when we were irrigating through the ventricular catheter, fluid easily came out around the catheter indicating that the patient had partial proximal obstruction so that we could probably flow around the old shunt tract and perhaps this was leading to some of the symptomatology or findings of fluid along the chest.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?

Bilateral endoscopic proximal shunt revision and a distal shunt revision.
INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION:
Headaches, full subtemporal site.

Slit ventricle syndrome.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Slit ventricle syndrome.
FINDINGS:
Coaptation of ventricles against proximal end of ventricular catheter.

A Codman Hakim programmable valve with Portnoy ventricular catheter, a 0/20 proGAV valve with a shunt assist of 20 cm dual right-angled connector, and a flushing reservoir.
BRIEF NARRATIVE OF OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:
After satisfactory general endotracheal tube anesthesia was administered, the patient was positioned on the operating table in the prone position with the head held on a soft foam padding.  The occipital area was shaven bilaterally and then the areas of the prior scalp incisions were infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine after routine prepping and draping.  Both U-shaped scalp incisions were opened exposing both the left and the right ventricular catheters as well as the old low pressure reservoir, which might have been leading to the coaptation of the ventricles.  The patient also had a right subtemporal depression, which was full preoperatively.  The entire old apparatus was dissected out.  We then cut both the ventricular catheters and secured them with sutures so that __________ could be inserted.  They were both inspected.  No definite debris were seen.  After removing the ventricular catheters, the old tracts were inspected and we could see where there was coaptation of the ventricles against the ventricular catheter.  On the right side, we elected to insert the Portnoy ventricular catheter and on the left a new Bactiseal catheter was inserted underneath the corpus callosum in a different location.  The old valve was dissected out and the proGAV valve with a 2-0 shunt assist was inserted and secured with a 2-0 Ethibond suture.  The proGAV valve was then connected to a Bactiseal distal tubing, which was looped in a cephalad way and then curved towards the left burr hole site and then the Portnoy catheter on the right was secured with a right-angled sleeve and then interposed between it and the left burr hole site with a flushing reservoir.  All connections secured with 2-0 Ethibond suture and a small piece of Bactiseal tubing between the flushing reservoir and the connector, which secured the left Bactiseal tubing to the two other Bactiseal tubings one being the distal Bactiseal tubing going towards the proGAV valve, which was set to an opening pressure of 8 and the other one being the Bactiseal tubing, which was going towards the flushing reservoir.
All the wounds were irrigated out with bacitracin and then closed in a routine manner using Vicryl for the deep layers and Monocryl for the skin, followed by Mastisol and Steri-Strips.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without complications.  CSF was not sent off.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?

[doctor] during the surgery, we found coaptation of ventricles against the proximal end of ventricular catheter. we also used a codman hakim programmable valve with portnoy ventricular catheter, a 0/20 progav valve with a shunt assist of 20 cm dual right-angled connector, and a flushing reservoir. we had to remove the old apparatus and insert new catheters on both sides. we also inserted a new valve and connected it to a bactiseal distal tubing. we secured all the connections with ethibond sutures and a small piece of bactiseal tubing. we also irrigated your wounds with bacitracin and closed them using vicryl and monocryl.
[patient] okay, i see.
[doctor] you did really well during the surgery, and we didn't find any complications. we didn't send off csf for testing. just make sure to rest and take care of yourself, mm-kay?",1

None.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
Minimal.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
ANESTHESIA:
General endotracheal anesthesia.
CONDITION OF THE PATIENT AT THE END OF THE PROCEDURE:
Stable.  Transferred to the recovery room.
INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:
The patient is a 4-year-old with a history of sebaceous cyst.  The patient is undergoing PE tubes by Dr. X and I was asked to remove the cyst on the right lateral eyebrow.  I saw the patient in my clinic.  I explained to the mother in Spanish the risk and benefits.  Risk included but not limited to risk of bleeding, infection, dehiscence, scarring, need for future revision surgery.  We will proceed with the surgery.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
The patient was taken into the operating room, placed in the supine position.  General anesthetic was administered.  A prophylactic dose of antibiotic was given.  The patient was prepped and draped in a usual manner.  The procedure began by infiltrating lidocaine with epinephrine around the cyst area.  Then, I proceeded with the help of a 15C blade to make an incision and remove a small wedge of tissue that includes a comedo point.  The incision was done superiorly then inferiorly to a full thickness and to the skin down to the cyst.  The cyst was detached of the surrounding structure with the help of blunt dissection.  Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  The wound was closed with 5-0 Vicryl deep dermal interrupted stitches and Dermabond.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without complications and transferred to recovery room in stable condition.  I was present and participated in all aspects of the procedure.  Sponge, needle, and instrument counts were completed at the end of the procedure.","[doctor] hi, how are you doing after your procedure?
[patient] hi, i'm doing okay, just a little sore.
[doctor] that's understandable, you had surgery to remove a sebaceous cyst on your right lateral eyebrow. how is the incision site looking?
[patient] it's still a little red and swollen, but not too bad.
[doctor] okay, that's normal for a few days after the surgery. we used general anesthesia during the procedure and you were transferred to the recovery room in stable condition. you tolerated the procedure well without any complications. how was your experience with the surgery and recovery process?

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS AND INDICATIONS:
Acute non-ST-elevation MI.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS AND SUMMARY:
The patient presented with an acute non-ST-elevation MI.  Despite medical therapy, she continued to have intermittent angina.  Angiography demonstrated the severe LAD as the culprit lesion.  This was treated as noted above with angioplasty alone as the stent could not be safely advanced.  She has residual lesions of 75% in the proximal right coronary and 60% proximal circumflex, and the other residual LAD lesions as noted above.  She will be continued on her medical therapy.  At age 90, she is not a good candidate for aortic valve replacement and coronary bypass grafting.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
Selective coronary angiography, coronary angioplasty.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the cath lab, placed on the table in the supine position.  The area of the right femoral artery was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Using the percutaneous technique, a 6-French sheath was placed in the right femoral artery under fluoroscopic guidance.  With the guidewire in place, a 5-French JL-4 catheter was used to selectively angiogram the left coronary system.  The catheter was removed.  The sheath flushed.  The 5-French 3DRC catheter was then used to selectively angiogram the right coronary artery.  The cath removed, the sheath flushed.
It was decided that intervention was needed in the severe lesions in the LAD, which appeared to be the culprit lesions for the non-ST elevation-MI.  The patient was given a bolus of heparin and an ACT of approximately 50 seconds was obtained, we rebolused and the ACT was slightly lower.  We repeated the level and it was slightly higher.  We administered 500 more units of heparin and then proceeded with an ACT of approximately 270 seconds prior to the 500 units of heparin IV.  Additionally, the patient had been given 300 mg of Plavix orally during the procedure and Integrilin IV bolus and then maintenance drip was started.
A 6-French CLS 3.5 left coronary guide catheter was used to cannulate the left main and HEW guidewire was positioned in the distal LAD and another HEW guidewire in the relatively large third diagonal.  An Apex 2.5 x 15 mm balloon was positioned in the distal portion of the mid LAD stenosis and inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated.  Angiography was then performed, demonstrated marked improvement in the stenosis and this image was used for sizing the last of the needed stent.  The balloon was pulled more proximally and then inflated again at 6 atmospheres for approximately 20 seconds, with the proximal end of the balloon positioned distal to the origin of the third diagonal so as to not compromise the ostium.  The balloon was inflated and removed, repeat angiography performed.  We attempted to advance a Driver 2.5 x 24 mm bare metal stent, but I could not advance it beyond the proximal LAD, where there was significant calcification.  The stent was removed.  Attempts to advance the same 2.5 x 15 mm Apex balloon that was previously used were unsuccessful.  It was removed, a new Apex 2.5 x 15 mm balloon was then positioned in the proximal LAD and inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated and advanced slightly with the distal tip of the balloon proximal to the third diagonal ostium and it was inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated and removed.  Repeat angiography demonstrated no evidence of dissection.  One more attempt was made to advance the Driver 2.5 x 24 mm bare metal stent, but again I could not advance it beyond the calcified plaque in the proximal LAD and this was despite the presence of the buddy wire in the diagonal.  I felt that further attempts in this calcified vessel in a 90-year-old with severe aortic stenosis and severe aortic insufficiency would likely result in complications of dissection, so the stent was removed.  The guidewires and guide cath were removed.  The sheath flushed and sutured into position.  The patient moved to ICU in stable condition with no chest discomfort at all.
CONTRAST:
Isovue-370, 120 mL.
FLUORO TIME:
9.4 minutes.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
30 mL.
HEMODYNAMICS:
Aorta 185/54.
Left ventriculography was not performed.  I did not make an attempt to cross this severely stenotic aortic valve.
The left main is a large vessel, giving rise to LAD and circumflex vessels.  The left main has no significant disease other than calcification in the walls.
The LAD is a moderate-to-large vessel, giving rise to small diagonals and then a moderate-to-large third diagonal, and then a small fourth diagonal.  The LAD has significant calcification proximally.  There is a 50% stenosis between the first and second diagonals that we treated with angioplasty alone in an attempt to be able to advance the stent.  This resulted in a 30% residual, mostly eccentric calcified plaque.  Following this, there was a 50% stenosis in the LAD just after the takeoff of the third diagonal.  This was not ballooned.  Beyond this is an 80% stenosis prior to the fourth diagonal and then a 99% stenosis after the fourth diagonal.  These 2 lesions were dilated with 10% residual prior to the fourth diagonal and 25% residual distal to the fourth diagonal.  As noted above, this area was not stented because I could not safely advance the stent.  Note, there was also a 50% stenosis at the origin of the moderate-to-large third diagonal that did not change with angioplasty.
The circumflex is a large, nondominant vessel consisting of a large obtuse marginal with multiple branches.  The proximal circumflex has an eccentric 60% stenosis prior to the takeoff of the obtuse marginal.  The remainder of the vessel was without significant disease.
The right coronary was a large, dominant vessel giving rise to a large posterior descending artery and small-to-moderate first posterolateral, small second posterolateral, and a small-to-moderate third posterolateral branch.  The right coronary has an eccentric smooth 75% stenosis beginning about a centimeter after the origin of the vessel and prior to the acute marginal branch.  The remainder of the right coronary and its branches were without significant disease.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling?
[patient] i'm feeling okay, but still have some chest discomfort.
[doctor] i see. well, we performed a coronary angiography and angioplasty on you due to an acute non-st-elevation mi. although we were unable to safely advance a stent, we did treat the severe lad as the culprit lesion with angioplasty alone. however, you still have residual lesions of 75% in the proximal right coronary and 60% proximal circumflex, and other residual lad lesions. 
[patient] does that mean i need more treatment?
[doctor] at age 90, you are not a good candidate for aortic valve replacement and coronary bypass grafting. you will be continued on your current medical therapy. we also administered heparin and plavix during the procedure to help with blood clotting.

ANESTHESIA:
General endotracheal anesthesia.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
Approximately 20 mL.
IV FLUIDS:
Include a liter of crystalloid fluid.
URINE OUTPUT:
None.
FINDINGS:
Include that of significantly deviated septum with postoperative changes and a significant septal spur along the floor.  There is also evidence of bilateral internal as well as external nasal valve collapse.
INDICATIONS:
The patient is a pleasant 49-year-old gentleman who had undergone a previous septorhinoplasty after significant trauma in his 20s.  He now presents with significant upper airway resistance and nasal obstruction and is unable to tolerate a CPAP machine.  Therefore, for repair of the above-mentioned deformities including the internal and external nasal valve collapse as well as straightening of the deviated septum, the risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with him included but not limited to bleeding, infection, septal perforation, need for further surgeries, external deformity, and he desired to proceed with surgery.
DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
The patient was taken to the operating room and laid supine upon the OR table.  After the induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the nose was decongested using Afrin-soaked pledgets followed by the injection of % lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine in the submucoperichondrial planes bilaterally.  Examination revealed significant deviation of the nasal septum and the bony cartilaginous junction as well as the large septal spur along the floor.  The caudal septum appeared to be now in adequate position.  There was evidence that there had been a previous caudal septal graft on the right nares and it was decided to leave this in place.  Following the evaluation of the nose, a hemitransfixion incision was made on the left revealing a large septal spur consisting primarily down on the floor of the left nostril creating nearly a picture of the vestibular stenosis on the side.  Very carefully, the mucoperichondrial flaps were elevated over this, and it was excised using an osteotome taking care to preserve the 1.5 cm dorsal and caudal strap of the nasal septum and keep it attached to the nasal spine.  Very carefully, the bony cartilaginous junction was identified and a small piece of the bone, where the spur was, was carefully removed.  Following this, it was noted that the cartilaginous region was satisfactory in quantity as well as quality to perform adequate grafting procedures.  Therefore, attention was turned to harvesting the right-sided auricular cartilage, which was done after the region had adequately been prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Postauricular incision using a #15 blade, the area of the submucoperichondrial plane was elevated in order to preserve the nice lining and identifiable portion of the cartilage taking care to preserve the ridge of the helix at all times.  This was very carefully harvested.  This area had been injected previously with 1% lidocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine.  Following this, the cartilage was removed.  It was placed in saline, noted to be fashioned in the bilateral spreader graft and alar rim graft as well as a small piece of crush which was used to be placed along the top of the dorsal irregularity.  The spreader grafts were sutured in place using submucoperichondrial pockets.  After an external septorhinoplasty approach had been performed and reflection of the skin and soft tissue envelope had been performed, adequately revealing straight septum with significant narrowing with what appeared to be detached perhaps from his ipsilateral cartilages rather from his previous surgery.  These were secured in place in the pockets using a 5-0 PDS suture in a mattress fashion in two places.  Following this, attention was turned to placing the alar rim grafts where pockets were created along the caudal aspect of the lower lateral cartilage and just along the alar margin.  Subsequently, the alar rim grafts were placed and extended all the way to the piriform aperture.  This was sutured in place using a 5-0 self-absorbing gut suture.  The lower lateral cartilage has had some inherent asymmetry.  This may have been related to his previous surgery with some asymmetry of the dome; however, this was left in place as he did not desire any changes in the tip region, and there was adequate support.  An endodermal suture was placed just to reenforce the region using a 5-0 PDS suture.  Following all this, the area was closed using a mattress 4-0 plain gut on a Keith needle followed by the application of ***** 5-0 fast-absorbing gut to close the hemitransfixion incision.  Very carefully, the skin and subcutaneous tissue envelopes were reflected.  The curvilinear incision was closed using a Vicryl followed by interrupted 6-0 Prolene sutures.  The marginal incisions were then closed using 5-0 fast-absorbing gut.  Doyle splints were placed and secured down using a nylon suture.  They had ointment also placed on them.  Following this, nasopharynx was suctioned.  There were no further abnormalities noted and everything appeared to be in nice position.  Therefore, an external splint was placed after the application of Steri-Strips.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He was awakened in the operating room.  He was extubated and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after the surgery?
[patient] hi doctor, honestly a bit groggy still but overall feeling okay.
[doctor] okay, glad to hear that. i just wanted to go over the details of the procedure we performed. we addressed the nasal septal deviation and bilateral internal and external nasal valve collapse that were causing your upper airway resistance and nasal obstruction. we performed a revision septoplasty and used auricular cartilage to repair the internal and external nasal valve collapse. we also harvested right auricular cartilage for the grafting procedures. 
[patient] okay, thank you.

Less than 50 cc.
SPECIMEN:
Portions of bilateral fallopian tubes.
INDICATIONS:
This is a 30-year-old female gravida 4, para-3-0-1-3 who desires permanent sterilization.
FINDINGS:
On bimanual exam, the uterus is small, anteverted, and freely mobile.  There are no adnexal masses appreciated.  On laparoscopic exam, the uterus, bilateral tubes and ovaries appeared normal.  The liver margin and bowel appeared normal.
PROCEDURE:
After consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room where general anesthetic was administered.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  A sterile speculum was placed in the patient's vagina and the anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with a vulsellum tenaculum.  The uterus was then sounded to 7 cm.
The cervix was serially dilated with Hank dilators.  A #20 Hank dilator was left in place.  The sterile speculum was then removed.  Gloves were changed.  Attention was then turned to the abdomen where approximately a 10 mm transverse infraumbilical incision was made through the patient's previous scar.  The Veress needle was placed and gas was turned on.  When good flow and low abdominal pressures were noted, the gas was turned up and the abdomen was allowed to insufflate.  A 11 mm trocar was then placed through this incision and the camera was placed with the above findings noted.  Two 5 mm step trocars were placed, one 2 cm superior to the pubic bone along the midline and the other approximately 7 cm to 8 cm to the left at the level of the umbilicus.  The Endoloop was placed through the left-sided port.  A grasper was placed in the suprapubic port and put through the Endoloop and then a portion of the left tube was identified and grasped with a grasper.  A knuckle of tube was brought up with the grasper and a #0 Vicryl Endoloop synched down across this knuckle of tube.  The suture was then cut using the endoscopic shears.  The portion of tube that was tied off was removed using a Harmonic scalpel.  This was then removed from the abdomen and sent to Pathology.  The right tube was then identified and in a similar fashion, the grasper was placed through the loop of the #0 Vicryl Endoloop and the right tube was grasped with the grasper and the knuckle of tube was brought up into the loop.  The loop was then synched down.  The Endoshears were used to cut the suture.  The Harmonic scalpel was then used to remove that portion of tube.  The portion of the tube that was removed from the abdomen was sent to Pathology.  Both tubes were examined and found to have excellent hemostasis.  All instruments were then removed.  The 5 mm ports were removed with good hemostasis noted.  The camera was removed and the abdomen was allowed to desufflate.  The 11 mm trocar introducer was replaced and the trocar was removed.  The fascia of the infraumbilical incision was reapproximated with an interrupted suture of #3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.  Approximately 10 cc of Marcaine was injected at the incision site.  The vulsellum tenaculum and cervical dilator were then removed from the patient's cervix with excellent hemostasis noted.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct at the end of the procedure.  The patient was taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  She will be discharged home with a prescription for Vicodin for pain and was instructed to follow up in the office in two weeks.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the procedure?

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Stage IV necrotic sacral decubitus.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Stage IV necrotic sacral decubitus.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
Debridement of stage IV necrotic sacral decubitus.
GROSS FINDINGS:
This is a 92-year-old African-American female who was brought into the office 48 hours earlier with a chief complaint of necrotic foul-smelling wound in the sacral region and upon examination was found to have absolutely necrosis of the fat and subcutaneous tissue in the sacral region approximately 15 cm x 15 cm.  A long discussion with the family ensued that it needs to be debrided and then cleaned and then if she cannot keep the stool out of the wound that she will probably need a diverting colostomy.
OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:
The patient was properly prepped and draped under local sedation.  A 0.25% Marcaine was injected circumferentially around the necrotic decubitus.  A wide excision and debridement of the necrotic decubitus taken down to the presacral fascia and all necrotic tissue was electrocauterized and removed.  All bleeding was cauterized with electrocautery and then a Kerlix stack was then placed and a pressure dressing applied.  The patient was sent to recovery in satisfactory condition.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling?
[patient] i'm feeling okay.
[doctor] i wanted to talk to you about the procedure we performed on you. we found a stage iv necrotic sacral decubitus which we had to debride.
[patient] alright, what does that mean?
[doctor] we had to remove the necrotic or dead tissue in the sacral region, which measured around 15cm x 15cm. we used local sedation and injected a 0.25% marcaine to numb the area before we began. we removed all of the necrotic tissue down to the presacral fascia and used electrocautery to stop any bleeding. afterward, we placed a bandage over the area and sent you to recovery.
[patient] is there anything i need to do now?
[doctor] we will monitor your recovery over the next few days. you may need to keep the stool out of the wound, and if that's not possible, we may need to perform a diverting colostomy. we will discuss this further with you and your family. for now, just make sure to keep the area clean and dry.
[patient] understood.
[doctor] if you have any questions or concerns, feel free to let me know.","[doctor] hey there, how ya feeling?
[patient] um, i'm feeling alright.
[doctor] so, i wanted to chat with you about the procedure we did on you. we found this stage iv necrotic sacral decubitus thing that we had to get rid of.
[patient] mm-hmm, okay. what does that mean exactly?
[doctor] basically, we had to remove dead tissue from the sacral region. it was about 15cm x 15cm big. we gave you some local sedation and numbed up the area with some 0.25% marcaine before we got started. we dug out all the dead tissue down to the presacral fascia and used electrocautery to stop any bleeding. after that, we put a bandage on the area and sent you off to recovery.
[patient] alright. is there anything else i need to do?
[doctor] we're gonna keep an eye on your recovery over the next few days. you might need to keep stool out of the wound, and if that's not possible, we might have to do a diverting colostomy. but don't worry, we'll talk more about that with you and your family. for now, just make sure to keep the area clean and dry.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Right pelvic pain.
2.  Right ovarian mass.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Right pelvic pain.
2.  Right ovarian mass.
3.  8 cm x 10 cm right ovarian cyst with ovarian torsion.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
Laparoscopic right salpingooophorectomy.
ANESTHESIA:
General with endotracheal tube.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
Less than 50 cc.
TUBES:
None.
DRAINS:
None.
PATHOLOGY:
The right tube and ovary sent to pathology for review.
FINDINGS:
On exam under anesthesia, a normal-appearing vulva and vagina and normally palpated cervix, a uterus that was normal size, and a large right adnexal mass.  Laparoscopic findings demonstrated a 8 cm x 10 cm smooth right ovarian cyst that was noted to be torsed twice.  Otherwise, the uterus, left tube and ovary, bowel, liver margins, appendix, and gallbladder were noted all to be within normal limits.  There was no noted blood in the pelvis.
INDICATIONS FOR THIS PROCEDURE:
The patient is a 26-year-old G1 P1 who presented to ABCD General Emergency Room with complaint of right lower quadrant pain since last night, which has been increasing in intensity.  The pain persisted despite multiple pain medications given in the Emergency Room.  The patient reports positive nausea and vomiting.  There was no vaginal bleeding or discharge.  There was no fevers or chills.  Her cultures done in the Emergency Room were pending.  The patient did have an ultrasound that demonstrated an 8 cm right ovarian cyst, questionable hemorrhagic.  The uterus and left ovary were within normal limits.  There was a positive flow noted to bilateral ovaries on ultrasound.  Therefore, it was felt appropriate to take the patient for a diagnostic laparoscopy with a possible oophorectomy.
PROCEDURE:
After informed consent was obtained, and all questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction in layman's terms, she was taken to the operating room where general anesthesia was obtained without any difficulty.  She was placed in dorsal lithotomy position with the use of Allis strips and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Her bladder was drained with a red Robinson catheter and she was examined under anesthesia and was noted to have the findings as above.  She was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A weighted speculum was placed in the patient's vagina with excellent visualization of the cervix.  The cervix was grasped at 12 o'clock position with a single-toothed tenaculum and pulled into the operative field.  The uterus was then sounded to approximately 3.5 inches and then a uterine elevator was placed.  The vulsellum tenaculum was removed.  The weighted speculum was removed.  Attention was then turned to the abdomen where 1 cm infraumbilical incision was made in the infraumbilical fold.  The Veress step needle was then placed into the abdomen while the abdomen was being tented up with towel clamp.  The CO2 was then turned on with unoccluded flow and excellent pressures.  This was continued till a normal symmetrical pneumoperitoneum was obtained.  Then, a #11 mm step trocar and sleeve were placed into the infraumbilical port without any difficulty and placement was confirmed by laparoscope.  Laparoscopic findings are as noted above.  A suprapubic incision was made with the knife and then a #12 mm step trocar and sleeve were placed in the suprapubic region under direct visualization.  Then, a grasper was used to untorse the ovary.  Then, a #12 mm port was placed in the right flank region under direct visualization using a LigaSure vessel sealing system.  The right tube and ovary were amputated and noted to be hemostatic.  The EndoCatch bag was then placed through the suprapubic port and the ovary was placed into the bag.  The ovary was too large to fit completely into the bag.  Therefore, a laparoscopic needle with a 60 cc syringe was used to aspirate the contents of the ovary while it was still inside the bag.
There was approximately 200 cc of fluid aspirated from the cyst.  This was a clear yellow fluid.  Then, the bag was closed and the ovary was removed from the suprapubic port.  The suprapubic port did have to be extended somewhat to allow for the removal of the ovary.  The trocar and sleeve were then placed back into the port.  The abdomen was copiously irrigated with warm normal saline using the Nezhat-Dorsey suction irrigator and the incision site was noted to be hemostatic.  The pelvis was clear and clean.
Pictures were obtained.  The suprapubic port was then removed under direct visualization and then using a #0-vicyrl and UR6.  Two figure-of-eight sutures were placed in the fascia of suprapubic port and fascia was closed and the pneumoperitoneum was maintained after the sutures were placed.  Therefore, the peritoneal surface was noted to be hemostatic.  Therefore, the camera was removed.  All instruments were removed.  The abdomen was allowed to completely deflate and then the trocars were placed back through the sleeves of the right flank #12 port and the infraumbilical port and these were removed.  The infraumbilical port was examined and noted to have a small fascial defect which was repaired with #0-Vicryl and UR6.  The right flank area was palpated and there was no facial defect noted.  The skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in subcuticular fashion.  Dressings were changed.  The weighted speculum was removed from the patient's cervix.  The cervix noted to be hemostatic.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2 and the patient was taken to the Recovery in stable condition.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the surgery?
[patient] hi, i'm feeling good, just a little sore.
[doctor] that's normal after a surgery like this. let me go over your postoperative diagnoses. you had right pelvic pain and an ovarian mass. during the surgery, we found an 8 cm x 10 cm right ovarian cyst with ovarian torsion, which we removed through laparoscopic right salpingooophorectomy. how are you feeling now?
[patient] i'm a little relieved that the cyst is out, but still sore.
[doctor] that's understandable. the surgery went well with no complications. your estimated blood loss was less than 50 cc, and you did not need any tubes or drains. we sent your right tube and ovary to pathology for review, and i'll let you know if there are any findings.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Ruptured globe OX.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Ruptured globe OX.
PROCEDURE:
Repair of ruptured globe OX.
ANESTHESIA:
General,SPECIMENS:
None.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
INDICATIONS:
This is a XX-year-old (wo)man with a ruptured globe of the XXX eye.
PROCEDURE:
The risks and benefits of eye surgery were discussed at length with the patient, including bleeding, infection, re-operation, loss of vision, and loss of the eye. Informed consent was obtained. The patient received IV antibiotics including Ancef and Levaeuin prior to surgery. The patient was brought to the operating room and placud in the supine position, where (s)he wad prepped and draped in the routine fashion. A wire lid speculum was placed to provide exposure.
Upon examination and dissection of the conjunctiva superiorly, a scleral rupture was found. The rupture extended approximately 15 mm in length superior to the cornea, approximately 2 mm from the limbus in a horizontal fashion. There was also a rupture at the limbus, near the middle of this laceration, causing the anterior chamber to be flat. There was a large blood clot filling the anterior chamber. An attempt was made to wash out the anterior chamber with BSS on a cannula. The BSS was injected through the limbal rupture, which communicated with the anterior chamber. The blood clot did not move. It was extremely adherent to the iris.
At that time, the rupture that involved the limbus from approximately 10:30 until 12 o'clock was closed using 1 suture of 10-0 nylon. The scleral laceration was then closed using 10 interrupted sutures with 9-0 Vicryl. At that time, the anterior chamber was formed and appeared to be fairly deep. The wounds were checked and found to be watertight. The knots were rotated posteriorly and the conjunctiva was draped up over the sutures and sewn into position at the limbus using four 7-0 Vicryl sutures, 2 nasally and 2 temporally. All suture knots were buried.
Gentamicin 0.5 cc was injected subconjunctivally. Then, the speculum was removed. The drapes were removed. Several drops of Ocuflox and Maxitrol ointment were placed in the XXX eye. An eye patch and shield were placed over the eye. The patient was awakened from general anesthesia without difficulty and taken to the recovery room in good condition.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?
[patient] i'm a bit sore, but i'm doing okay.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Rotator cuff tear, left.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Sixty-percent rotator cuff tear, joint side.
2.  Impingement syndrome.
ANESTHESIA:
General,NAME OF OPERATION:
1.  Arthroscopic subacromial decompression.
2.  Repair of rotator cuff through mini-arthrotomy.
FINDINGS AT OPERATION:
The patient's glenohumeral joint was completely clear, other than obvious tear of the rotator cuff.  The midportion of this appeared to be complete, but for the most part, this was about a 60% rupture of the tendon.  This was confirmed later when the bursal side was opened up.  Note, the patient also had abrasion of the coracoacromial ligament under the anterolateral edge of the acromion.  He did not have any acromioclavicular joint pain or acromioclavicular joint disease noted.
PROCEDURE:
He was given an anesthetic, examined, prepped, and draped in a sterile fashion in a beach-chair position.  The shoulder was instilled with fluid from posteriorly, followed by the arthroscope.  The shoulder was instilled with fluid from posteriorly, followed by the arthroscope.  Arthroscopy was then carried out in standard fashion using a 30-degree Dionic scope.  With the scope in the posterior portal, the above findings were noted, and an anterior portal was established.  A curved shaver was placed for debridement of the tear.  I established this was about a 60-70% tear with a probable complete area of tear which was very small.  There were no problems at the biceps or the rest of the joint.  The subacromial space showed findings, as noted above, and a thorough subacromial decompression was carried out with a Bovie, rotary shaver, and bur.  I did not debride the acromioclavicular joint.  The lateral portal was then extended to a mini-arthrotomy, and subacromial space was entered by blunt dissection through the deltoid.  The area of weakness of the tendon was found, and was transversely cut, and findings were confirmed.  The diseased tissue was removed, and the greater tuberosity was abraded with a rongeur.  Tendon-to-tendon repair was then carried out with buried sutures of 2-0 Ethibond, giving a very nice repair.  The shoulder was carried through a range of motion.  I could see no evidence of impingement.  Copious irrigation was carried out.  The deltoid deep fascia was anatomically closed, as was the superficial fascia.  The subcutaneous tissue and skin were closed in layers.  A sterile dressing was applied.  The patient appeared to tolerate the procedure well.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after the surgery?
[patient] hello. i'm feeling a bit groggy still, but overall, i think i'm doing alright.
[doctor] good to hear. i just wanted to go over the findings from the surgery with you. during the operation, we found a 60% tear in your rotator cuff on the joint side, and also an impingement syndrome. we did an arthroscopic subacromial decompression and then repaired the rotator cuff through a mini-arthrotomy. 
[patient] okay, thank you for letting me know.
[doctor] of course. we used a 30-degree scope and established the tear was about 60-70% with a small complete area of tear. we debrided the tear and carried out a thorough subacromial decompression. we didn't debride the acromioclavicular joint, and then we repaired the tendon-to-tendon with buried sutures of 2-0 ethibond. 
[patient] alright, thank you for explaining that to me. 
[doctor] sure thing. we checked the shoulder's range of motion and didn't see any evidence of impingement. we irrigated the area, and then closed the deltoid deep fascia, superficial fascia, and subcutaneous tissue and skin in layers.

[doctor] that's good to hear. we performed surgery to repair a ruptured globe with full-thickness corneal laceration in your left eye. i discussed the risks and benefits of the procedure with you, including bleeding, infection, astigmatism, cataract, re-operation, loss of vision, and loss of the eye. you provided informed consent, and we gave you iv antibiotics, including ancef and levofloxacin, before the surgery. we performed the surgery with you under general anesthesia. the surgery went well, and there were no complications.
[patient] okay, thank you for the update.
[doctor] during the surgery, we placed a wire lid speculum to provide exposure and then used 0.12 forceps and a superblade to create a paracentesis at around 11 o'clock. then, we injected viscoat through the paracentesis to fill the anterior chamber, and the viscoat cannula was used to remove the incarcerated iris tissue from the wound. we injected more viscoat to deepen the anterior chamber and used a 10-0 nylon suture to place four sutures to close the corneal laceration. we then injected bss to fill the anterior chamber and noticed a small leak at the inferior end of the wound, so we placed a fifth 10-0 nylon suture. the wound was packed, and we made sure it was watertight. we placed several drops in your left eye, including ocuflox, pred forte, timolol 0.5%, alphagan, and trusopt. we then covered your eye with an eye patch and shield.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Nasal deformity, status post rhinoplasty.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Same.
PROCEDURE:
Revision rhinoplasty (CPT 30450).  Left conchal cartilage harvest (CPT 21235).
ANESTHESIA:
General.
INDICATIONS FOR THE PROCEDURE:
This patient is an otherwise healthy male who had a previous nasal fracture.  During his healing, perioperatively he did sustain a hockey puck to the nose resulting in a saddle-nose deformity with septal hematoma.  The patient healed status post rhinoplasty as a result but was left with a persistent saddle-nose dorsal defect.  The patient was consented for the above-stated procedure.  The risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The patient did have approximately 12 mL of Lidocaine with epinephrine 1% with 1:100,000 infiltrated into the nasal soft tissues.  In addition to this, cocaine pledgets were placed to assist with hemostasis.
At this point, attention was turned to the left ear.  Approximately 3 mL of 1% Lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was infiltrated into the subcutaneous tissues of the conchal bulb.  Betadine was utilized for preparation.  A 15 blade was used to incise along the posterior conchal area and a Freer elevator was utilized to lift the soft tissues off the conchal cartilage in a submucoperichondrial plane.  I then completed this along the posterior aspect of the conchal cartilage, was transected in the concha cavum and concha cymba, both were harvested.  These were placed aside in saline.  Hemostasis was obtained with bipolar electrocauterization.  Bovie electrocauterization was also employed as needed.  The entire length of the wound was then closed with 5-0 plain running locking suture.  The patient then had a Telfa placed both anterior and posterior to the conchal defect and placed in a sandwich dressing utilizing a 2-0 Prolene suture.  Antibiotic ointment was applied generously.
Next, attention was turned to opening and lifting the soft tissues of the nose.  A typical external columella inverted V gull-wing incision was placed on the columella and trailed into a marginal incision.  The soft tissues of the nose were then elevated using curved sharp scissors and Metzenbaums.  Soft tissues were elevated over the lower lateral cartilages, upper lateral cartilages onto the nasal dorsum.  At this point, attention was turned to osteotomies and examination of the external cartilages.
The patient did have very broad lower lateral cartilages leading to a bulbous tip.  The lower lateral cartilages were trimmed in a symmetrical fashion leaving at least 8 mm of lower lateral cartilage bilaterally along the lateral aspect.  Having completed this, the patient had medial and lateral osteotomies performed with a 2-mm osteotome.  These were done transmucosally after elevating the tract using a Cottle elevator.  Direct hemostasis pressure was applied to assist with bruising.
Next, attention was turned to tip mechanisms.  The patient had a series of double-dome sutures placed into the nasal tip.  Then, 5-0 Dexon was employed for intradomal suturing, 5-0 clear Prolene was used for interdomal suturing.  Having completed this, a 5-0 clear Prolene alar spanning suture was employed to narrow the superior tip area.
Next, attention was turned to dorsal augmentation.  A Gore-Tex small implant had been selected, previously incised.  This was taken to the back table and carved under sterile conditions.  The patient then had the implant placed into the super-tip area to assist with support of the nasal dorsum.  It was placed into a precise pocket and remained in the midline.
Next, attention was turned to performing a columella strut.  The cartilage from the concha was shaped into a strut and placed into a precision pocket between the medial footplate of the lower lateral cartilage.  This was fixed into position utilizing a 5-0 Dexon suture.
Having completed placement of all augmentation grafts, the patient was examined for hemostasis.  The external columella inverted gull-wing incision along the nasal tip was closed with a series of interrupted everting 6-0 black nylon sutures.  The entire marginal incisions for cosmetic rhinoplasty were closed utilizing a series of 5-0 plain interrupted sutures.
At the termination of the case, the ear was inspected and the position of the conchal cartilage harvest was hemostatic.  There was no evidence of hematoma, and the patient had a series of brown Steri-Strips and Aquaplast cast placed over the nasal dorsum.  The inner nasal area was then examined at the termination of the case and it seemed to be hemostatic as well.
The patient was transferred to the PACU in stable condition.  He was charged to home on antibiotics to prevent infection both from the left ear conchal cartilage harvest and also the Gore-Tex implant area.  He was asked to follow up in 4 days for removal of the bolster overlying the conchal cartilage harvest.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after your revision rhinoplasty?
[patient] i have some discomfort and swelling, but overall i'm doing okay.
[doctor] that's good to hear. i just wanted to check in with you and go over the details of your procedure. you came in for a revision rhinoplasty due to a saddle-nose deformity resulting from a previous nasal fracture and a subsequent hockey puck injury. during the procedure, we performed a left conchal cartilage harvest and utilized gore-tex implant for dorsal augmentation. we also performed osteotomies, double-dome sutures, and interdomal suturing for tip mechanisms. do you have any questions about the details of the procedure?
[patient] no, not really. i just want to make sure i understand what was done and what to expect during recovery.
[doctor] of course. you may experience some discomfort, swelling, and bruising, especially around the nasal tip. we placed a series of brown steri-strips and aquaplast cast over the nasal dorsum to help with healing. you will also need to take antibiotics to prevent infection from the left ear conchal cartilage harvest and gore-tex implant area. i want you to follow up in 4 days for removal of the bolster overlying the conchal cartilage harvest. how are you feeling about the procedure overall?

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Squamous cell carcinoma, left nasal cavity.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Squamous cell carcinoma, left nasal cavity.
OPERATIONS PERFORMED:
1.  Nasal endoscopy.
2.  Partial rhinectomy.
ANESTHESIA:
General endotracheal.
INDICATIONS:
This is an 81-year-old gentleman who underwent septorhinoplasty many years ago.  He also has a history of a skin lesion, which was removed from the nasal ala many years ago, the details of which he does not recall.  He has been complaining of tenderness and induration of his nasal tip for approximately two years and has been treated unsuccessfully for folliculitis and cellulitis of the nasal tip.  He was evaluated by Dr. A, who performed the septorhinoplasty, and underwent an intranasal biopsy, which showed histologic evidence of invasive squamous cell carcinoma.  The preoperative examination shows induration of the nasal tip without significant erythema.  There is focal tenderness just cephalad to the alar crease.  There is no lesion either externally or intranasally.
PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:
The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position.  Following induction of adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, the left nose was decongested with Afrin.  He was prepped and draped in standard fashion.  The left nasal cavity was examined by anterior rhinoscopy.  The septum was midline.  There was slight asymmetry of the nares.  No lesion was seen within the nasal cavity either in the area of the intercartilaginous area, which was biopsied by Dr. A, the septum, the lateral nasal wall, and the floor.  The 0-degree nasal endoscope was then used to examine the nasal cavity more completely.  No lesion was detectable.  A left intercartilaginous incision was made with a #15 blade since this was the area of previous biopsy by Dr. A.  The submucosal tissue was thickened diffusely, but there was no identifiable distinct or circumscribed lesion present.  Random biopsies of the submucosal tissue were taken and submitted to pathology for frozen section.  A diagnosis of diffuse invasive squamous cell carcinoma was rendered.  An alar incision was made with a #15 blade and the full-thickness incision was completed with the electrocautery.  The incision was carried more cephalad through the lower lateral cartilage up to the area of the upper lateral cartilage at the superior margin.  The full unit of the left nasal tip was excised completely and submitted to pathology after tagging and labeling it.  Frozen section examination again revealed diffuse squamous cell carcinoma throughout the soft tissues involving all margins.  Additional soft tissue was then taken from all margins tagging them for the pathologist.  The inferior margins were noted to be clear on the next frozen section report, but there was still disease present in the region of the upper lateral cartilage at its insertion with the nasal bone.  A Joseph elevator was used to elevate the periosteum off the maxillary process and off the inferior aspect of the nasal bone.  Additional soft tissue was taken in these regions along the superior margin.  The frozen section examination revealed persistent disease medially and additional soft tissue was taken and submitted to pathology.  Once all margins had been cleared histologically, additional soft tissue was taken from the entire wound.  A 5-mm chisel was used to take down the inferior aspect of the nasal bone and the medial-most aspect of the maxilla.  This was all submitted to pathology for routine permanent examination.  Xeroform gauze was then fashioned to cover the defect and was sutured along the periphery of the wound with interrupted 6-0 nylon suture to provide a barrier and moisture.  The anesthetic was then discontinued as the patient was extubated and transferred to the PACU in good condition having tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge and needle counts were correct.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling?
[patient] i'm feeling okay, a bit sore.
[doctor] that's understandable. you underwent a nasal endoscopy and a partial rhinectomy. the preoperative examination showed a tenderness and induration of your nasal tip, which was treated unsuccessfully for folliculitis and cellulitis. the biopsy showed that you had squamous cell carcinoma in your left nasal cavity, which required surgery. 
[patient] i see.
[doctor] during the procedure, we made a left intercartilaginous incision, and upon examination, the submucosal tissue was thickened diffusely. random biopsies were taken and were submitted to pathology for frozen section. we found that you had diffuse invasive squamous cell carcinoma. we then made an alar incision, and excised the full unit of the left nasal tip. frozen section examination revealed diffuse squamous cell carcinoma throughout the soft tissues, involving all margins. additional soft tissue was taken from all margins, and once all margins had been cleared histologically, additional soft tissue was taken from the entire wound. we used xeroform gauze to cover the defect and you were transferred to the pacu in good condition.

Removal of venous port.
ANESTHESIA:
General.
INDICATIONS:
This 9-year-old young lady presented with ALL in Orange County and had a port placed at that time.  She subsequently has now undergone chemotherapy here and is now off therapy.  She no longer needs her venous port so, comes to the operating room today for its removal.
OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:
After the induction of general anesthetic, the exit site was prepped and draped in usual manner.  The previous incision was opened by excising the old scar.  The port pocket was then opened and the port was removed from the pocket.  There was a resistance to the catheter being removed and so therefore, we began following the catheter along its path opening the tract until finally the catheter seemed to come free and could be pulled out without difficulty.  The port pocket was then closed using a #3-0 Vicryl in subcutaneous tissue, #5-0 subcuticular Monocryl in the skin.  Sterile dressing was applied.  Young lady was awakened and taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after the surgery?

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Complex Regional Pain Syndrome Type I.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Same.
PROCEDURE:
1.  Stellate ganglion RFTC (radiofrequency thermocoagulation)  left side.
2.  Interpretation of Radiograph.
ANESTHESIA:
IV Sedation with Versed and Fentanyl.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
None.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
INDICATIONS:
Patient with reflex sympathetic dystrophy, left side.  Positive for allodynia, pain, mottled appearance, skin changes upper extremities as well as swelling.
SUMMARY OF PROCEDURE:
Patient is admitted to the Operating Room.  Monitors placed, including EKG, Pulse oximeter, and BP cuff.  Patient had a pillow placed under the shoulder blades.  The head and neck was allowed to fall back into hyperextension.  The neck region was prepped and draped in sterile fashion with Betadine and alcohol.  Four sterile towels were placed.  The cricothyroid membrane was palpated, then going one finger's breadth lateral from the cricothyroid membrane and one finger's breadth inferior, the carotid pulse was palpated and the sheath was retracted laterally.  A 22 gauge SMK 5-mm bare tipped needle was then introduced in between the cricothyroid membrane and the carotid sheath and directed inferiomedially.  The needle is advanced prudently through the tissues, avoiding the carotid artery laterally.  The tip of the needle is perceived to intersect with the vertebral body of Cervical #7 and this was visualized by fluoroscopy.  Aspiration was cautiously performed after the needle was retracted approximately 1 mm and held steady with left hand.  No venous or arterial blood return is noted.  No cerebral spinal fluid is noted.  Positive sensory stimulation was elicited using the Radionics unit at 50 Hz from 0-0.1 volts and negative motor stimulation was elicited from 1-10 volts at 2 Hz.  After negative aspiration through the 22 gauge SMK 5mm bare tipped needle is absolutely confirmed, 5 cc of solution (solution consisting of 5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine, 1 cc of triamcinolone) was then injected into the stellate ganglion region.  This was done with intermittent aspiration vigilantly verifying negative aspiration.  The stylet was then promptly replaced and neurolysis (nerve decompression) was then carried out for 60 seconds at 80 degrees centigrade.  This exact same procedure using the exact same protocol was repeated one more time to complete the two lesions of the stellate ganglion.  The patient was immediately placed in the sitting position to reduce any side effect from the stellate ganglion block associated with cephalad spread of the solution.  Pressure was placed over the puncture site for approximately five minutes to eliminate any hemorrhage from blood vessels that may have been punctured and a Band-Aid was placed over the puncture site.  Patient was monitored for an additional ten to fifteen minutes and was noted to have tolerated the procedure well without any adverse sequelae.  Significant temperature elevation was noted on the affected side verifying neurolysis of the ganglion.
Interpretation of radiograph reveals placement of the 22-gauge SMK 5-mm bare tipped needle in the region of the stellate ganglion on the affected side.  Four lesions were carried out.","[doctor]: good afternoon. how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient]: hello, i'm feeling better. the pain is not as intense as before.
[doctor]: great to hear that. can you tell me about your symptoms before the procedure?
[patient]: sure. i was diagnosed with complex regional pain syndrome type i, and i had pain, allodynia, mottled appearance, skin changes, and swelling on my left upper extremity.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Nasal obstruction secondary to deviated nasal septum.
2.  Bilateral turbinate hypertrophy.
PROCEDURE:
Cosmetic rhinoplasty.  Request for cosmetic change in the external appearance of the nose.
ANESTHESIA:
General via endotracheal tube.
INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION:
The patient is a 26-year-old white female with longstanding nasal obstruction.  She also has concerns with regard to the external appearance of her nose and is requesting changes in the external appearance of her nose.  From her functional standpoint, she has severe left-sided nasal septal deviation with compensatory inferior turbinate hypertrophy.  From the aesthetic standpoint, the nose is over projected, lacks rotation, and has a large dorsal hump.  First we are going to straighten the nasal septum and reduce the size of the turbinates and then we will also take down the hump, rotate the tip of the nose, and de-project the nasal tip.  I explained to her the risks, benefits, alternatives, and complications for postsurgical procedure.  She had her questions asked and answered and requested that we proceed with surgery as outlined above.
PROCEDURE DETAILS:
The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position.  The appropriate level of general endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  The face, head, and neck were sterilely prepped and draped.  The nose was anesthetized and vasoconstricted in the usual fashion.  Procedure began with a left hemitransfixion incision, which was brought down into the left intercartilaginous incision.  Right intercartilaginous incision was also made and the dorsum of the nose was elevated in the submucoperichondrial and subperiosteal plane.  Intact bilateral septomucoperichondrial flaps were elevated and a severe left-sided nasal septal deviation was corrected by detachment of the caudal nasal septum from the maxillary crest in a swinging door fashion and placing it back into the midline.  Posterior vomerine spur was divided superiorly and inferiorly and a large spur was removed.  Anterior and inferior one-third of each inferior turbinate was clamped, cut, and resected.  The upper lateral cartilages were divided from their attachments to the dorsal nasal septum and the cartilaginous septum was lowered by approximately 2 mm.  The bony hump of the nose was lowered with a straight osteotome by 4 mm.  Fading medial osteotomies were carried out and lateral osteotomies were then created in order to narrow the bony width of the nose.  The tip of the nose was then addressed via a retrograde dissection and removal of cephalic caudal semicircle cartilage medially at the tip.  The caudal septum was shortened by 2 mm in an angle in order to enhance rotation.  Medial crural footplates were reattached to the caudal nasal septum with a projection rotation control suture of #3-0 chromic.  The upper lateral cartilages were rejoined to the dorsal septum with a #4-0 plain gut suture.  No middle valves or bone grafts were necessary.  Intact mucoperichondrial flaps were closed with 4-0 plain gut suture and Doyle nasal splints were placed on either side of the nasal septum.  The middle meatus was filled with Surgicel and Cortisporin otic and external Denver splint was applied with sterile tape and Mastisol.  Excellent aesthetic and functional results were thus obtained and the patient was awakened in the operating room, taken to the recovery room in good condition.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling?
[patient] i am feeling good, thank you.
[doctor] that's great to hear. so, i went through your medical history and i see that you have been having some long-standing nasal obstruction along with concerns about the external appearance of your nose, is that correct?
[patient] yes, that's right.
[doctor] alright. based on the details that you provided to me, i believe that you would benefit from cosmetic rhinoplasty. we will start by straightening your nasal septum and reducing the size of your turbinates. after that, we will work on reducing the hump on your nose, rotating the tip, and de-projecting it. i have explained the risks, benefits, alternatives, and complications of the post-surgical procedure to you. do you have any questions or concerns?
[patient] no, i don't have any questions. i'm ready for the surgery.
[doctor] okay. we will give you general anesthesia via endotracheal tube before the procedure. during the procedure, we will make a left hemitransfixion incision and bring it down into the left intercartilaginous incision. we will also make a right intercartilaginous incision and then correct the severe left-sided nasal septal deviation. we will remove the posterior vomerine spur and cut and resect the anterior and inferior one-third of each inferior turbinate. we will then lower the cartilaginous septum and reduce the bony hump of the nose. after that, we will narrow the bony width of the nose by carrying out fading medial osteotomies and creating lateral osteotomies. finally, we will address the tip of the nose and enhance its rotation. after the surgery, we will place doyle nasal splints on either side of the nasal septum and fill the middle meatus with surgicel and cortisporin otic. we will also apply an external denver splint with sterile tape and mastisol. do you have any questions about the procedure details?
[patient] no, i don't have any questions.
[doctor] okay, then we will proceed with the surgery as planned.","[doctor] hey there, how're you feeling today?
[patient] i'm feeling good, thanks.
[doctor] awesome. so, i had a look at your medical history and it seems you've been having trouble with your nose. you're concerned about the way it looks and have been dealing with nasal obstruction for a while now, right?
[patient] yup, that's the one.
[doctor] alrighty. based on what you've told me, i think you'd benefit from some cosmetic rhinoplasty. we'll start by fixing your nasal septum and reducing the size of your turbinates. after that, we'll work on smoothing out the hump on your nose, rotating the tip and de-projecting it. i've already talked you through the risks, benefits, alternatives, and complications of the procedure. do you have any questions or concerns?
[patient] nope, i'm good to go.
[doctor] great. for the surgery, we'll give you general anesthesia via endotracheal tube. during the procedure, we'll make a left hemitransfixion incision and bring it down into the left intercartilaginous incision. we'll also make a right intercartilaginous incision and then correct the severe left-sided nasal septal deviation. we'll remove the posterior vomerine spur and cut and resect the anterior and inferior one-third of each inferior turbinate. we'll then lower the cartilaginous septum and reduce the bony hump of the nose. after that, we'll narrow the bony width of the nose by carrying out fading medial osteotomies and creating lateral osteotomies. finally, we'll work on the tip of the nose and enhance its rotation. after the surgery, we'll place doyle nasal splints on either side of the nasal septum and fill the middle meatus with surgicel and cortisporin otic. we'll also apply an external denver splint with sterile tape and mastisol. any questions so far?

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Stenosing tendinosis, right thumb (trigger finger).
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Stenosing tendinosis, right thumb (trigger finger).
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
Release of A1 pulley, right thumb.
ANESTHESIA:
IV regional with sedation.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
Minimal.
TOURNIQUET TIME:
Approximately 20 minutes at 250 mmHg.
INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS:
There was noted to be thickening of the A1 pulley.  There was a fibrous nodule noted within the flexor tendon of the thumb, which caused triggering sensation to the thumb.
HISTORY:
This is a 51-year-old right hand dominant female with a longstanding history of pain as well as locking sensation to her right thumb.  She was actually able to spontaneously trigger the thumb.  She was diagnosed with stenosing tendinosis and wishes to proceed with release of A1 pulley.  All risks and benefits of the surgery was discussed with her at length.  She was in agreement with the above treatment plan.
PROCEDURE:
On 08/21/03, she was taken to operating room at ABCD General Hospital and placed supine on the operating table.  A regional anesthetic was applied by the Anesthesia Department.  Tourniquet was placed on her proximal arm.  The upper extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.
An incision was made over the proximal crease of the thumb.  Subcuticular tissues were carefully dissected.  Hemostasis was controlled with electrocautery.  The nerves were identified and retracted throughout the entire procedure.  The fibers of the A1 pulley were identified.  They were sharply dissected to release the tendon.  The tendon was then pulled up into the wound and inspected.  There was no evidence of gross tear noted.  Fibrous nodule was noted within the tendon itself.  There was no evidence of continuous locking.  Once release of the pulley had been performed, the wound was copiously irrigated.  It was then reapproximated using #5-0 nylon simple interrupted and horizontal mattress sutures.  Sterile dressing was applied to the upper extremity.  Tourniquet was deflated.  It was noted that the thumb was warm and pink with good capillary refill.  The patient was transferred to Recovery in apparent stable and satisfactory condition.  Prognosis is fair.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] hi, doctor. i'm feeling okay, a little sore, but i expected that.
[doctor] that's good to hear. i just wanted to go over some details with you about the procedure. we released the a1 pulley in your right thumb to treat the stenosing tendinosis, also known as trigger finger. during the procedure, there was some thickening of the a1 pulley and a fibrous nodule within the flexor tendon of your thumb, which was causing the triggering sensation. we were able to release the pulley and inspect the tendon, which did not show any signs of gross tear.
[patient] okay, that all sounds good.
[doctor] we used iv regional anesthesia with sedation and there were no complications during the procedure. the estimated blood loss was minimal and the tourniquet was applied for approximately 20 minutes at 250 mmhg. after the procedure, your thumb was warm and pink with good capillary refill, and you were transferred to recovery in stable condition.
[patient] thank you for letting me know.
[doctor] of course. it's important for you to know what we did during the procedure and what to expect during your recovery. you may experience some soreness and swelling, but that should subside within a few days. i recommend keeping your hand elevated and applying ice to help with any discomfort. we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to make sure everything is healing properly.

DETAILS OF PROCEDURE:
INT was placed.  The patient was in the operating room in the prone position with the back prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  The patient was given sedation and monitored.  Lidocaine 1.5% for skin wheal was made 10 cm from the midline to the bilateral L2 distal vertebral body.  A 20-gauge, 15 cm SMK needle was then directed using AP and fluoroscopic guidance so that the tip of the needle was noted to be along the distal one-third and anterior border on the lateral view and on the AP view the tip of the needle was inside the lateral third of the border of the vertebral body.  At this time a negative motor stimulation was obtained.  Injection of 10 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plus 10 mg of Depo-Medrol was performed. Coagulation was then carried out for 90oC for 90 seconds.  At the conclusion of this, the needle under fluoroscopic guidance was withdrawn approximately 5 mm where again a negative motor stimulation was obtained and the sequence of injection and coagulation was repeated.  This was repeated one more time with a 5 mm withdrawal and coagulation.
At that time, attention was directed to the L3 body where the needle was placed to the upper one-third/distal two-thirds junction and the sequence of injection, coagulation, and negative motor stimulation with needle withdrawal one time of a 5 mm distance was repeated.  There were no compilations from this.  The patient was discharged to operating room recovery in stable condition.","[doctor] hi there! how are you feeling after your procedure?

"PROCEDURE:
Bilateral L5, S1, S2, and S3 radiofrequency ablation.
INDICATION:
Sacroiliac joint pain.
INFORMED CONSENT:
The risks, benefits and alternatives of the procedure were discussed with the patient.  The patient was given opportunity to ask questions regarding the procedure, its indications and the associated risks.
The risk of the procedure discussed include infection, bleeding, allergic reaction, dural puncture, headache, nerve injuries, spinal cord injury, and cardiovascular and CNS side effects with possible of vascular entry of medications.  I also informed the patient of potential side effects or reactions to the medications potentially used during the procedure including sedatives, narcotics, nonionic contrast agents, anesthetics, and corticosteroids.
The patient was informed both verbally and in writing.  The patient understood the informed consent and desired to have the procedure performed.
PROCEDURE:
Oxygen saturation and vital signs were monitored continuously throughout the procedure.  The patient remained awake throughout the procedure in order to interact and give feedback.  The x-ray technician was supervised and instructed to operate the fluoroscopy machine.
The patient was placed in a prone position on the treatment table with a pillow under the chest and head rotated.  The skin over and surrounding the treatment area was cleaned with Betadine.  The area was covered with sterile drapes, leaving a small window opening for needle placement.  Fluoroscopy was used to identify the bony landmarks of the sacrum and the sacroiliac joints and the planned needle approach.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle within the planned approach were anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine.
With fluoroscopy, a 20 gauge 10-mm bent Teflon coated needle was gently guided into the groove between the SAP and the sacrum for the dorsal ramus of L5 and the lateral border of the posterior sacral foramen, for the lateral branches of S1, S2, and S3.  Also, fluoroscopic views were used to ensure proper needle placement.
The following technique was used to confirm correct placement.  Motor stimulation was applied at 2 Hz with 1 millisecond duration.  No extremity movement was noted at less than 2 volts.  Following this, the needle trocar was removed and a syringe containing 1% lidocaine was attached.  At each level, after syringe aspiration with no blood return, 0.5 mL of 1% lidocaine was injected to anesthetize the lateral branch and the surrounding tissue.  After completion, a lesion was created at that level with a temperature of 80 degrees for 90 seconds.
All injected medications were preservative free.  Sterile technique was used throughout the procedure.
ADDITIONAL DETAILS:
None.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
DISCUSSION:
Post-procedure vital signs and oximetry were stable.  The patient was discharged with instructions to ice the injection site as needed for 15-20 minutes as frequently as twice per hour for the next day and to avoid aggressive activities for 1 day.  The patient was told to resume all medications.  The patient was told to be in relative rest for 1 day but then could resume all normal activities.
The patient was instructed to seek immediate medical attention for shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, chills, increased pain, weakness, sensory or motor changes, or changes in bowel or bladder function.
Follow up appointment was made at PM&R Spine Clinic in approximately one to two weeks.","[doctor]: hi there! how are you feeling after the radiofrequency ablation on your sacroiliac joint?

The patient was taken to the operating room.  She underwent general endotracheal anesthetic.  The TED stockings and venous compression devices were placed on both lower extremities and they were functioning well.  The patient's left anterior chest wall, neck, axilla, and left arm were prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  The recent biopsy site was located in the upper and outer quadrant of left breast.  The plain incision was marked along the skin.  Tissues and the flaps were injected with 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine solution and then a transverse elliptical incision was made in the breast of the skin to include nipple areolar complex as well as the recent biopsy site.  The flaps were raised superiorly and just below the clavicle medially to the sternum, laterally towards the latissimus dorsi, rectus abdominus fascia.  Following this, the breast tissue along with the pectoralis major fascia were dissected off the pectoralis major muscle.  The dissection was started medially and extended laterally towards the left axilla.  The breast was removed and then the axillary contents were dissected out.  Left axillary vein and artery were identified and preserved as well as the lung _____.  The patient had several clinically palpable lymph nodes, they were removed with the axillary dissection.  Care was taken to avoid injury to any of the above mentioned neurovascular structures.  After the tissues were irrigated, we made sure there were no signs of bleeding.  Hemostasis had been achieved with Hemoclips.  Hemovac drains x2 were then brought in and placed under the left axilla as well as in the superior and inferior breast flaps.  The subcu was then approximated with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl sutures and skin with clips.  The drains were sutured to the chest wall with 3-0 nylon sutures.  Dressing was applied and the procedure was completed.  The patient went to the recovery room in stable condition.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling today?

"PROCEDURES PERFORMED,1.  Insertion of subclavian dual-port Port-A-Cath.
2.  Surgeon-interpreted fluoroscopy.
OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  Next, the chest was prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion.  A #18-gauge spinal needle was used to aspirate blood from the subclavian vein.  After aspiration of venous blood, Seldinger technique was used to thread a J wire.  The distal tip of the J wire was confirmed to be in adequate position with surgeon-interpreted fluoroscopy.  Next a #15-blade scalpel was used to make an incision in the skin.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the pectoralis muscle.  A pocket was created.  A dual-port Port-A-Cath was lowered into the pocket and secured with #2-0 Prolene.  Both ports were flushed.  The distal tip was pulled through to the wire exit site with a Kelly clamp.  It was cut to the appropriate length.  Next a dilator and sheath were threaded over the J wire.  The J wire and dilator were removed, and the distal tip of the dual-port Port-A-Cath was threaded over the sheath, which was simultaneously withdrawn.  Both ports of the dual-port Port-A-Cath were flushed and aspirated without difficulty.  The distal tip was confirmed to be in adequate position with surgeon-interpreted fluoroscopy.  The wire access site was closed with a 4-0 Monocryl.  The port pocket was closed in 2 layers with 2-0 Vicryl followed by 4-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the PACU in good condition","[doctor] hi there. how are you feeling after the procedure?

OPERATION:
Right subclavian Port-a-Cath insertion.
FINDINGS AND PROCEDURE:
With the patient under satisfactory general orotracheal anesthesia and in the supine position, the right upper anterior chest, neck, and arm were prepared with Betadine in the usual fashion.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and fascia of the pectoralis major muscle medially beneath the inferior third of the right clavicle was infiltrated with 0.5% Marcaine with epinephrine.  An incision transverse, parallel, and inferior to the middle third of the right clavicle was performed.  A subcutaneous pocket on the surface of the pectoralis major muscle was created.  The muscular fascia was also infiltrated with 0.5% Marcaine with epinephrine.  With the patient in the Trendelenburg position, utilizing the provided introducer needle, the right subclavian vein was cannulated.  A guidewire was passed without difficulty and the needle was removed.  Fluoroscopy confirmed satisfactory position of the guidewire in the right atrium.  A dilator and sheath was passed over the guidewire.  The guidewire and dilator were removed and a provided catheter was inserted through the sheath and the sheath was carefully withdrawn.  Fluoroscopy again confirmed satisfactory position of the catheter and the catheter under fluoroscopic guidance was retracted into the superior vena cava.  The catheter had been preflushed with dilute heparin solution (100 units/mL).  The port, which had been preflushed with saline, was attached to the catheter at approximately 13 cm level.  The locking cap had been placed on the catheter.  The port was connected to the catheter and the locking cap was secured.  The port was again flushed with dilute heparin solution and placed within the subcutaneous pocket.  Fluoroscopy again confirmed satisfactory position.  A hard copy of the fluoroscopy was obtained.  The catheter and port were secured to the pectoralis fascia in four locations with 2-0 Prolene suture.  Site was irrigated with saline.  Hemostasis was verified.  The subcutaneous tissue was approximated with interrupted 2-0 Vicryl suture.  The subcutaneous and dermis were closed with a running subcuticular 3-0 Vicryl suture.  A 0.25-inch Steri-Strips were applied.  The provided needle and butterfly attachment was flushed with saline, passed through the skin into the port, and then flushed again with dilute heparin solution thus confirmed satisfactory.  The site was dressed with Tegaderm type dressing and the needle catheters were covered with 4x4's and paper tape.  Estimated blood loss was less than 15 mL.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the operating room in good condition.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the procedure?

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
Papillary carcinoma of the follicular variant of the thyroid in the right lobe, status post right hemithyroidectomy.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
Papillary carcinoma of the follicular variant of the thyroid in the right lobe, status post right hemithyroidectomy.
PROCEDURE:
The patient with left completion hemithyroidectomy and reimplantation of the left parathyroid and left sternocleidomastoid region in the inferior 1/3rd region.
FINDINGS:
Normal-appearing thyroid gland with a possible lump in the inferior aspect, there was a parathyroid gland that by frozen section _________  was not thyroid, it was reimplanted to the left lower sternocleidomastoid region.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
Approximately 10 mL.
FLUIDS:
Crystalloid only.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
DRAINS:
Rubber band drain in the neck.
CONDITION:
Stable.
PROCEDURE:
The patient placed supine under general anesthesia.  First, a shoulder roll was placed, 1% lidocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected into the old scar, natural skin fold, and Betadine prep.  Sterile dressing was placed.  The laryngeal monitoring was noted to be working fine.  Then, an incision was made in this area in a curvilinear fashion through the old scar, taken through the fat and the platysma level.  The strap muscles were found and there was scar tissue along the trachea and the strap muscles were elevated off of the left thyroid, the thyroid gland was then found.  Then, using bipolar cautery and a Coblation dissector, the thyroid gland inferiorly was dissected off and the parathyroid gland was left inferiorly and there was scar tissue that was released and laterally, the thyroid gland was released, then came into the Berry ligaments.  The Berry ligament was dissected off and the gland came off all the way to the superior and inferior thyroid vessels, which were crossed with the Harmonic scalpel and removed.  No bleeding was seen.  There was a small nick in the external jugular vein that was tied with a 4-0 Vicryl suture ligature.  After this was completed, on examining the specimen, there appeared to be a lobule on it and it was sent off as possibly parathyroid, therefore it was reimplanted in the left lower sternocleidomastoid region using the silk suture ligature.  After this was completed, no bleeding was seen.  The laryngeal nerve could be seen and intact and then Rubber band  drain was placed throughout the neck along the thyroid bed and 4-0 Vicryl was used to close the strap muscles in an interrupted fashion along with the platysma region and subcutaneous region and a running 5-0 nylon was used to close the skin and Mastisol and Steri-Strips were placed along the skin edges and then on awakening, both laryngeal nerves were working normally.  Procedure was then terminated at that time.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the surgery?

[doctor] alright, and during the procedure, you were placed under general anesthesia and the doctors made an incision through the old scar, then dissected the thyroid gland off the parathyroid gland and the berry ligament. the superior and inferior thyroid vessels were then crossed with the harmonic scalpel and removed. there was a small nick in the external jugular vein that was tied with a suture ligature. the laryngeal nerve was seen and intact, and a rubber band drain was placed along the thyroid bed. does that sound familiar to what you were told before the surgery?
[patient] um, yes, that's what they told me would happen.
[doctor] great. and it says here that you had a stable condition and no complications during the surgery. that's good news. is there anything else you wanted to ask me about the procedure?
[patient] um, i think that covers it. thank you for going over everything with me.
[doctor] of course. we'll keep an eye on your recovery and make sure everything is healing properly. if you have any concerns, don't hesitate to let us know.",1

This is a 55-year-old female who presents with anal cancer, who is beginning chemoradiation and needs IV access for chemotherapy.  Risks and benefits of the procedure explained, the patient appeared to understand, and agreed to proceed.  The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in supine position.  General LMA anesthesia was administered.  She is prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  She was placed in the Trendelenburg position and the left subclavian vein was cannulated and a guide wire placed through the wire.  Fluoroscopy was used to confirm appropriate guide wire location in the subclavian vein to the superior vena cava.  The incision was then made around the guide wire, taken to the subcutaneous tissues with electric Bovie cautery.  A pocket was made in the subcutaneous tissue of adequate size for the port which was cut at 16 cm for appropriate locationing which was cut at 16 cm based on superficial measurements.  The 2-0 Vicryl sutures were used to secure the port in place and the sheath introducer was placed over the guide wire and the guide wire removed with a Port catheter being placed into the sheath introducer.  Fluoroscopy was used to confirm appropriate positioning of the catheter and the skin was closed using interrupted 3-0 Vicryl followed by running 4-0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch.  Heparin flush was used to flush the port.  Steri-Strips were applied and the patient was awakened and extubated in the OR taken to the PACU in good condition.  All counts were reported as correct and I was present for the entire procedure.","[doctor] hi there. how are you feeling after the procedure?

PROCEDURE:
Port insertion through the right subclavian vein percutaneously under radiological guidance.
PROCEDURE DETAIL:
The patient was electively taken to the operating room after obtaining an informed consent.  A time-out process was followed.  Antibiotics were given.  Then, the patient's right deltopectoral area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Xylocaine 1% was infiltrated.  The right subclavian vein was percutaneously cannulated without any difficulty.  Then using the Seldinger technique, the catheter part of the port, which was a single-lumen port, was passed through the introducer under x-ray guidance and placed in the junction of the superior vena cava and the right atrium.
A pocket had been fashioned and a single-lumen drum of the port was connected to the catheter, which had been trimmed and affixed to the pectoralis fascia with couple of sutures of Vicryl.  Then, the fascia was closed using subcuticular suture of Monocryl.  The drum was aspirated and irrigated with heparinized saline and then was put in the pocket and the skin was closed.  A dressing was applied including the needle and the port with the catheter so that the floor could use the catheter right away.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to recovery room in satisfactory condition.  A chest x-ray was performed that showed that there were no complications of procedure and that the catheter was in right place.","[doctor] hi there! how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] hello doctor, i am feeling much better. thank you for asking.

"TITLE OF OPERATION:
Transnasal transsphenoidal approach in resection of pituitary tumor.
INDICATION FOR SURGERY:
The patient is a 17-year-old girl who presented with headaches and was found to have a prolactin of 200 and pituitary tumor.  She was started on Dostinex with increasing dosages.  The most recent MRI demonstrated an increased growth with hemorrhage.  This was then discontinued.  Most recent prolactin was at 70, although normalized, the recommendation was surgical resection given the size of the sellar lesion.  All the risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained in great detail via translator.
PREOP DIAGNOSIS:
Pituitary tumor.
POSTOP DIAGNOSIS:
Pituitary tumor.
PROCEDURE DETAIL:
The patient brought to the operating room, positioned on the horseshoe headrest in a neutral position supine.  The fluoroscope was then positioned.  The approach will be dictated by Dr. X. Once the operating microscope and the endoscope were then used to approach it through transnasal, this was complicated and complex secondary to the drilling within the sinus.  Once this was ensured, the tumor was identified, separated from the pituitary gland, it was isolated and then removed.  It appeared to be hemorrhagic and a necrotic pituitary, several sections were sent.  Once this was ensured and completed and hemostasis obtained, the wound was irrigated.  There might have been a small CSF leak with Valsalva, so the recommendation was for a reconstruction, Dr. X will dictate.  The fat graft was harvested from the left lower quadrant and closed primarily, this was soaked in fat and used to close the closure.  All sponge and needle counts were correct.  The patient was extubated and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.  Blood loss was minimal.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after your surgery?
[patient] i'm feeling a little groggy, but not too bad.
[doctor] that's to be expected. the surgery went well, and i wanted to explain a bit more about what we did.
[patient] okay.
[doctor] so, we performed a transnasal transsphenoidal approach to remove a pituitary tumor. we used a microscope and an endoscope to approach the tumor through your nose. the surgery was complicated and complex due to some drilling within the sinus, but we were able to successfully remove the tumor.
[patient] was the tumor cancerous?
[doctor] we're not sure yet. several sections were sent for further analysis. the tumor appeared to be hemorrhagic and necrotic, but we won't have a definitive answer until we receive the results.
[patient] okay, i understand.
[doctor] during the surgery, there was a small csf leak with valsalva, so we'll need to perform a reconstruction. dr. x will dictate the specifics of that, but we used a fat graft harvested from your left lower quadrant to help with the closure.
[patient] will that be painful?
[doctor] you may experience some discomfort, but we'll provide you with pain medication to help manage that. overall, the surgery went well and we were able to remove the tumor without any major complications. you'll need to rest and take it easy for a while, but you should start feeling better soon.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
Cervical spondylosis, status post complex anterior cervical discectomy, corpectomy, decompression and fusion.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
Cervical spondylosis, status post complex anterior cervical discectomy, corpectomy, decompression and fusion, and potentially unstable cervical spine.
OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:
Application of PMT large halo crown and vest.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
None.
ANESTHESIA:
Local, conscious sedation with Morphine and Versed.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.  Post-fixation x-rays, nonalignment, no new changes.  Post-fixation neurologic examination normal.
CLINICAL HISTORY:
The patient is a 41-year-old female who presented to me with severe cervical spondylosis and myelopathy.  She was referred to me by Dr. X.  The patient underwent a complicated anterior cervical discectomy, 2-level corpectomy, spinal cord decompression and fusion with fibular strut and machine allograft in the large cervical plate.  Surgery had gone well, and the patient has done well in the last 2 days.  She is neurologically improved and is moving all four extremities.  No airway issues.  It was felt that the patient was now a candidate for a halo vest placement given that chance of going to the OR were much smaller.  She was consented for the procedure, and I sought the help of ABC and felt that a PMT halo would be preferable to a Bremer halo vest.  The patient had this procedure done at the bedside, in the SICU room #1.  I used a combination of some morphine 1 mg and Versed 2 mg for this procedure.  I also used local anesthetic, with 1% Xylocaine and epinephrine a total of 15 to 20 cc.
PROCEDURE DETAILS:
The patient's head was positioned on some towels, the retroauricular region was shaved, and the forehead and the posterolateral periauricular regions were prepped with Betadine.  A large PMT crown was brought in and fixed to the skull with pins under local anesthetic.  Excellent fixation achieved.  It was lateral to the supraorbital nerves and 1 fingerbreadth above the brows and the ear pinnae.
I then put the vest on, by sitting the patient up, stabilizing her neck.  The vest was brought in from the front as well and connected.  Head was tilted appropriately, slightly extended, and in the midline.  All connections were secured and pins were torqued and tightened.
During the procedure, the patient did fine with no significant pain.
Post-procedure, she is neurologically intact and she remained intact throughout.  X-rays of the cervical spine AP, lateral, and swimmer views showed excellent alignment of the hardware construct in the graft with no new changes.
The patient will be subjected to a CT scan to further define the alignment, and barring any problems, she will be ambulating with the halo on.
The patient will undergo pin site care as per protocol, and likely she will go in the next 2 to 3 days.  Her prognosis indeed is excellent, and she is already about 90% or so better from her surgery.  She is also on a short course of Decadron, which we will wean off in due course.
The matter was discussed with the patient and the patient's family.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?
[patient] i'm doing okay, a little sore.
[doctor] that's to be expected. so, i wanted to talk to you about the procedure we did to stabilize your cervical spine.

Large recurrent right pleural effusion.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Large recurrent right pleural effusion.
PROCEDURE:
1.  Conscious sedation.
2.  Chest tube talc pleurodesis of the right chest.
INDICATIONS:
The patient is a 65-year-old lady with a history of cirrhosis who has developed a recurrent large right pleural effusion.  Chest catheter had been placed previously, and she had been draining up to 1.5 liters of serous fluid a day.  Eventually, this has decreased and a talc pleurodesis is being done to see her pleural effusion does not recur.

None.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
Zero.
NARRATIVE:
After obtaining informed consent from the patient and her daughter, the patient was assessed and found to be in good condition and a good candidate for conscious sedation.  Vital signs were taken.  These were stable, so the patient was then given initially 0.5 mg of Versed and 2 mg of morphine IV.  After a couple of minutes, she was assessed and found to be awake but calm, so then the chest tube was clamped and then through the chest tube a solution of 120 mL of normal saline containing 5 g of talc and 40 mg of lidocaine were then put into her right chest taking care that no air would go in to create a pneumothorax.  She was then laid on her left lateral decubitus position for 5 minutes and then turned into the right lateral decubitus position for 5 minutes and then the chest tube was unclamped.  The patient was given additional 0.5 mg of Versed and 0.5 mg of Dilaudid IV achieving a state where the patient was comfortable but readily responsive.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  She did complain of up to a 7/10 pain, but quickly this was brought under control.  The chest tube was unclamped.  Now, the patient will be left to rest and she will get a chest x-ray in the morning.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the procedure?

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Left hemothorax, rule out empyema.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Left hemothorax rule out empyema.
PROCEDURE:
Insertion of a 12-French pigtail catheter in the left pleural space.
PROCEDURE DETAIL:
After obtaining informed consent, the patient was taken to the minor OR in the Same Day Surgery where his posterior left chest was prepped and draped in a usual fashion.  Xylocaine 1% was injected and then a 12-French pigtail catheter was inserted in the medial scapular line about the eighth intercostal space.  It was difficult to draw fluid by syringe, but we connected the system to a plastic bag and by gravity started draining at least 400 mL while we were in the minor OR.  Samples were sent for culture and sensitivity, aerobic and anaerobic.
The patient and I decided to admit him for a period of observation at least overnight.
He tolerated the procedure well and the postprocedure chest x-ray showed no complications.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] i'm a little sore, but i'm doing okay.

[patient] okay, what happens next?
[doctor] you and i decided it would be best for you to stay overnight for observation. we want to make sure there are no complications and that the fluid doesn't continue to build up. the post-procedure chest x-ray looked good, so that's a good sign. 
[patient] makes sense. is there anything i need to do while i'm here?
[doctor] just relax and rest. we'll be monitoring your vitals and making sure everything is stable. you may feel some soreness at the site where the catheter was inserted, but that should improve over time. we'll also be keeping an eye on the fluid drainage and any lab results that come back. 
[patient] okay, sounds good. 
[doctor] if you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to let me or the nursing staff know. we want to make sure you're as comfortable as possible. 
[patient] thanks, i appreciate the care.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES):
Cataract, right eye.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES):
Cataract, right eye.
PROCEDURE:
Right phacoemulsification of cataract with intraocular lens implantation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION:
Under topical anesthesia with monitored anesthesia care, the patient was prepped, draped and positioned under the operating microscope. A lid speculum was applied to the right eye, and a stab incision into the anterior chamber was done close to the limbus at about the 1 o'clock position with a Superblade, and Xylocaine 1% preservative free 0.25 mL was injected into the anterior chamber, which was then followed by Healon to deepen the anterior chamber. Using a keratome, another stab incision was done close to the limbus at about the 9 o'clock position and with the Utrata forceps, anterior capsulorrhexis was performed, and the torn anterior capsule was totally removed. Hydrodissection and hydrodelineation were performed with the tuberculin syringe filled with BSS. The tip of the phaco unit was introduced into the anterior chamber, and anterior sculpting of the nucleus was performed until about more than two-thirds of the nucleus was removed. Using the phaco tip and the Drysdale hook, the nucleus was broken up into 4 pieces and then phacoemulsified.
The phaco tip was then exchanged for the aspiration/irrigation tip, and cortical materials were aspirated. Posterior capsule was polished with a curette polisher, and Healon was injected into the capsular bag. Using the Monarch intraocular lens inserter, the posterior chamber intraocular lens model SN60WF power +19.50 was placed into the inserter after applying some Healon, and the tip of the inserter was gently introduced through the cornea tunnel wound, into the capsular bag and then the intraocular lens was then inserted inferior haptic first into the back and the superior haptic was placed into the bag with the same instrument. Intraocular lens was then rotated about half a turn with a collar button hook. Healon was removed with the aspiration/irrigation tip, and balanced salt solution was injected through the side port to deepen the anterior chamber. It was found that there was no leakage of fluid through the cornea tunnel wound. For this reason, no suture was applied. Vigamox, Econopred and Nevanac eye drops were instilled and the eye was covered with a perforated shield. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no complications.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling?
[patient] a little groggy, but i'm okay.
[doctor] that's normal. the procedure went well. you had phacoemulsification of cataract with intraocular lens implantation in your right eye. do you have any questions?

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
The patient was identified.  The operative eye was treated with tetracaine 1% topically in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was taken to the operating room and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for ophthalmic surgery.
Attention was turned to the left/right eye.  The lashes were tapped using Steri-Strips to prevent blinking.  A lid speculum was placed to prevent lid closure.  Anesthesia was verified.  Then, a 3.5-mm groove was created with a diamond blade temporarily.  This was beveled with a crescent blade, and the anterior chamber was entered with a 3.2-mm keratome in the iris plane.  A 1% nonpreserved lidocaine was injected intracamerally and followed with Viscoat.  A paracentesis was made.  A round capsulorrhexis was performed.  The anterior capsular flap was removed.  Hydrodelineation and dissection were followed by phacoemulsification of the cataract using a chop technique.  The irrigating-aspirating machine was used to clear residual cortex.  The Provisc was instilled.  An SN60WS diopter intraocular lens was inserted into the capsular bag, and the position was verified.  The viscoelastic was removed.  Intraocular lens remained well centered.  The incision was hydrated, and the anterior chamber pressure was checked with tactile pressure and found to be normal.  The anterior chamber remained deep, and there was no wound leak.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The eye was dressed with Maxitrol ointment.  A tight patch and Fox shield were placed.

"PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
PICC line insertion.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
The patient was identified by myself on presentation to the angiography suite.  His right arm was prepped and draped in sterile fashion from the antecubital fossa up.  Under ultrasound guidance, a #21-gauge needle was placed into his right cephalic vein.  A guidewire was then threaded through the vein and advanced without difficulty.  An introducer was then placed over the guidewire.  We attempted to manipulate the guidewire to the superior vena cava; however, we could not pass the point of the subclavian vein and we tried several maneuvers and then opted to do a venogram.  What we did was we injected approximately 4 mL of Visipaque 320 contrast material through the introducer and did a mapping venogram and it turned out that the cephalic vein was joining into the subclavian vein.  It was very tortuous area.  We made several more attempts using the mapping system to pass the glide over that area, but we were unable to do that.  Decision was made at that point then to just do a midline catheter.  The catheter was cut to 20 cm, then we inserted back to the introducer.  The introducer was removed.  The catheter was secured by two #3-0 silk sutures.  Appropriate imaging was then taken.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure nicely and was discharged from Angiography in satisfactory condition back to the general floor.  We may make another attempt in the near future using a different approach.

PROS DEV IMPLANT:
ABC Laboratories posterior chamber intraocular lens, 21.0 diopters, serial number 123456.
NARRATIVE:
Informed consent was obtained.  All questions were answered.  The patient was brought to preoperative holding area where the operative right eye was marked.  He was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  EKG leads were placed.  General anesthesia was induced by the anesthesia service.  A time-out was called to confirm the procedure and operative eye.  The right operative eye was disinfected and draped in a standard fashion for eye surgery.  A lid speculum was placed.  The vitreoretinal team placed the infusion cannula after performing a peritomy.  At this point in the case, the patient was turned over to the cornea service with Mrs. Jun.  A paracentesis was made at the approximately 3 o'clock position.  Healon was placed into the anterior chamber.  The diamond keratome was used to make a vertical groove incision just inside the limbus at the 108-degree axis.  This incision was then shelved anteriorly and used to enter the anterior chamber.  The Utrata forceps were used to complete a continuous circular capsulorrhexis after incision of the capsule with the cystotome.  Hydrodissection was performed.  The lens nucleus was removed using phacoemulsification and irrigation and aspiration.  Lens cortex also was removed using irrigation and aspiration.  Viscoelastic was placed to inflate the capsular remnant.  The diamond knife was used to enlarge the phaco incision.  Intraocular lens was selected from preoperative calculations, placed in the injector system, and inserted into the capsule without difficulty.  The trailing haptic was placed using the Sheets forceps and the Barraquer sweep to push the IOL optic posteriorly as the trailing haptic was placed.  The anterior cornea wound was sutured along with the paracentesis after irrigation and aspiration was performed to remove remaining viscoelastic from the anterior chamber.  This was done without difficulty.  The anterior chamber was secured and watertight at the end of the procedure.  Intraocular pressure was satisfactory.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and then was turned over to the retina service in good condition.  They will dictate a separate note.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after your surgery?

"PROCEDURE:
Phacoemulsification with posterior chamber intraocular lens insertion.
INTRAOCULAR LENS:
Allergan Medical Optics model S140MB XXX diopter chamber lens.
PHACO TIME:
Not known.
ANESTHESIA:
Retrobulbar block with local minimal anesthesia care.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
None.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
While the patient was in the holding area, the operative eye was dilated with four sets of drops.  The drops consisted of Cyclogyl 1%, Acular, and Neo-Synephrine 2.5 %.  Additionally, a peripheral IV was established by the anesthesia team.  Once the eye was dilated, the patient was wheeled to the operating suite.
Inside the operating suite, central monitoring lines were established.  Through the peripheral IV, the patient received intravenous sedation consisting of Propofol and once somnolent from this, retrobulbar block was administered consisting of 2 cc's of 2% Xylocaine  plain with 150 units of Wydase.  The block was administered in a retrobulbar fashion using an Atkinson needle and a good block was obtained.  Digital pressure was applied for approximately five minutes.
The patient was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for ophthalmological surgery.  A Betadine prep was carried out of the face, lids, and eye.  During the draping process, care was taken to isolate the lashes.  A wire lid speculum was inserted to maintain patency of the lids.  With benefit of the operating microscope, a diamond blade was used to place a groove temporally.  A paracentesis wound was also placed temporally using the same blade.  Viscoelastic was then instilled into the anterior chamber through the paracentesis site and a 2.8 mm. diamond keratome was used to enter the anterior chamber through the previously placed groove.  The cystotome was then inserted into the eye and circular capsulorhexis was performed without difficulty.  The capsular remnant was withdrawn from the eye using long angled McPherson forceps.  Balanced salt solution with a blunt cannula was then inserted into the eye and hydrodissection was performed.  The lens was noted to rotate freely within the capsular bag.  The phaco instrument was then inserted into the eye using the Kelman tip.  The lens nucleus was grooved and broken into two halves.  One of the halves was in turn broken into quarters.  Each of the quarters was removed from the eye using the memory 2 settings and phacoemulsification.  Attention was then turned toward the remaining half of the nucleus and this, in turn, was removed as well, with the splitting maneuver.  Once the nucleus had been removed from the eye, the irrigating and aspirating tip was inserted and the cortical material was stripped out in sections.  Once the cortical material had been completely removed, a diamond dusted cannula was inserted into the eye and the posterior capsule was polished.  Viscoelastic was again instilled into the capsular bag as well as the anterior chamber.  The wound was enlarged slightly using the diamond keratome.  The above described intraocular lens was folded outside the eye using a mustache fold and inserted using folding forceps.  Once inside the eye, the lens was unfolded into the capsular bag in a single maneuver.  It was noted to be centered nicely.  The viscoelastic was then withdrawn from the eye using the irrigating and aspirating tip of the phaco machine.
Next, Miostat was instilled into the operative eye and the wound was checked for water tightness.  It was found to be such.  After removing the drapes and speculum, TobraDex drops were instilled into the operative eye and a gauze patch and Fox protective shield were placed over the eye.

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Osteomyelitis, right hallux.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Osteomyelitis, right hallux.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
Amputation distal phalanx and partial proximal phalanx, right hallux.
ANESTHESIA:
TIVA/local.
HISTORY:
This 44-year-old male patient was admitted to ABCD General Hospital on 09/02/2003 with a diagnosis of osteomyelitis of the right hallux and cellulitis of the right lower extremity.  The patient has a history of diabetes and has had a chronic ulceration to the right hallux and has been on outpatient antibiotics, which he failed.  The patient after a multiple conservative treatments such as wound care antibiotics, the patient was given the option of amputation as a treatment for the chronic resistant osteomyelitis.  The patient desires to attempt a surgical correction.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure were discussed with the patient in detail by Dr. X.  The consent was available on the chart for review.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operating table in the supine position, a safety strap was placed across his waist.  Adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia and a total of 3.5 cc of 1:1 mixture 1% lidocaine and 0.5% Marcaine plain were injected into the right hallux as a digital block.  The foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion lowering the operative field.
Attention was directed to the hallux where there was a full-thickness ulceration to the distal tip of the hallux measuring 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm.  There was a ________ tract, which probed through the distal phalanx and along the sides of the proximal phalanx laterally.  The toe was 2.5 times to the normal size.  There were superficial ulcerations in the medial arch of both feet secondary to history of a burn, which were not infected.  The patient had dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses that were found to be +2/4 bilaterally preoperatively.  X-ray revealed complete distraction of the distal phalanx and questionable distraction of the lateral aspect of the proximal phalanx.  A #10 blade was used to make an incision down the bone in a transverse fashion just proximal to the head of the proximal phalanx.  The incision was carried mediolaterally and plantarly encompassing the toe leaving a large amount of plantar skin intact.  Next, the distal phalanx was disarticulated at the interphalangeal joint and removed.  The distal toe was amputated and sent to laboratory for bone culture and sensitivity as well as tissue pathology.  Next, the head of the proximal phalanx was inspected and found to be soft on the distal lateral portion as suspected.  Therefore, a sagittal saw was used to resect approximately 0.75 cm of the distal aspect of head of the proximal phalanx.  This bone was also sent off for culture and was labeled proximal margin.  Next, the flexor hallucis longus tendon was identified and retracted as far as possible distally and transected.  The flexor tendon distally was gray discolored and was not viable.  A hemostat was used to inspect the flexor sheath to ensure no infection tracking up the sheath proximally.  None was found.  No purulent drainage or abscess was found.  The proximal margin of the surgical site tissue was viable and healthy.  There was no malodor.  Anaerobic and aerobic cultures were taken and passed this as a specimen to microbiology.  Next, copious amounts of gentamicin and impregnated saline were instilled into the wound.
A #3-0 Vicryl was used to reapproximate the deep subcutaneous layer to release skin tension.  The plantar flap was viable and was debulked with Metzenbaum scissors.  The flap was folded dorsally and reapproximated carefully with #3-0 nylon with a combination of simple interrupted and vertical mattress sutures.  Iris scissors were used to modify and remodel the plantar flap.  An excellent cosmetic result was achieved.  No tourniquet was used in this case.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and surgery without apparent complications.  A standard postoperative dressing was applied consisting of saline-soaked Owen silk, 4x4s, Kerlix, and Coban.  The patient was transported via cart to Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs able and vascular status intact to right foot.  He will be readmitted to Dr. Katzman where we will continue to monitor his blood pressure and regulate his medications.  Plan is to continue the antibiotics until further IV recommendations.
He will be nonweightbearing to the right foot and use crutches.  He will elevate his right foot and rest the foot, keep it clean and dry.  He is to follow up with Dr. X on Monday or Tuesday of next week.","[doctor] hello, how are you feeling after the surgery?
[patient] hi, i am feeling alright, a little bit of pain but it's manageable.
[doctor] ok, that's good to hear. i just want to go over the details of the surgery you had. we had to amputate the distal phalanx and a partial proximal phalanx of your right hallux due to osteomyelitis and cellulitis. we injected a digital block on your right hallux to help with the pain during the procedure. 
[patient] yes, i remember that. 
[doctor] the surgery went well and we removed the infected bone and tissue. we also sent it to the lab for further testing. we checked your pulses and they were found to be +2/4 bilaterally preoperatively. we used gentamicin and impregnated saline to clean the wound and the plantar flap was reapproximated with sutures. 
[patient] alright, thank you for explaining that doctor. 
[doctor] you will need to continue your antibiotics until further iv recommendations and will be nonweightbearing to the right foot and use crutches. rest your foot, keep it clean and dry, and elevate it. follow up with dr. x on monday or tuesday of next week. do you have any questions?

"PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
Phacoemulsification with intraocular lens placement.
ANESTHESIA TYPE:
Topical.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
The patient was brought to the operating room after the eye was dilated with topical Mydriacyl and Neo-Synephrine eye drops.  Topical anesthetic drops were applied to the eye just prior to entering the operating room.  The eye was then prepped with a 5% Betadine solution injected in the usual sterile fashion.  A wire speculum was placed in the eye and then a clear corneal paracentesis site was made inferiorly with a 15-degree blade.  Lidocaine 1% preservative-free, 0.1 cc, was instilled into the anterior chamber through the clear corneal paracentesis site and this was followed with viscoelastic to fill the chamber.  A 2.8-mm keratome was used to create a self-sealing corneal incision temporally and then a bent capsulotomy needle was used to create an anterior capsular flap.  The Utrata forceps were used to complete a continuous tear capsulorrhexis, and hydrodissection and hydrodelineation of the nucleus was performed with BSS on a cannula.  Phacoemulsification in a quartering and cracking technique was used to remove the nucleus, and then the residual cortex was removed with the irrigation and aspiration unit.  Gentle vacuuming of the central posterior capsule was performed with the irrigation and aspiration unit.  The capsular bag was re-expanded with viscoelastic, and then the wound was opened to a 3.4-mm size to accommodate the intraocular lens insertion using an additional keratome blade.
The lens was folded, inserted into the capsular bag and then unfolded.  The trailing haptic was tucked underneath the anterior capsular rim.  The lens was shown to center very well.  The viscoelastic was removed with the irrigation and aspiration unit and one 10-0 nylon suture was placed across the incision after Miochol was injected into the anterior chamber to cause pupillary constriction.  The wound was shown to be watertight.  Therefore, TobraDex ointment was applied to the eye, an eye pad loosely applied, and a Fox shield taped firmly in place over the eye.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the operating room in good condition.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after the procedure?

ANESTHESIA:
Retrobulbar block.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
The patient was brought to the operating room where retrobulbar anesthesia was induced.  The patient was then prepped and draped using standard procedure.  A wire lid speculum was inserted to keep the eye open and the eye rotated downward with a 0.12.  The anterior chamber was entered by making a small superior limbal incision with a crescent blade and then entering the anterior chamber with a keratome.  The chamber was then filled with viscoelastic and a continuous-tear capsulorrhexis performed.  The phacoemulsification was then instilled in the eye and a linear incision made in the lens.  The lens was then cracked with a McPherson forceps, and the remaining lens material removed with the phacoemulsification tip.  The remaining cortex was removed with an I&A.  The capsular bag was then inflated with viscoelastic and the wound extended slightly with the keratome.  The folding posterior chamber lens was then inserted in the capsular bag and rotated into position.  The remaining viscoelastic was removed from the eye with the I&A.  The wound was checked for watertightness and found to be watertight.  Tobramycin drops were instilled in the eye and a shield placed over it.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.","[doctor] hi there. how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] hello. i feel pretty good, a little blurry in the right eye, but otherwise okay.
[doctor] that's to be expected, but the blurriness should subside over the next few days. the surgery went well, and we were able to successfully remove the cataract from your right eye.
[patient] that's great to hear.
[doctor] we used a technique called phacoemulsification with intraocular lens insertion. during the procedure, we made a small incision in your eye and used a special tool to break up and remove the cloudy lens. we then replaced it with a clear, artificial lens to help improve your vision. 
[patient] interesting. did everything go smoothly during the surgery?
[doctor] yes, everything went exactly as planned. there were no complications, and the wound was found to be watertight. you received a retrobulbar block anesthesia which numbed the area around your eye.
[patient] that's good to hear. what's next for me?

[doctor] of course, don't hesitate to contact us if you notice any changes in your vision or experience any pain.","[doctor] hey, how are you feeling after the procedure?
[patient] um, hello! i'm feeling pretty good, a little blurry in my right eye, but otherwise okay.
[doctor] mm-hmm, that's to be expected. but the blurriness should subside over the next few days. the surgery went well, and we were able to successfully remove the cataract from your right eye.
[patient] oh, great to hear that!
[doctor] we used a technique called phacoemulsification with intraocular lens insertion. during the procedure, we made a small incision in your eye and used a special tool to break up and remove the cloudy lens. we then replaced it with a clear, artificial lens to help improve your vision.
[patient] ah, interesting. did everything go smoothly during the surgery?
[doctor] yes, everything went exactly as planned. there were no complications, and the wound was found to be watertight. you received a retrobulbar block anesthesia which numbed the area around your eye.
[patient] oh, okay. what's next for me now?
[doctor] for the next few days, you'll need to use eye drops to help prevent infection and reduce inflammation. you will also need to wear an eye shield while sleeping to protect the eye. we'll schedule a follow-up appointment in a week to check on your progress and make sure everything is healing well.
[patient] alrighty then, thank you, doctor.
[doctor] of course, don't hesitate to contact us if you notice any changes in your vision or experience any pain.",1
"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Cataract, right eye.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Cataract, right eye.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
Cataract extraction via phacoemulsification with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation.  An Alcon MA30BA lens was used, * diopters, #*.
ANESTHESIA:
Topical 4% lidocaine with 1% nonpreserved intracameral lidocaine.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
PROCEDURE:
Prior to surgery, the patient was counseled as to the risks, benefits and alternatives of the procedure with risks including, but not limited to, bleeding, infection, loss of vision, loss of the eye, need for a second surgery, retinal detachment and retinal swelling.  The patient understood the risks clearly and wished to proceed.
The patient was brought into the operating suite after being given dilating drops.  Topical 4% lidocaine drops were used.  The patient was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  A lid speculum was placed into the right eye.  Paracentesis was made at the infratemporal quadrant.  This was followed by 1% nonpreservative lidocaine into the anterior chamber, roughly 250 microliters.  This was exchanged for Viscoat solution.  Next, a crescent blade was used to create a partial-thickness linear groove at the temporal limbus.  This was followed by a clear corneal bevel incision with a 3 mm metal keratome blade.  Circular capsulorrhexis was initiated with a cystitome and completed with Utrata forceps.  Balanced salt solution was used to hydrodissect the nucleus.  Nuclear material was removed via phacoemulsification with divide-and-conquer technique.  The residual cortex was removed via irrigation and aspiration.  The capsular bag was then filled with Provisc solution.  The wound was slightly enlarged.  The lens was folded and inserted into the capsular bag.
Residual Provisc solution was irrigated out of the eye.  The wound was stromally hydrated and noted to be completely self-sealing.
At the end of the case, the posterior capsule was intact.  The lens was well centered in the capsular bag.  The anterior chamber was deep.  The wound was self sealed and subconjunctival injections of Ancef, dexamethasone and lidocaine were given inferiorly.  Maxitrol ointment was placed into the eye.  The eye was patched with a shield.
The patient was transported to the recovery room in stable condition to follow up the following morning.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling after your cataract surgery?
[patient] i'm feeling alright, a little groggy still.
[doctor] that's understandable, you just had a procedure done. before we get into the details, did you experience any complications during the surgery or after?
[patient] no, everything seemed to go smoothly.
[doctor] great to hear. so during the surgery, we used a phacoemulsification technique to remove the cataract in your right eye, followed by implanting an alcon ma30ba lens. we used a topical 4% lidocaine with 1% nonpreserved intracameral lidocaine for anesthesia. you were counseled about the risks and benefits of the procedure beforehand and you understood them clearly. how has your vision been since the procedure?
[patient] my vision is still a little blurry, but i can already tell it's better than before the surgery.
[doctor] that's a good sign. we used viscoat solution and provisc solution during the procedure to assist with the removal and insertion of the lens. we also made sure to keep the posterior capsule intact, and the lens is well-centered in the capsular bag. we applied subconjunctival injections of ancef, dexamethasone and lidocaine and maxitrol ointment to aid in your recovery. we'll schedule a follow-up appointment for you tomorrow to make sure everything is healing properly.
[patient] okay, sounds good. thank you for explaining everything to me.
[doctor] of course, it's important to us that you understand the details of your procedure and recovery. if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment, don't hesitate to contact us.","[doctor] hi there, how's it going after your cataract surgery?

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Visually significant nuclear sclerotic cataract, right eye.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Visually significant nuclear sclerotic cataract, right eye.
OPERATIVE PROCEDURES:
Phacoemulsification with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation, right eye.
ANESTHESIA:
Monitored anesthesia care with retrobulbar block consisting of 2% lidocaine in an equal mixture with 0.75% Marcaine and Amphadase.
INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY:
This patient has been experiencing difficulty with eyesight regarding activities of daily living.  There has been a progressive and gradual decline in the visual acuity.  The cataract was believed related to her decline in vision.  The risks, benefits, and alternatives (including with observation or spectacles) were discussed in detail.  The risks as explained included, but are not limited to pain, bleeding, infection, decreased or loss of vision/loss of eye, retinal detachment requiring further surgery, and possible consultation out of town, swelling of the back part of the eye/retina, need for prolonged eye drop use or injections, instability of the lens, and loss of corneal clarity necessitating long-term drop use or further surgery.  The possibility of needing intraocular lens exchange or incorrect lens power was discussed.  Anesthesia option and risks associated with anesthesia and retrobulbar anesthesia were discussed.  It was explained that some or all of these complications might arise at the time of or months to years after surgery.  The patient had a good understanding of the risks with the proposed, elective eye surgery.  The patient accepted these risks and elected to proceed with cataract surgery.  All questions were answered and informed consent was signed and placed in the chart.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
The patient was identified and the procedure was verified.  The pupil was dilated per protocol.  The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  After intravenous sedation, the retrobulbar block was injected followed by several minutes of digital massage.  No signs of orbital tenseness or retrobulbar hemorrhage were present.
The patient was prepped and draped in the usual ophthalmic sterile fashion.  An eyelid speculum was used to separate the eyelids.  A crescent blade was used to make a clear corneal temporally located incision.  A 1-mm Dual-Bevel blade was used to make a paracentesis site.  The anterior chamber was filled with viscoelastic (Viscoat).  The crescent blade was then used to make an approximate 2-mm long clear corneal tunnel through the temporal incision.  A 2.85-mm keratome blade was then used to penetrate into the anterior chamber through the temporal tunneled incision.  A 25-gauge pre-bent cystotome used to begin a capsulorrhexis.  The capsulorrhexis was completed with the Utrata forceps.  A 27-guage needle was used for hydrodissection and three full and complete fluid waves were noted.  The lens was able to be freely rotated within the capsular bag.  Divide-and-conquer ultrasound was used for phacoemulsification.  After four sculpted grooves were made, a bimanual approach with the phacoemulsification tip and Koch spatula was used to separate and crack each grooved segment.  Each of the four nuclear quadrants was phacoemulsified.  Aspiration was used to remove all remaining cortex.  Viscoelastic was used to re-inflate the capsular bag.  An AMO model SI40NB posterior chamber intraocular lens with power *** diopters and serial number *** was injected into the capsular bag.  The trailing haptic was placed with the Sinskey hook.  The lens was made well centered and stable.  Viscoelastic was aspirated.  BSS was used to re-inflate the anterior chamber to an adequate estimated intraocular pressure.  A Weck-Cel sponge was used to check both incision sites for leaks and none were identified.  The incision sites remained well approximated and dry with a well-formed anterior chamber and eccentric posterior chamber intraocular lens.  The eyelid speculum was removed and the patient was cleaned free of Betadine.  Vigamox and Econopred drops were applied.  A soft eye patch followed by a firm eye shield was taped over the operative eye.  The patient was then taken to the Postanesthesia Recovery Unit in good condition having tolerated the procedure well.
Discharge instructions regarding activity restrictions, eye drop use, eye shield/patch wearing, and driving restrictions were discussed.  All questions were answered.  The discharge instructions were also reviewed with the patient by the discharging nurse.  The patient was comfortable and was discharged with followup in 24 hours.  Complications none.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling today?

TITLE OF OPERATION:
Phacoemulsification with intraocular lens insertion, right eye.
ANESTHESIA:
Topical.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
The patient was brought to the operating room where tetracaine drops were instilled in the eye.  The patient was then prepped and draped using standard procedure.  An additional drop of tetracaine was instilled in the eye, and then a lid speculum was inserted.
The eye was rotated downward and a crescent blade used to make an incision at the limbus.  This was then dissected forward approximately 1 mm, and then a keratome was used to enter the anterior chamber.  The anterior chamber was filled with 1% preservative-free lidocaine and the lidocaine was then replaced with Provisc.  A cystotome was used to make a continuous-tear capsulorrhexis, and then the capsular flap was removed with the Utrata forceps.  The lens nucleus was hydrodissected using BSS on a cannula and then removed using the phaco.  This was aided by cracking the lens nucleus with McPherson forceps.  The remaining cortex was removed from the eye with the I&A.  The capsular bag was then polished with the I&A on capsular bag.  The bag was inflated using viscoelastic and then the wound extended slightly with a keratome.  A folding posterior chamber lens was inserted and rotated into position using McPherson forceps.  The I&A was then placed in the eye again and the remaining viscoelastic removed.  The wound was checked for watertightness and found to be watertight.  TobraDex drops were instilled in the eye and a shield was placed over it.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was brought to recovery in good condition.","[doctor] hi, how are you feeling after your surgery?

"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Visually significant cataract, left eye.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Visually significant cataract, left eye.
ANESTHESIA:
Topical/MAC.
PROCEDURE:
Phacoemulsification cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation, left eye (Alcon AcrySof, SN60AT, 23.0 D, serial #***).
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY:
The patient is a 74-year-old woman with complaints of painless progressive loss of vision in her left eye.  She was found to have a visually-significant cataract and, after discussion of the risks, benefits and alternatives to surgery, she elected to proceed with cataract extraction and lens implantation in this eye in efforts to improve her vision.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
The patient was verified in the preoperative holding area and the informed consent was reviewed and verified to be on the chart.  They were transported to the operative suite, accompanied by the anesthesia service, where appropriate cardiopulmonary monitoring was established.  MAC anesthesia was achieved, which was followed by topical anesthesia using 1% preservative-free tetracaine eye drops.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual fashion for sterile ophthalmic surgery and a lid speculum was placed.
Two stab-incision paracenteses were made in the cornea using the MVR blade, and the anterior chamber was irrigated with 1% preservative-free lidocaine for intracameral anesthesia.  The anterior chamber was filled with viscoelastic and a shelved, temporal, clear corneal incision was made using the diamond groove knife and steel keratome.  A continuous curvilinear capsulorrhexis was made in the anterior capsule using the bent-needle cystotome.  The lens nucleus was hydrodissected and hydrodelineated using balanced saline solution (BSS) on a Chang cannula until it rotated freely.
The phacoemulsification handpiece was introduced into the anterior chamber, and the lens nucleus was sculpted into 2 halves.  Each half was further subdivided with chopping and removed with phacoemulsification.  The remaining cortical material was removed with the irrigation and aspiration (I&A) handpiece.  The capsular bag was inflated with viscoelastic and the intraocular lens was injected into the capsule without difficulty.  The remaining viscoelastic was removed with the I&A handpiece, and the anterior chamber was filled to an appropriate intraocular pressure with BSS.  The corneal wounds were hydrated and verified to be water-tight.  Antibiotic ointment was placed, followed by a patch and shield.  The patient was transported to the PACU in good/stable condition.  There were no complications.  Followup is scheduled for tomorrow morning in the eye clinic.
A single interrupted 10-0 nylon suture was placed through the inferotemporal paracentesis to ensure that it was watertight at the end of the case.","[doctor] hi there, how are you feeling?
