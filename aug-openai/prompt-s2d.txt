Your task is to generate a patient conversation that was summarised in the input clinical note.  Stick to the following rules:
1. Keep the conversation colloquial, without using abbreviations and medical jargon.
2. Make sure to include all relevant information from the note, but keep the tone conversational.
3. If any medical terms appear in the note, paraphrase them to lay mans terms. For example, the abbreviation "LBP" should be paraphrased to "lower back pain".
4. Add some interjections that would be normal in a conversation but would not be copied into the clinical note.
