He has been taking Allegra-D intermittently, but he is almost out and he needs a refill.  The second problem, his foot continues to breakout.

I see that he is starting to breakout again now that the weather is warmer and I think that is probably not a coincidence.  He works in the flint and it is really hot where he works and it has been quite humid lately.  The third problem is that he has a wart or a spot that he thinks is a wart on the right middle finger.

Before we begin, could you confirm your age for me?\r\nPatient: I'm twenty five years old. \r\nDoctor: Thank you. Doctor X, could you go over the diagnosis of erythema nodosum?\r\nDoctor_2: She was diagnosed in two thousand and four after a biopsy was done that confirmed erythema nodosum, but the detail from the Netherlands is not that specific. \r\nDoctor: What kind of procedures were done to address it? \r\nDoctor_2: She had undergone a colonoscopy to address secondary diseases that may have been present because of the erythema nodosum, correct miss?\r\nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. \r\nDoctor: Were there any findings, Doctor X? \r\nDoctor_2: The findings were uncertain if the terminal ileum had abnormal biopsies. However, the skin biopsy mentioned some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cells in the subcutis.\r\nDoctor: I see. Her report states something about a tibia and fibula fracture on her right leg before the erythema nodosum. Are these skin lesions due to the fracture? \r\nDoctor_2: The skin lesions are not associated with the fracture, correct ma'am? \r\nPatient: That's correct. The cuts in my skins are on both legs too. Not just the right.\r\nDoctor: Thank you. Did anything occur before the skin lesions? \r\nDoctor_2: She had cosmetic surgery done on her jaw. \r\nDoctor: Ma'am, I see you visited our clinic and the Dermatology several times, correct? \r\nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. I had a rash that I wanted to get checked. \r\nDoctor_2: I remember that. I was here when she presented the rash. We suggested the rash in her lower extremities and ankles was erythema nodosum. She also had discomfort, which could have been inflammatory arthritis. \r\nDoctor: Doctor X, did you confirm with any tests? \r\nDoctor_2: Yes. There was an initial S E D above one hundred and ten and her C P R was increased. \r\nDoctor: Great. In the visits after, were there any other problems found? \r\nDoctor_2: The reports says that no other abnormalities were found. However, I do see something about her first visit. \r\nDoctor: Could you explain what it says?\r\nDoctor_2: She has some M T P detected, which could have been signs of erythema nodosum. However, the Dermatology did not agree, and they believed it to be venous stasis. \r\nDoctor: The venous stasis could have been related to the fracture, right? \r\nDoctor_2: That is correct. \r\nDoctor: Her initial visit reports suspicion of I B D, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus. Why was that? \r\nDoctor_2: She had a questionable rheumatoid fracture even though her C C P was negative. Her A N A was positive at one to four zero. There was a persistent speckled pattern. However, the rest of the lupus serologies were negative. \r\nDoctor: What lupus serologies were used? \r\nDoctor_2: Double stranded D N A, R N P, Smith, R O, and L A were used. \r\nDoctor: How did her cardiolipin antibodies panel look? \r\nDoctor_2: They were all negative. We made sure I g M, I g G, and I g A were less than ten. \r\nDoctor: I see. Was there anything else in the report? \r\nDoctor_2: She had her beta 2 glycoprotein one or R V V T tested. \r\nDoctor: That seems important because of the livedo pattern. \r\nDoctor_2: Exactly. That's why they concluded it was an onset of lupus and not rheumatoid arthritis because the arthritis couldn't be associated with erythema nodosum. \r\nDoctor: Why did she undergo a C T scan?\r\nDoctor_2: We feared she had lymphoma. The scan of her chest, abdomen, and pelvis were done to rule out sarcoid. \r\nDoctor: I see. The results came out normal, right?\r\nDoctor_2: That's correct. \r\nDoctor: Did you change some of you habits to help your bowels, ma'am? \r\nPatient: I tried my best to. \r\nDoctor: That's good. What was found Doctor X? \r\nDoctor_2: There was evidence of B twelve deficiency with a high methylmalonic and high homocystine levels along with a low normal B twelve in addition to iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low M C V.\r\nDoctor: That gives the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease, right?\r\nDoctor_2: Correct. That's stated in the report. \r\nDoctor: Were there any tests done to confirm this? \r\nDoctor_2: She underwent a colonoscopy, which showed nothing. Her endoscopy was also normal. Recently, she underwent a second coloscopy, and no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was seen after viewing it microscopically. \r\nDoctor: Nothing was seen microscopically? \r\nDoctor_2: Actually, we determined there were aggregates of eosinophils. \r\nDoctor: That sounds important. That could be due to an allergic reaction or an emergence of Crohn Disease. I will have to discuss with Doctor Y from Gastroenterology to see the significance. \r\nPatient: Could I interrupt for a second? I don't think my B twelve and iron deficiency were looked at while I stayed in the United States. \r\nDoctor: Is that correct, Doctor X?\r\nDoctor_2: That is. I think these details were from somewhere else. \r\nDoctor: At least we are aware of it. What medication was provided during her first visit? \r\nDoctor_2: It looks like she was placed on forty milligrams of prednisone. The strength was reduced over time. \r\nDoctor: This may be a reason to her acne. Was she taken off this medication?\r\nDoctor_2: Yes, she was. There were too many adverse effects. \r\nDoctor: What was she places on after?\r\nDoctor_2: It looks like she started a point six m g colchicine, which she took daily. \r\nDoctor: How were her inflammatory markers after taking it? \r\nDoctor_2: Her markers were under control and positive. She also didn't have any evidence of erythema nodosum. \r\nDoctor: That is great. How did you like that medication, ma'am? \r\nPatient: My ankle would swell up and hurt. There were also some sensitive rashes on the skin of my legs. \r\nDoctor: I see. Is that stated on the report, Doctor X? \r\nDoctor_2: It is. I also see that she was reevaluated by Dermatology. \r\nDoctor: Did they find anything apparent? \r\nDoctor_2: No, they didn't. They didn't find any evidence of erythema nodosum. \r\nDoctor: What was the plan following that? \r\nDocotr_2: It looks like we proceeded with a D E X A scan and checked her vitamin D levels. \r\nDoctor: Was there any medication prescribed? \r\nDoctor_2: We ordered vitamin D and calcium to be bought over the counter so that her bones were protected. However, they use of them was stopped until we figured out the underlying cause of her disease. \r\nDoctor: I see. Other than the fracture and jaw surgery, was there anything else? \r\nDoctor_2: It shows she had Varicella and Mononucleosis, correct ma'am? \r\nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. \r\nDoctor: That's good. Our recent physical exam with you from last August showed changes in your venous stasis and diffuse periarticular ankle edema. Fortunately, we did not find any erythema nodosum, but the livedo patter was still present. \r\nPatient: I see. Did you find anything else? \r\nDoctor: We did find a heart murmur, so we will conduct an echocardiogram. Doctor X, could you confirm all the details form the workup, please?\r\nDoctor_2: Of course. Her A C E levels were normal. Her sed rate was around 30, which was high. Before that, it was around one ten, which is even higher. Her R V V T was normal. The rheumatoid factor was negative. The urinalysis was also normal. She had a C R P level of two point three, which was high. Her C C P came out negative. Her C B C displayed microcytosis and hypochromia with hematocrit levels of thirty seven point seven. Her hematocrit levels improved to forty point three later on, and she did not have any hypochromia, microcytosis, or anemia present. \r\nDoctor: Thank you for all that information. Does all this information and history seem to be correct, ma'am? \r\nPatient: Yes. Thank you for going over that in front of me. \r\nDoctor: No problem. I see you're here today regarding some mild but intense skin rashes. You mentioned that you thought it was erythema nodosum, correct? \r\nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. I think it's on my ankles. I also feel some joint stiffness. \r\nDoctor: I will take note of that. You also mentioned something about a rash before. Did you have a rash that was sensitive to U V light, like sunlight? \r\nPatient: That's right. I had it twice when I was in Europe. \r\nDoctor: When did you notice the rashes? \r\nPatient: I was skiing, and my face started to swell up. \r\nDoctor: I see. Do you think it had to do anything with your acne? \r\nPatient: No. My acne was stable after I stopped taking that one medicine and started the other. \r\nDoctor: The prednisone and colchicine we mentioned earlier, correct? \r\nPatient: That's correct. \r\nDoctor: Is there anything else you would like to ask? \r\nPatient: I am trying to get pregnant and would like to know if the medication has any effects on pregnancy. \r\nDoctor: I'll discus that with you right now. \r\nPatient: Actually, could you provide me with a pamphlet?

        "section_text": " \r\nThe patient is a 25-year-old female with a history of erythema nodosum. She was diagnosed in 2004 after a biopsy was done that confirmed erythema nodosum. She had undergone a colonoscopy to address secondary diseases that may have been present because of the erythema nodosum. The findings were uncertain if the terminal ileum had abnormal biopsies. However, the skin biopsy mentioned some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cells in the subcutis. She had cosmetic surgery done on her jaw. She visited our clinic and the Dermatology several times, and we suggested the rash in her lower extremities and ankles was erythema nodosum. She also had discomfort, which could have been inflammatory arthritis. Her initial SED was above 110, and her CPR was increased. She had a questionable rheumatoid fracture even though her CCP was negative. Her ANA was positive at 1 to 40. There was a persistent speckled pattern. However, the rest of the lupus serologies were negative. Double-stranded DNA, RNP, Smith, RO, and LA were used. They were all negative. She had evidence of B12 deficiency with high methylmalonic and high homocystine levels along with a low normal B12 in addition to iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low MCV. This gives the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease, which was stated in the report. She underwent a colonoscopy, which showed nothing. Her endoscopy was also normal. Recently, she underwent a second colonoscopy, and no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was seen after viewing it microscopically. However, we determined there were aggregates of eosinophils. She was placed on 40 milligrams of prednisone, which was reduced over time. She was taken off this medication because of too many adverse effects. She started a 0.6 mg colchicine, which she took daily. Her markers were under control and positive. She also didn't have any evidence of erythema nodosum. Her ankle would swell up and hurt. There were also some sensitive rashes on the skin of her legs. She was reevaluated by Dermatology, but they didn't find any evidence of erythema nodosum. We proceeded with a DEXA scan and checked her vitamin D levels. We ordered vitamin D and calcium to be bought over the counter so that her bones were protected.",

            "This is a 25-year-old woman who is attending psychology classes.  She was diagnosed with presumptive erythema nodosum in 2004 based on a biopsy consistent with erythema nodosum, but not entirely specific back in Netherlands.  At that point, she had undergone workup which was extensive for secondary diseases associated with erythema nodosum.  Part of her workup included a colonoscopy.  The findings were equivocal characterizes not clearly abnormal biopsies of the terminal ileum. The skin biopsy, in particular, mentions some fibrosis, basal proliferation, and inflammatory cells in the subcutis. Prior to the onset of her erythema nodosum, she had a tibia-fibula fracture several years before on the right, which was not temporarily associated with the skin lesions, which are present in both legs anyway.  Even, a jaw cosmetic surgery she underwent was long before she started developing her skin lesions.  She was seen in our clinic and by Dermatology on several occasions.  Apart from the first couple of visits when she presented stating a recurrent skin rash with a description suggestive of erythema nodosum in the lower extremities and ankle and there is discomfort pointing towards a possible inflammatory arthritis and an initial high sed rate of above 110 with an increased CRP.  In the following visits, no evident abnormality has been detected.  In the first visit, here some MTP discomfort detected.  It was thought that erythema nodosum may be present.  However, the evaluation of Dermatology did not concur and it was thought that the patient had venous stasis, which could be related to her prior fracture.  When she was initially seen here, a suspicion of IBD, sarcoid inflammatory arthropathy, and lupus was raised.  She had an equivocal rheumatoid fracture, but her CCP was negative.  She had an ANA, which was positive at 1:40 with a speckled pattern persistently, but the rest of the lupus serologies including double-stranded DNA, RNP, Smith, Ro, La were negative.  Her cardiolipin panel antibodies were negative as well.  We followed the IgM, IgG, and IgA being less than 10.  However, she did have a beta-2 glycoprotein 1 or an RVVT tested and this may be important since she has a livedo pattern.  It was thought that the onset of lupus may be the case.  It was thought that rheumatoid arthritis could not be the case since it is not associated with erythema nodosum.  For the fear of possible lymphoma, she underwent CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  It was done also in order to rule out sarcoid and the result was unremarkable.  Based on some changes in her bowel habits and evidence of B12 deficiency with a high methylmalonic and high homocystine levels along with a low normal B12 in addition to iron studies consistent with iron deficiency and an initially low MCV, the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease was employed.  The patient underwent an initially unrevealing colonoscopy and a capsule endoscopy, which was normal.  A second colonoscopy was done recently and microscopically no evidence of inflammatory bowel disease was seen.  However, eosinophil aggregations were noted in microscopy and this was told to be consistent with an allergic reaction or an emerging Crohn disease and I will need to discuss with Gastroenterology what is the significance of that.  Her possible B12 deficiency and iron deficiency were never addressed during her stay here in the United States. In the initial appointment, she was placed on prednisone 40 mg, which was gradually titrated down this led to an exacerbation of her acne.  We decided to take her off prednisone due to adverse effects and start her on colchicine 0.6 mg daily.  While this kept things under control with the inflammatory markers being positive and no overt episodes of erythema nodosum, the patient still complains for sensitivity with less suspicious skin rash in the lower extremities and occasional ankle swelling and pain.  She was reevaluated by Dermatology for that and no evidence of erythema nodosum was felt to be present.  Out plan was to proceed with a DEXA scan, at some point check a vitamin D level, and order vitamin D and calcium over the counter for bone protection purposes.  However, the later was deferred until we have resolved the situation and find out what is the underlying cause of her disease. Her past medical history apart from the tibia-fibular fracture and the jaw cosmetic surgery is significant for varicella and mononucleosis. Her physical examination had shown consistently diffuse periarticular ankle edema and also venous stasis changes at least until I took over her care last August.  I have not been able to detect any erythema nodosum, however, a livedo pattern has been detected consistently.  She also has evidence of acne, which does not seem to be present at the moment.  She also was found to have a heart murmur present and we are going to proceed with an echocardiogram placed. Her workup during the initial appointment included an ACE level, which was normal.  She also had a rather higher sed rate up to 30, but prior to that, per report, it was even higher, above 110.  Her RVVT was normal, her rheumatoid factor was negative.  Her ANA was 1:40, speckled pattern.  The double-stranded DNA was negative.  Her RNP and Smith were negative as well.  RO and LA were negative and cardiolipin antibodies were negative as well.  A urinalysis at the moment was completely normal.  A CRP was 2.3 in the initial appointment, which was high.  A CCP was negative.  Her CBC had shown microcytosis and hypochromia with a hematocrit of 37.7.  This improved later without any evidence of hypochromia, microcytosis or anemia with a hematocrit of 40.3. The patient returns here today, as I mentioned, complaining of milder bouts of skin rash, which she calls erythema nodosum, which is accompanied by arthralgias, especially in the ankles.  I am mentioning here that photosensitivity rash was mentioned in the past.  She tells me that she had it twice back in Europe after skiing where her whole face was swollen.  Her acne has been very stable after she was taken off prednisone and was started on colchicine 0.6 daily.  Today we discussed about the effect of colchicine on a possible pregnancy.": 0.29482636428065195,

Unbeknownst to the patient was the fact that she had been chosen to be the \"assassin.\" Prior to boarding the airplane her children hid a toy gun in her carry-on luggage. As the patient walked through security the alarm went off and within seconds she was surrounded, searched and interrogated. She and her family eventually made their flight, but she seemed unusually flustered and disoriented by the event. In prior times they would have expected her to have brushed off the incident with a \"chuckle.\" While in Colorado her mentation seemed slow and she had difficulty reading the lines to her part while playing \"Murder She Wrote.\" She needed assistance to complete the game. The family noted no slurring of speech, difficulty with vision, or focal weakness at the time. She returned to work at a local florist shop the Monday following Thanksgiving, and by her own report, had difficulty carrying out her usual tasks of flower arranging and operating the cash register. She quit working the next day and never went back.

The patient would benefit from a subtalar arthrodesis, possible autograft, and lengthening of the Achilles. The patient will need to undergo another procedure until his foot matures some more. The risks of surgery include risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for other surgical procedures, and need to be nonweightbearing for some time. The doctor will use prophylactic antibiotics to minimize the infection risk. The patient will not be able to walk again right after the surgery and will need to stay off it for a while, which is not permanent. The total risks of surgery are low. The patient and family have agreed to the surgery.<|im_end|>": 0.16377171215880892

Given all of her symptoms, I recommended a calcaneal osteotomy and Achilles lengthening procedure. The procedure entails straightening out the heel and getting everything lined back up. The risk of infection is less than one percent, and we use antibiotics to control for infection the entire time. The patient will be asleep for the entire procedure. After the procedure, the patient will need to be nonweightbearing for six weeks at minimum and will need a brace for at least six months. Other risks include bleeding, changes in sensation in most of extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, possible nonunion, possible failure to correct all the deformity, and need for other surgical procedures. The patient and her family have decided to go ahead with the procedure. \r\n\nNote: The input conversation has been edited for clarity.\n\n": 0.14342629482071714

            " \nThe patient is a 10-year-old boy who had a fracture dislocation of the left elbow and a fracture of the neck of his right glenoid after falling off a quad bike on October 10th, 2007. He has been experiencing stiffness and has been going to physiotherapy and using Dynasplint. His left elbow fracture has healed, and the doctor suggests another surgery to remove the hardware, which may help decrease some of the irritation with elbow extension. The doctor explains that the risk of infection is less than one percent, and prophylactic antibiotics will be used to control for infection and keep everything clean. Other risks include bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremities, failure to remove hardware, failure to relieve pain, and continued postoperative stiffness. The doctor explains that the patient will be under anesthesia during the surgery, and that the surgery may not completely fix his pain. The family agrees to the surgery as they believe boys should be playing sports with their friends.\n\nExample 2\n": 0.19909502262443438

I see here it says you had severe sinusitis two to three months ago, correct? \r\nPatient:  Is that what they're calling my nasal problems? \r\nDoctor: Yeah, it is. Sinusitis is the inflammation of your nasal airways. \r\nPatient: I see. Thank you for describing it to me. \r\nDoctor: No problem. Would you be able to describe to me what you had been feeling two to three months ago? \r\nPatient: Yeah, I can. My face would feel uncomfortable, my nose was stuffy, my eyes hurt, and I felt something dropping in the back of my throat.\r\nDoctor: Have you ever been prescribed any medication? \r\nPatient: Here's the list of medicine I was taking. \r\nDoctor: I see you were given antibiotics, correct? \r\nPatient: I was, but I don't know what those are. Could you explain them to me? \r\nDoctor: Antibiotics are usually used to fight infections. \r\nPatient: I had an infection? I thought I just had some nasal problems. \r\nDoctor: Your report states you had a severe infection. Do you remember if the antibiotics helped? \r\nPatient: Not really. I felt like my symptoms were the same. \r\nDoctor: I see. Did your doctor order any advanced imaging's? \r\nPatient: Yeah. They did a C T scan of my nose. Here is the report from my C T scan. \r\nDoctor: Let me take a look. It looks like you had some thickening of the mucosal layer in your right paranasal sinus. You also had some obstruction in your right ostiomeatal complex and excess growing of some of the bones in your nose. Uhm. Oh, one more thing. I see your nasal septum was shifted to the left. \r\nPatient: Oh, wow. Thank you for explaining everything to me. \r\nDoctor: No problem. Going back to your list of medications, I know you took antibiotics for your infection, but did you take any medication for your sinuses? \r\nPatient: No, I haven't. I did try this cream for my nose, but that didn't work either. Nothing worked! \r\nDoctor: I see. Looks like the cream you used was a topical nasal corticosteroid. Are there any other symptoms that you have been experiencing? \r\nPatient: I've had some trouble with my balance, and I feel like I've lost some of my hearing. I thought this was odd since I'm only fifty years old. I think my ears felt plugged or full of air, so they just needed to pop. \r\nDoctor: I see. Let's perform an audiogram test to check your ears. \r\nPatient: Sounds good. \r\nDoctor: I'm seeing that you have some mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Your tympanometry seems to be normal. Your speech discrimination was also normal. \r\nPatient: That's reassuring. \r\nDoctor: I want to ask a few more questions about your ears. Do you feel any fullness or pressure?  \r\nPatient: No, I don't feel anything like that right now. \r\nDoctor: Do you hear any humming, buzzing, or roaring sounds?\r\nPatient: Nope. I don't hear anything like that. \r\nDoctor: We checked your ears and now understand more about the problem, but I wonder why your balance is affected. When did you start noticing your balance was affected? \r\nPatient: I think it could have been to this one medicine that starts with an A. I forgot the name, but it didn't really help my nasal problems. It just made my balance worse. \r\nDoctor: Was the medicine called Allegra? \r\nPatient: Oh, yeah. That's what it was called. I thought I had some sort of allergy, so I thought it would help. \r\nDoctor: I see. Did you ever feel any dizziness too? \r\nPatient: Yeah, I did. \r\nDoctor: I will have you do some movements to see if your dizziness occurs. \r\nPatient: Sounds good. \r\nDoctor: Could you look to the left and then look to the right. \r\nPatient: Oh, wow.

She has pretty significant calcaneal valgus deformity. \r\nPatient: What does that mean, doctor? \r\nDoctor: Your heel is out of alignment, sweetie. Do you have pain?\r\nPatient: Yes, I have a lot of pain, doctor. \r\nGuest_family: What can we do about this, doctor? \r\nDoctor: Well, given all of her symptoms, I think we should do a calcaneal osteotomy and Achilles lengthening procedure. \r\nGuest_family: What does that procedure entail? \r\nDoctor: Well, in short, we'll go in there and straighten everything out, and get everything lined back up. \r\nGuest_family: What's the risk of infection with the surgery, sir? \r\nDoctor: Actually, it's less than one percent, so it's extremely low.\r\nGuest_family: How is this possible, doctor?\r\nDoctor: We use antibiotics to control for infection the entire time. \r\nGuest_family: That's great. Will she be asleep for this procedure? \r\nDoctor: Yes, we'll use anesthesia the entire time. She won't feel a thing. \r\nGuest_family: Okay, that's good too. What about after the procedure? What's the protocol?\r\nDoctor: Well, I'll need your help. We have to be strict about her being nonweightbearing for six weeks at minimum. \r\nGuest_family: Will she need a brace too?\r\nDoctor: Yes, at least for six months, but if she does everything I ask of her, it will be only six months. \r\nGuest_family: Okay, yes, I think we should do the procedure. What do you think, honey?\r\nPatient: Yes, I want to get back to playing sports with my friends.\r\nDoctor: The other risks include bleeding; changes in sensation in most of extremity; hardware failure; need for later hardware removal; possible nonunion; possible failure to correct all the deformity; and need for other surgical procedures.  I would not worry about these issues, though. It is quite rare. So, looking at her radiographs, the spinal arch is definitely collapsed. I think you guys are making the right decision.",

It is the means by which information is shared, ideas are exchanged, and tasks are accomplished. Effective communication is essential to the success of any organization. It is important for employees to communicate effectively with each other, with their superiors, and with customers. \n\nOne of the most important aspects of communication in the workplace is that it helps to establish clear expectations. When employees know what is expected of them, they are more likely to perform well. Communication also helps to build trust and respect among colleagues. When employees feel that they can trust and respect their colleagues, they are more likely to work together effectively. \n\nEffective communication is also important for conflict resolution. When conflicts arise, it is important for employees to be able to communicate their concerns and work together to find a solution. Without effective communication, conflicts can escalate and lead to a toxic work environment. \n\nCommunication is also important for employee engagement. When employees feel that they are being heard and that their opinions matter, they are more likely to be engaged in their work. This can lead to increased productivity and job satisfaction. \n\nIn conclusion, communication is a vital aspect of any workplace. It is important for establishing clear expectations, building trust and respect, resolving conflicts, and engaging employees. Employers should encourage effective communication among their employees and provide training if necessary. By doing so, they can create a positive work environment that is conducive to success. \n\nTotal Words: 250.0\nTotal Characters: 1359.0<|im_end|>",

I have high blood pressure, asthma and sleep apnea. I had blood clots in my left leg about six months ago. I also have cancer. \r\nDoctor: What kind of cancer do you have? \r\nPatient: I have stomach cancer. They also did a total abdominal hysterectomy. \r\nDoctor: Did they put you on an anticoagulant medication for the blood clotting? \r\nPatient: Yes. I took it for six months. I stopped taking it and then I had the stroke. \r\nDoctor: Have you had any other surgeries? \r\nPatient: Yes. I had a colonic resection to remove benign polyps. I had another benign lump removed from my breast.  \r\nDoctor: How are you feeling today? \r\nPatient: I am still having weakness in my left leg. That is why I still have to us my walker, but I have been able to get around easier. \r\nDoctor: Have you been experiencing any daytime fatigue? \r\nPatient: No. I have been falling asleep at work. I think it is from looking at my computer screen all day. My supervisor caught me snoring one day and forgot where I was at. My supervisor offered to give me a coffee. This has happened more than once. \r\nDoctor: This could be due to your sleep apnea. Who is treating you for your sleep apnea? \r\nPatient: Doctor X did a consult and had me do one of those sleep test about two years ago. I only get sleepy when I look at my computer screen. \r\nDoctor: Did Doctor X recommend a C P A P machine to use at night? \r\nPatient: Yes, but I never used to use it. I had another follow up visit with her and she told me that I need to use it every night. I have been using it every other night. \r\nDoctor: How much uninterrupted sleep do you think that you get per night? \r\nPatient: Maybe two to five hours, on a good night. \r\nDoctor: That is not enough sleep. No wonder you are falling asleep at work. I recommend following up again with Doctor X regarding your sleep apnea. You are at a much higher risk for obesity and high cholesterol if you continue to not address the issues you have been having with the lack of sleep and sleep apnea. \r\nPatient: Okay.
