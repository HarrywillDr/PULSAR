bilat fluffy infiltrates) and patient intubated.
- Confused after getting ativan, requiring soft restraints.
- Decision made to give Xigris (96hr) after head CT done & negative.
- Started Solumedrol 1g/d per rheum & derm, who are concerned that she

subclavian vein are patent with normal flow characteristics.
2. Small volume lymph nodes seen in left supraclavicular fossa and
posterior
aspect of left side of neck, also seen on recent CT scan.
TTE: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal
diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There
is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild right ventricular cavity enlargement with low normal
free wall motion. Borderline pulonary artery systolic hypertension.
These findings are suggestive of a primary pulmonary process (or could
be related to intubated state).

mg/dL
Fluid analysis / Other labs: Immunoglobulin G 506* mg/dL (normal:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 10254**])
Imaging: neck ultrasound: 1. Left internal jugular vein and left
subclavian vein are patent with normal flow characteristics.
2. Small volume lymph nodes seen in left supraclavicular fossa and
posterior
aspect of left side of neck, also seen on recent CT scan.
TTE: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal
diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There
is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild right ventricular cavity enlargement with low normal
free wall motion. Borderline pulonary artery systolic hypertension.
These findings are suggestive of a primary pulmonary process (or could
be related to intubated state).
Microbiology: blood cx c gpcs in pairs and chains from day of admission
-HIV negative, sent Immunoglobulin panel
-respiratory viral antigen negative from swab and BAL, awaiting culture
until take off respiratory precautions; still on H1N1 treatment
ECG: -neck ultrasound shows normal flow through int jug and subclav,
some LNs
-echo shows no vegetations; just pulmonary artery HTN"

1.Large right-sdied rectal sheath hematoma with active contrast
extravasation.  Hematoma extends inferiorly into the pelvis but it is
still preperitoneal.  There is no free pelvic fluid.  There is
extensive anterior abdominal wall fat stranding.
GB/Liver U/S:
No evidence for cholecystitis or cholelithiasis.  Apparent ill-defined
isoechoic mass in the left lobe of the liver could be further evaluated
by CT.

1. There is dilatation and distention of the esophagus around a gastric

in particular, aspiration must be considered.
2. Compared to the most recent cross-sectional study, the CT
examination of [**2155-4-16**] there has been interval mild progression of
ascites and bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Diffuse small bowel dilatation is identified. There is no evidence
of pneumatosis nor of a transition point. In the colon there Appears to
be pancolitis and C-Diff is suspected.
4. Pancreatic lesions, likely cyst or pseudocyst cysts and unchanged
from prior MR examination.
5. There is no evidence of vascular abnormality outside the varices and

The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no valvular
aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is likely related
to high cardiac output. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
No vegetation seen (cannot definitively exclude)."

aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is likely related
to high cardiac output. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
No vegetation seen (cannot definitively exclude)."

Imaging: CXR: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with
patient sitting
upright position. Comparison is made with the next previous available
chest
examination of [**2194-10-23**]. The patient has recently undergone
implantation of a left-sided permanent pacer seen in anterior axillary
position. The pacer is connected to a dual electrode system. One of
these is
terminating in a position compatible with the right atrial appendage.
The
second with two electrode enforcements representing the ICD terminates
in a
position compatible with the apical portion of the right ventricle.
Heart
size is unchanged and remains within normal limits. No pulmonary
congestion
is seen and no pneumothorax can be identified."

60 year-old female with metastatic renal cell carcinoma to
the lung and brain, now presents with worsening L-sided weakness
and headaches. She reports headaches began this morning in
association with dizziness and mild nausea. The patient called [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 7952**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7953**], RN and was instructed to take decadron 10mg and come to the
emergency room. Of note, the patient has experienced R-sided headaches,
L-sided weakness and numbness, incoordination, muscle stiffness, and
fatigue since [**Month (only) 594**] and has gradually deteriorated since then, becoming
hemiparetic requiring a walker. She has undergone biopsies of the brain
lesion and cyberknife SRS. Recent MRI ([**2175-9-22**]) demonstrates an
increased lesion (2 x 3 x 2cm) with extensive edema and mass effect on
the motor strip. She was scheduled for resection with Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] on
[**2175-10-13**].
In the ED, she had a seizure, witnessed by her family, lasting
approximately 2 minutes. Prior to onset, she complained of
worsening R-sided head discomfort. She had eye deviation to the
right and tonic-clonic movements of UE and LE, bilaterally. She
was given 2mg ativan; the seizure stopping during administration.

-EGD showed friability at site of anastamosis which was injected and
blood in stomach.  Varices were noted in the lower third of the
esophagus.
- GI recommending repeat EGD with EUS when bleeding stops to evaluate
for ulcers
- could not get PICC due to long line for PICC
- octreotide drip stopped because there was no evidence of bleeding
varices
- GI recommended checking a gastrin level
- Hct 31.1 --> 28.8 --> 1 unit PRBCs --> 30.5 --> 29.0 --> 1 unit PRBCs
- Hypernatremia improved with D5W 151 --> 147
- Echo performed: Normal global biventricular systolic function.
Limited study
- iron studies show iron deficiency anemia so started on iron
supplements
*will need PICC placement or Left IJ today *
